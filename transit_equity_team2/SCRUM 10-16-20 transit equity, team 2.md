# What has the team done towards the project this week?
- made [backlog](https://github.com/cumason123/transit-equity/projects/1) to track progress
- mapped census tract data to counties 
- collect data on MBTA bus stops; found a [dataset](https://geo-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/2c00111621954fa08ff44283364bba70_0?selectedAttribute=stop_name) with an API and aggregated csv files
- met with team 1 and discussed further on how to split up work
- read [study on free buses for Worcester](http://www.wrrb.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/WRRB-FareFree-Transit-Report.pdf)

# What does the team plan to do this week?
- map bus stop lon/lat data to country / tract #'s
- assign income bracket to each tract
- look into ridership data and ideally map to each stop

# Is the team having issues?
- waiting to hear back from client on how to split RTA portion between both groups (right now we are focusing on MBTA)
