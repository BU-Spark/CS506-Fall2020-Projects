# What has the team done towards the project this week?
- looked into negative census income data
- looked into creating a tableau to visualize data

# What does the team plan to do this week?
- create mappings between datasets
- identify the top 10 lowest income routes (and define a practical metric for this)
- calculate costs for making a bus route free (need additional data from client)

# Is the team having issues?
- we do not have annual fares and ridership per bus stop for any of the RTA, so we are waiting on the client to provide us this data
