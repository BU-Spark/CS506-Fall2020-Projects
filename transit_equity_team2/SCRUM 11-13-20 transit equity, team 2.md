# What has the team done towards the project this week?
- created Tableau visualizations mapping bus routes and bus stops (separately) with the corresponding median household income of the census tracts

# What does the team plan to do this week?
- map bus routes and bus stops together into one Tableau visualization
- look for census population data and map those to tracts instead of ridership data

# Is the team having issues?
- we are missing data on 3 of the 15 RTAs which we will try to find
- after speaking with spark/pm/client, we are shifting our analysis from ridership to population (which requires us to look for a new data)
