This project involves building on a proof of concept for evaluating media coverage of Black Americans in Boston for the past 5 years including sentiment analysis, levels of overall coverage, homicide coverage, and unique topic words used around black people and predominantly black neighborhoods and sub-neighborhoods.

* **data_visualization**: Contains the CSV files and python code used to analyze neighborhood coverage, topic mentions, and gun violence coverage for each news source as well as the resulting visualizations created as PNGs
* **docs**: Contains the PR template used for our team repo (irrelevant)
* **EDA Census_Articles**: Contains the iPython notebook for the EDA used for the census data and articles 
* **model_results**: Contains PNG and TXT files of the results and metrics from the Bidirectional LSTM with and without Attention
* **modules**: Contains the python code used for the Bidirectional LSTM with Attention Layer
* **notebooks**: Contains the iPython notebooks and relevant CSV files used for sentiment analysis and Doc2Vec topic modeling
