52,This wasn’t forecast to be a good week of weather  and it’s still looking that way  There are showers in the forecast much of the rest of the week with tomorrow the only exception  Showers this time of year usually don’t bring a washout to the area and are highly variable as to which city or town sees them The reason you see showers in the forecast is because there is a chance of them  but in reality most of the time is dry this week  The best chance for rain will be later this afternoon and evening and then again Friday This morning we find a lot of clouds around and it’s rather muggy  This air is only going to be here temporarily as a front from the ocean brings a cool but drier air mass to the area tomorrow  Along the immediate coastline on Wednesday temperatures will likely not exceed 70  but inland areas will reach the lower 70s  There will be a blend of clouds and sunshine and overall it will be a nice day Another low pressure area and frontal complex approaches for Thursday and Friday with more showers  The timing is looking like Thursday morning is dry with an increasing chance of showers later in the day continuing into Friday morning   Depending on how quickly the system exits will determine if Friday evening and Saturday morning are nice Sunday appears to be the best day of the upcoming weekend Tuesday  Lots of clouds and mostly dry  A bit muggy with a few scattered showers late morning and afternoon  Highs of 74 to 79 Tuesday night  A period of showers and possible thunderstorms for the first part of the night  then turning cloudy  Lows of 55 to 60 Wednesday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Cool at the coast  Highs of 65 to 74 Thursday  Mostly cloudy with a chance of  a few showers and highs in the lower 70s Friday  A period of showers  mostly in the first part of the day  Highs of 70 to 75 Saturday  Partly sunny and warmer  Highs in the mid to upper 70s Sunday  Mostly sunny with highs of 75 to 80 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
53,A rather summer like night gave us the opportunity to enjoy sleeping with the windows open  listen to the sounds of summer and not use the heat Tuesday evening Wednesday brings another very warm day for the middle of October with highs between 75 and 80 Wednesday afternoon  There will be some breaks of sunshine  but also periods when it is completely overcast  I am not expecting any shower or rain activity  as that remains well to the west of New England Wednesday night continues warm and somewhat muggy with a slight chance of a shower towards dawn While there could be some scattered showers Thursday morning  it’s really the homebound commute and during the Patriots games when the rain chance increases  Some of the rain could be quite heavy and accompanied by thunder with gusty winds  It will remain warm and muggy all day with highs in the 70s Friday morning brings an end to the showers and a return to sunshine  It’s going to continue to be quite warm with highs once again near 70  The humidity will be gone and winds will be a bit brisk  but overall  it’s going to be a great day Saturday is generally dry although there is a slight chance of a pop up shower late in the day  Most of the day will be sunny and warm  with highs near 70  Sunday is much colder with highs only in the mid 50s  If you are headed to the Head of the Charles Regatta this weekend you’ll want to dress for the warmth on Saturday and the chill on Sunday Wednesday  Breeze and warm with clouds and a few periods of sunshine  Highs 75 80 Wednesday night  Cloudy and mild  Lows in the mid 60s Thursday  Cloudy and muggy  Showers becoming more numerous late in the afternoon   Highs in the lower 70s  Heavy rain overnight Friday  Mostly sunny and pleasant  Highs 70 74 Saturday  Mostly sunny  slight risk of a pop up shower late in the day  Highs near 70 Sunday  Mostly sunny  though cooler with highs in the mid 50s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
54,Clouds gave way to sunshine for some areas of the region Tuesday and the afternoon turned out a lot nicer than expected  However  heavy rain will spread throughout the area from the northeast Wednesday  becoming heavier and steadier as the day goes on While rain will be limited for the morning  the evening commute looks wet  and the later you leave the wetter it should be Tonight brings the core of the rainstorm  Rain will be steady overnight without any real break in the action  If you are traveling overnight expect roads to be wet The rain will be heavy at times Wednesday night into Thursday morning with a widespread 1 to 3 inches of rainfall  The heaviest rain will likely fall northeast of Boston with Essex County having the greatest potential to reach 3 inches of rain There is an outside chance some areas will see over 3 inches  but these would be the exception The rain will taper to showers on Thursday  but we will have to wait until late Friday for clearing to take place  Friday is still cloudy  although there could be some breaks in the cloud cover by that day The weekend is looking much better with a blend of clouds and sunshine with seasonable temperatures around 60 degrees  The nice weather will continue into next week with a warming trend Wednesday  Rain overspreading the area  Some embedded showers could be heavy  Highs in the mid 50s Wednesday night  Rain  may be heavy at times  Chance of thunderstorms  Lows around 50 Thursday  Steady rain in the morning  showers in the afternoon  Highs near 60 Friday  Lots of clouds  a morning shower  Highs near 60 Saturday  Partly sunny  with a high near 60 Sunday  Mostly sunny  with a high near 60 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
55,Today begins with cold weather  but temperatures will rise a bit this afternoon  reaching the middle and upper 30s  Winds are still going to be brisk  but it won’t be as bitter as Thursday Sunshine will dominate much of today with a few clouds showing up around sunset  The clouds are the forerunner of milder air arriving overnight  There could be a quick sprinkle of rain Saturday morning  However  sunshine is going to break through the clouds and allow temperatures to reach spring like levels in the lower 50s Saturday afternoon Don’t become accustomed to the milder air as another arctic high builds south from Canada for Sunday  Temperatures Sunday will be some 15 degrees colder than the previous day  and with a wind from the northwest  it’s going to feel cold On Monday there will be a storm passing off the Mid Atlantic coastline  If this storm tracks northward  then we are going to be looking at another snowstorm  Right now  the highest probability for snow is expected to occur across the southern part of Massachusetts  but a slight shift north would bring the storm to the New Hampshire border  A shift further south will keep the storm from creating a mess on Monday Cold weather continues through the middle of the week with a moderation in temperature for the start of astronomical spring on Thursday Today  Mostly sunny  Though not as cold as past few days  still blustery  Highs in the 30s Tonight  Cloudy and milder with lows in the lower 30s  A quick shower possible before dawn Saturday  Any morning showers end  then skies become partly sunny with milder highs between 50 55 degrees Sunday  Sunny  blustery and cold again  Highs in the mid 30s Monday  Mostly cloudy  Snow possible  especially south of the Pike  Highs in the upper 20s Tuesday  Dry and continued unseasonably cold weather You can follow David s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

58,Bright sunshine will bounce off the freshly fallen snow today making it quite picturesque across the region  Most areas saw 7 to 12 inches of snow in yesterday’s storm with Bristol County  southern Plymouth County and Cape Cod receiving 2 to 6 inches on average  On Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket  the storm started as snow but quickly changed to rain There was a period of flurries in the early morning hours Thursday  so roads and walkways may have some black ice once again  Take care as you head to work or school this morning and don’t forget your sunglasses  You’ll need them It’s cold and dry for several days ahead as high pressure builds into the region   At night  under mainly clear skies and increasing amounts of moonlight  temperatures are going to fall into the single digits and teens statewide  During the day through Saturday all areas  except extreme southeastern Massachusetts  will remain below freezing While the sun is certainly getting stronger day by day  the cold is going to last for a while  The atmosphere is in a state where storms can develop  It’s just a matter now of the exact track of these storms For Sunday  a storm will develop in the ocean  but most indications are the brunt of the snow stays off the coast  We could see a few periods of snow showers Sunday and early Monday  While a storm is no longer likely  I will continue to be watching for any changes Next week  the next storm threat arrives sometime during the middle of the week Thursday  Lots of sunshine and light winds  Highs in the mid 20s Thursday night  Partly cloudy with a low of 5 to 10  low teens on Cape Cod and the Islands  Friday  Mostly sunny with highs in the mid 20s  A bit breezy in the afternoon Friday night  Mostly clear and cold with low windchills  Lows in the 6 to 12 range Saturday  Mostly sunny and cold with highs of 25 to 30 Saturday night  Partly cloudy with lows in the teens Sunday  Mostly cloudy with a chance of a few snow showers or flurries  especially along the coast  Highs of 26 to 31 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
59,You likely noticed the strong breeze late yesterday which kept up overnight  This wind brought milder air to the region and is one of the reasons it s so much milder this morning than it was yesterday Today will feature more clouds than the past couple of days  but it will still be mild  Highs this afternoon will again reach the 60s with the exception of south facing coastal areas and Cape Cod  where it remains in the 50s  There is the chance of a few showers today  but the bulk of any shower activity will be brief  lasting an hour or less The one downside to this weekend s forecast is the fact that the front bringing showers to the area later today is moving very slowly  This will allow a small area of rain to ride along the front Saturday morning and keep clouds and the chance of showers over Cape Cod for the first several hours after sunrise Saturday  To the north  including Boston  any early clouds will clear and leave us with a pair of wonderful days Temperatures over the weekend will be quite mild and actually quite a bit above normal  In terms of averages  it s going to be May like this weekend  and by Monday  many places will likely see their first 70 degree day of the season Don t get to comfortable with the warm air  however  It will turn colder later next week with highs returning to the chilly upper 40s to mid 50s range  more typical of early spring Today  Mild with lots of clouds and a few showers  Most of the day is dry  Highs in the 60s  except 50s on Cape Cod Tonight  A few showers early otherwise cloudy  clearing toward morning  Lows 37 44 Saturday  Sunny with a high in the lower 60s  Across Cape Cod  early clouds will depart leaving partly sunny skies with highs in the 50s Saturday Night  Mostly clear with a lows in the lower 40s Sunday  Mostly sunny and very mild with highs 63 68 but cooler over Cape Cod and Cape Ann in the 50s Monday  Mostly sunny and warm with highs 67 74  Cooler over Cape Cod and Cape Ann 
60,A mid fall nor’easter is going to impact our weather through the end of the week before clearing takes place for the weekend Nor’easter is a term used for a low pressure system that moves up the coast — it doesn’t matter the time of year nor do nor’easters have to bring snow   They do bring a northeasterly wind direction  and that’s what we will have for the next few days The rainfall with this system will come in several waves  At times it may rain quite hard while at other times it’s just going to be cloudy  I suspect the rainfall totals will vary considerably across southern New England  especially if there are embedded thunderstorms which can increase the rainfall The system will only move a few hundred miles over the next four days so you are going to hear and read about the lousy weather for the rest of the workweek  Temperatures will not be very cold during this storm with highs reaching the upper 50s to near 60 Tuesday  Cloudy and mild with highs near 60  Scattered showers and a chance of a thunderstorm Tuesday night  Periods of showers with lows around 50 Wednesday and Thursday  Periods of rain with highs in the upper 50s Friday  A chance of a few showers  Some breaks of sun possible in the afternoon  Highs of 55 to 60 Saturday  Mostly sunny with a high in the lower 60s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
61,A chilly morning for much of New England as high pressure remains in control with Canadian origins  This weather system is the reason it was so cool over the weekend and why temperatures continue to be a bit below average today  While it s feeling like fall  there will be abundant sunshine and light winds Later tonight a cold front will push into the area  This front is going to bring a good chance of showers toward morning and right now the Tuesday morning commute could be wet Tuesday will not be a washout  but there will be a period of showers in the first half of the morning  Most areas will see a tenth to a quarter of an inch of water which is greatly needed in many areas After the rain ends  clearing will take place and the sun will be back for the afternoon  The middle of the week looks dry and cool with abundant sunshine  Temperatures will be chilly each morning and the coolness will peak at the end of the week when some interior towns could see readings in the 30s  I am not expecting a widespread frost however The weekend is setting up to be spectacular with abundant sunshine and pleasant temperatures  While the month started out on a summery note  since that first week of heat of and humidity it s certainly been quite fall like  Have a great week Monday  Sunny with a high in the mid to upper 60s  Light and variable wind Monday night  Cool with more clouds  Lows in the upper 40s to lower 50s Tuesday  Morning showers then clearing and pleasant  Highs in the mid to upper 60s Wednesday  Sunny with a high near 70 Thursday  Mostly sunny with highs in the upper 60s Friday  Sunny with a high in the mid 60s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

63,After a period of above average temperatures  a return to colder  more seasonable conditions this week  As high pressure moves in from Canada it will suppress weather systems south of the region  This means  while it will feel more like winter  it s still going to look like fall Temperatures will be slightly below average this week  but not on the extreme side of things  Highs will be near 40 today  but then we are going to see about 72 84 hours below freezing  This will freeze up the ground again deeper than it s been since November Late in the week a storm will approach from the south  but temperatures will also be warming  This means there could be some snow  but rain is likely going to fall at some point this coming weekend along with milder air Sunset is becoming later by about 1 min each day so you will likely notice it s light just a bit further into the afternoon  As the saying goes  as the days lengthen  the cold strengthens Monday  Sunny with a high near 39  West wind of 5 to 8 mph with gusts as high as 23 mph Monday night  Partly cloudy and cold with lows of 17 to 23 Tuesday  Mostly sunny and cold  Highs of 25 to 32 Wednesday  Mostly sunny with a high in the upper 20s Thursday  Sunny with a high near 32 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 35 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
64,Thursday was a typical late October day  and Friday will be similar to start  but end up not as mild   We have rain in the forecast for Saturday afternoon and night  but Friday evening should be mostly dry for the kids One of the reasons it’s going to be cooler Friday is we will have an easterly wind coming in off the ocean  This wind direction brings us cool Atlantic air and keeps temperatures lower Most of the treat or treat activities take place between 4 p m  and 9 p m   and temperatures will fall from around 50 degrees at sunset to the mid 40s later in the evening  There could be a bit of drizzle in the air  but I am not expecting enough rain to warrant wearing raincoats over the costumes Saturday morning is dry  but showers of rain will move into the area in the afternoon and then become a steadier rain overnight  Winds will also increase and become quite gusty along the coast There is a chance for some scattered power outages if winds become strong enough late Saturday night   Don’t forget to set your clock back an hour If you are headed to the Patriots game Sunday the good news is skies will clear  and I am not expecting any precipitation  The bad news is winds will be gusty and temperatures will be falling to the upper 30s by the end of the game  Dress warmly if you are going to be there A double barreled storm system will give southern New England a glancing blow before heading into Canada on Sunday  Behind this system the coldest air of the season will bring a freeze to many areas Monday morning  A warming trend begins Tuesday with temperatures returning to above normal by the middle of next week Friday  Increasing clouds  cooler with highs in the lower to middle 50s  Chilliest along the coast Friday night  Raw and chilly  a few showers late at night  Lows in the mid 40s Saturday  Periods of rain and becoming breezy  Highs 47 52 Sunday  An early shower  then clearing and blustery  Highs only in the mid 40s Monday  Sunny  with a high near 48 after a cold start Tuesday  Mostly sunny and turning milder in the afternoon  Highs in the mid 50s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

66,A very cold Thursday morning across the area will lead to a few snow showers in the afternoon  Just like during the summer when showers are in the forecast  not everyone will see them  If you do get one of these quick bursts of snow  it will likely occur after but before sunset and the ground could be dusted with some snow at most The cold continues through the day with highs not reaching the 30s  The exception will be south of Plymouth  where highs will nudge the 30 degree mark  I don’t expect any travel troubles from the weather through either commute  even if you do see a snow shower The dry cold conditions continue into Friday  our coldest day of this latest arctic outbreak  Highs will stay in the lower to mid 20s in the afternoon Over the weekend  clouds will start to move into the area and although there is the chance for a few snow showers Saturday night and again Sunday  any steady precipitation will hold off until overnight Sunday or early Monday  I’ve been advising folks not to make travel plans Monday or Tuesday next week  It continues to appear a long drawn out period of snow or mixed precipitation will affect areas from D C  to Portland  Maine  Snow amounts are likely going to be significant enough to plow a few times and causes delays and cancellations Cold dry weather returns after the storm leaves with no sign of any warming for the start of March Thursday  Morning sunshine then clouds and the chance for snow showers  Highs 25 30  Winds will make it feel a lot colder in the afternoon Thursday night  Clearing and cold  lows 7 12  Wind chill will fall below zero Friday  Sunny  blustery and cold with highs in the lower to mid 20s Saturday  Mostly cloudy with a highs in the lower 30s Sunday  A chance of snow showers with a lot of clouds  Highs in the lower 30s Monday  Snow likely  Highs only in the upper 20s Tuesday  Unsettled in the morning  clearing late in the day  Highs in the 20s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
67,A bright start to the day doesn t mean it s going to be storm free  A fast moving system headed east will bring more inclement weather to the area this afternoon and evening Across the northern parts of Middlesex and Worcester counties it will be cold enough for some wintry precipitation  Snow  sleet and even freezing rain could make travel thick this afternoon north of Route 2 and into southern New Hampshire In metro Boston and across the rest of southern New England a period of rain with a quarter to half an inch of water will occur this afternoon  The rain begins between 1 and 3 p m  and then ends a few hours later  The evening commute won t be anything like last night  but the rain will create slow travel again It does fall below freezing tonight so there will be a freezing of any standing water Thursday is my pick of the week with highs in the lower and middle 40s  More rain is back Friday with even milder temperatures melting some of the deep snow After a seasonable and storm free weekend  arctic air returns for next week Wednesday  Sunshine for a few hours this morning but then becoming cloudy  Rain after 1 p m  in most places but 1 to 3 inches of snow  sleet and a bit of freezing rain for northern Worcester and the extreme northern section of Middlesex counties Wednesday night  Showers end early this evening  Then clearing and colder with lows of 25 to 31 Thursday  Sunny and spring like  Highs of 40 to 45 Friday  Showers  breezy and mild  Highs of 45 in the northern part of the state and nearing 52 in Boston and Cape Cod Saturday  Mostly sunny with a high near 47 Sunday  Partly sunny with a high near 41 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
68,Some snow and sleet fell across the interior Tuesday night making for slick driving  But Wednesday morning we find temperatures warm enough for rain not snow and you can expect just wet roads It’s not going to rain all day  but there is a chance of showers for several hours  Temperatures will climb into the lower 50s in Boston  but even warmer southwest of the city  Across the northwest suburbs it will stay in the 40s  but still warm enough to avoid any frozen precipitation Clearing takes place overnight as temperatures fall back into the 20s to around freezing  Winds should be strong enough to dry the roads  so I am not anticipating any issues with ice for Thursday morning A pair of chilly but nice days will end the workweek before our next weather maker brings more rain for the weekend  Inland areas could see some snow or sleet over the weekend depending on how the storm tracks and how much cold air ends up working into the system  Presently  this looks to be primarily a rain maker for most of the area The unsettled pattern looks to continue into early next week with periods of shower and raw conditions  Today   A few periods of showers  but much milder with highs between 52 and 60  It will be the mildest south of Boston  Temperatures remain in the 40s north and west of Route 495  Tonight   Clearing but windy and cold with lows between 28 and 33  Thursday   Sunny with highs between 36 and 41  Friday   Partly sunny with highs in the upper 30s  Saturday   Showers with highs likely in the mid 40s  Sunday   Lots of clouds  raw and cool with a few showers with highs in the lower 40s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
69,Most of the shower activity from the overnight is now moving north of the region  This will leave the area with damp roads and some showers this morning but not heavy rain and not a large impact to the morning commute  Clouds will still dominate much of the day  although there will be breaks of sunshine this afternoon as temperature remain mild in the 40s to near 50 over Cape Cod Another weak weather disturbance brings a few showers overnight and into the first part of Thursday  Some of the higher elevations may see a few snow showers but nothing significant Colder and drier weather with abundant sunshine closes out the week and starts the weekend  If you have shopping or parties to attend  the weather won’t stop you this weekend A storm will pass out to sea south of the Boston area on Sunday or Monday and may bring a quick bit of a rain or snow showers later in the weekend  Presently  this still appears to be a minor system  The next weather maker comes about Christmas eve  but this one looks too warm for snow  The odds of a White Christmas are fading fast  but not impossible yet Wednesday  A few morning showers  then clearing and blustery  Highs in the mid 40s Wednesday night  Blustery along with a period of showers late at night  Some snow in the higher elevations  Lows of 33 to 39 Thursday  Any rain or snow showers ends  followed by a blend of clouds and sunshine but not as strong  Highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s Friday  Mostly sunny with light winds  Highs in the upper 30s Saturday  Mostly sunny with a high around 40 Sunday  Clouds thickening with a chance of a rain or snow shower  Highs of 38 to 42 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
70,A storm skirts by to our south today  The only thing you may notice in the area are a few clouds  The thickest clouds will be on the south side of Cape Cod  but even on the Cape plenty of sunshine will be seen Sea breezes keep the coast cool and won’t let temperatures get out of the 40s  Once you move about 10 miles away from the water  the mercury won’t be so affected by the chilly ocean and highs over metro west will reach the mid and upper 50s this afternoon  It’s not out of the question a few towns like Framingham  Sudbury  and Brockton could nudge 60 for an hour or two The clear weather continues overnight with temperatures falling into the lower 30s inland and mid 30s at the coast  A few of the colder spots will see upper 20s for Thursday morning More sunshine continues Thursday with highs a few degrees cooler across the board   Opening Day at Fenway Park looks sunny in the morning with some clouds but no rain for the first pitch A few hours of rain for late Friday night and Saturday will end and it looks mild later Saturday afternoon  Sunday is certainly the pick of the weekend and the day to plan to be outside Wednesday  Mostly sunny with highs in the 40s at the coast and the upper 50s inland Wednesday night  Mostly clear with a low of 32 to 38 Thursday  Sunny and seasonable with highs in the lower 50s Friday  Sunny morning with some afternoon clouds  Cool at the coast with highs in the 40s but in the 50s to the west Saturday  Rain likely early in the morning  Highs in the upper 50s Sunday  Sunny with a high in the range of 50 to 55 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
71,I hope you got at least a few moments to be outside yesterday  It’s not too often we start December with temperatures in the mid 60s  It’s back to reality today with highs only in the mid 30s  This afternoon  cities and towns north and west of Route 495 will likely struggle to reach freezing temperatures  The ground will once again feel frozen and it will look very wintry by the end of the day As milder air moves north  clouds are going to increase and winds will turn onshore  This east wind will ensure areas along the coast do not have any frozen precipitation tonight and early Wednesday  Far inland  where the cold air is more entrenched  a period of snow  sleet and even freezing rain will create several hours of slick driving later this evening and perhaps continuing into the very early pre dawn hours of Wednesday  There could be an inch or two of snow in these areas with just a coating as you move closer to Route 495 This is a nuisance event  but even a small amount of snow and ice can cause problems with driving  By Wednesday morning most areas will see readings above freezing and the threat of any frozen precipitation will decrease rapidly Dry and seasonable conditions return for Thursday  It might turn unsettled later in the weekend  but I don’t see any major snow in the forecast for now Tuesday  Increasing clouds with a high near 35 Tuesday night  Rain  or a mix of rain  snow and sleet  becoming all rain after midnight  Temperatures rising overnight to near 40 by dawn Wednesday  Showers likely early  Highs of 55 to 60 over southeastern Massachusetts but only in the upper 30s in the Worcester hills Thursday  Mostly sunny with a high near 40 Friday  Partly sunny with highs in the mid 30s Saturday  Lots of clouds — perhaps some rain  Highs in the upper 30s to mid 40s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
72,A very cold start to the morning will be followed by the coldest day so far this fall  High pressure is building in from Canada  the same system bringing the cold and almost unprecedented lake effect snow to areas along Lake Erie Sunshine will be prevalent all day  but won t do much to warm the ground and air  A weak system will cross the region overnight with some clouds and a slim chance of a shower of snow or rain on the Cape and the Islands  Most areas will stay dry Tomorrow is a bit milder with a southwest flow of air  but it won’t last  Cold air moves in for Friday and Saturday with brisk conditions and temperatures well below seasonal average On Sunday  the jet stream will lift north  and milder air will stream into New England  If you re headed to the Patriots game  expect temperatures to be in the lower 50s at kickoff Some shower activity will move in for Sunday night and early Monday  but it will remain very mild  Highs on Monday reach the 60s  so if the ground is still frozen this weekend  it will thaw A period of rain may linger into Monday night  We ll see a slow cool down into Thanksgiving  which currently appears to be dry and seasonable Wednesday  Sunny with winds still brisk  Highs 30 to 35 Wednesday night  Slight chance of snow showers late at night  Lows in the 20s Thursday  Mostly sunny  Not as cold  but still breezy  Clouds may linger  Highs 40 to 45 Friday  Sunny  highs in the upper 30s Saturday  Sunny  with highs 35 to 39 Sunday  Clouds and breaks of sunshine  Highs in the lower 50s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

74,A few rain and snow showers will fall across the area this morning as storm system passes by the region  The precipitation will quickly come to an end this morning and the wind will be the weather feature you will notice most of the day  Although temperatures will be typical for the second half of December  the winds will make it feel a lot colder than that High pressure brings sunshine back to the area on Friday and lingers into Saturday  It’s a chilly temperatures regime  but with dry roads shoppers can take heart the weather won’t slow them down  Sunday is a cloudier day and any precipitation that falls either as a rain or snow shower will be light It’s dry again on Monday before another storm takes shape in the center of the country   This storm is going to propel a lot of rain and a lot of warm air into the region for Christmas eve and the first part of Christmas day  Temperatures could reach 60 degrees during this period and with a lot of rain  which could cause street and stream flooding The storm will depart and colder and drier air will move into the area thereafter  There’s a chance the storm ends as a bit of snow later on Christmas  but I don’t want to get your hopes up of a white Christmas even in the last few hours   This is a warm storm  but sometimes they can bring a bit of snow on the back side before they move into Canada Today  Windy with a few scattered snow and rain showers early in the morning with highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s Tonight  Partly cloudy and windy early with lows between 25 to 30 Friday  Mostly sunny and cold with highs between 33 and 38 Saturday  A blend of clouds and sunshine with brisk temperatures between upper 30s to lower 40s Sunday  Mostly cloudy  but some sunny break   Highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s with a few rain and snow showers possible Monday  Mostly cloudy with a high near 41 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
75,A bit of overnight snow ended in the wee hours of the morning  Skies will be bright and sunny today with cold temperatures  The dry weather continues for the first half of the week as cold Canadian high pressure builds into the region Later this week a new storm will move up the coastline and likely bring a heavy period of precipitation to much of the area  The exact track of this storm will ultimately determine the precipitation type  If the storm stays just off the coast of Cape Cod it could bring a significant snow event to parts of the area The Thursday morning commute will be the first commute of the week to be impacted by weather Behind the storm dry weather returns for the weekend with temperatures at more seasonable levels  A few small disturbances could bring some light rain or snow showers during this period Monday  Mostly sunny with highs in the upper 20s Monday night  Clear and quite cold  Low of 5 to 15 Tuesday  Sunny and cold with highs only in the mid 20s  A cold wind chill brings temperatures below zero at times Wednesday  Sunny with a high of 24 to 30 Wednesday night  Becoming cloudy with snow beginning before the morning commute  Lows in the upper teens to mid 20s Thursday  Snow and or rain likely depending on the track of the storm  High of 32 to 39 Thursday night  Precipitation ending  Lows in the upper 20s Friday  Partly sunny with a high near 35 to 40 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

77,If you read our forecast Tuesday  you know I was thinking a storm off the south coast might bring clouds and some showers to Cape Cod  But it now appears as if the storm is going to come quite a bit closer to New England  bringing with it a chance of rain The highest risk for significant rain is south of the Massachusetts Turnpike  but this could change later Wednesday as new information becomes available  I am more confident of at least some beneficial rain to some of the driest areas of the region Thursday afternoon and night The amount of rain will depend on the exact track of low pressure moving along the New England coast  The closer to the coast the storm  the more rain we will see This isn’t unlike a winter storm where we are looking at the exact track to determine snowfall amounts As the storm pulls away on Friday  clearing will allow more sunshine to boost temperatures back toward 70  Over the weekend  a warmer flow of air brings summer like readings and dry conditions  Highs this weekend will be nearly 10 degrees over the average  reaching 80 or a few degrees higher  especially on Sunday I do hope we see the rain Thursday  because with the heat coming this weekend the gardens could really use it Wednesday  Sunny  with highs in the upper 60s Wednesday Night  Partly cloudy  with a low 45 50 Thursday  Cloudy rain developing south to north  Cool  Highs in the 60s Friday  Turning partly sunny  with a high near 70 Saturday  Sunny  with a high near 80 Sunday  Sunny  with a high in the lower 80s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
78,If you can tolerate the cold and damp day today the balance of the work week looks sunny and more seasonable  Today  most of the region will see highs in the 30s to low 40s which is far below average for the time of year  but not even close to how cold it could still be You will need rain gear all day  and  although it won’t rain the entire day  there will at least be drizzle in the air much of the day  When it does rain  the rain could come down quite hard and a return of big puddles is possible so take care driving This evening the overall trend will be for the area of precipitation to push off the coast  Don’t be surprised if you see some wet snow or sleet pellets mixed in with the rain today and this evening  The atmosphere is marginally cold enough for this to take place Clearing will be slow to occur on Tuesday morning  but by the time the afternoon arrives it should be mostly sunny and quite spring like  I’d suggest you will be able to enjoy lunch outside a day or two this week The weekend may turn unsettled with more precipitation with rain to start  More on this throughout the week and on my twitter feed Monday  Periods of drizzle and some sleet pellets with areas of rain this afternoon  Highs in the upper 30s Monday night  A period of rain this evening may end as snow or sleet briefly  Lows of 32 to 36 Tuesday  Clouds clearing in the morning and ending up mostly sunny in the afternoon  Brisk with highs in the mid to upper 40s Wednesday  A blend of clouds and sunshine with highs in the lower 50s Thursday  Mostly sunny and pleasant  Highs of 51 to 56 Friday  More sunshine with highs of 47 to 51 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
79,A cool morning will transition into a warmer afternoon with highs reaching the upper 60s and lower 70s   There will be plenty of sunshine this morning  However  clouds will increase during the afternoon  and there is the chance for showers and storms later this afternoon and early evening The area will stay dry through the early afternoon before any storms develop and move southward Not everyone will see showers and storms  but if you do there is the chance the storms could bring heavy rain and even hail  The air above us is still quite cold  which could help hail form The front responsible for the upcoming showers and storms will move through the area overnight  The Red Sox game could be delayed at times if one of these storms hits the Fenway area  By Saturday morning  most  if not all  of the showers are over  but clouds will remain for a few hours  The weekend s trend will reveal increasingly sunny skies  but Saturday will also turn a bit cooler in the afternoon  It will mostly be in the 60s tomorrow Sunday is the pick of the weekend with constant sunshine and highs in the 70s  The day looks to be a nearly perfect start to June  Warm weather will continue into early next week before a renewed shot of cool and rainy weather comes around for the middle of next week Friday  Mostly sunny  but with a chance of showers or a storm this afternoon  Highs in the upper 60s to mid 70s inland Friday night  Scattered showers and storms the first half of the night  before turning just cloudy  Lows 48 52 Saturday  Cloudy and raw early  then increasingly sunny and cool  Highs in the mid to upper 60s Sunday  Sunny with highs between 70 76  but turning cooler at the beaches in the afternoon Monday  Mostly sunny and warm  Highs between 75 80 Tuesday  Clouds and some sun  Showers possible in the afternoon with a high in the lower 70s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
80,Overall the weather for much of the week is going to be dry  I do mention the chance of showers Tuesday and Friday  but the showers will be light and not amount to much  The biggest aspect of the weather you will notice this week will be the temperatures  Today will be the warmest day with highs getting into the lower 80s in many areas  Even much of the upper part of Cape Cod will be well into the 70s this afternoon with a westerly wind If you happen to have today off it s actually a really great day for the beach  A few clouds will show up later this afternoon and evening and a front starts to move north  The system won t make it very far as another front coming in from the ocean will drive temperatures to much cooler levels for Tuesday  If you sleep with the windows open tonight you will likely be chilly in the morning Tuesday brings a lot of clouds  perhaps some drizzle along the coast and a shower  Most of the day is dry  Highs will be as much as 25 degrees cooler than those we will see today  Wednesday is a bit milder with highs back into the lower 60s  There will still be a lot of clouds  but some sun as well  The end of the week brings a trickier forecast as there are signs of some steady rain for later Friday or Saturday  More on the weekend forecast later in the week Monday  Sunny with a high of 80 to 85  65 to 75 on the outer Cape Islands   West wind of 6 to 11 mph Monday night  Turning much cooler late at night with a brisk breeze and a chance of showers  Lows in the mid 50s Tuesday  Lots of clouds and mostly dry but with a stray shower  Highs of 55 to 59 Wednesday  Cloudy with a few sunny breaks  Highs of 59 to 64 Thursday  Mostly cloudy with a high near 70 to 75 Friday  More humid with a few scatter showers  Highs in the upper 60s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
81,Dry and sunny weather is on tap for Monday  The arctic air comes back with a vengeance for the rest of the week  Daytime temperature readings remain in the teens and night time lows heading near or below zero are going to make our January thaw a pleasant memory very quickly There is a chance of more snow later next week  but the models are having a rough time with the evolving pattern  and I have low confidence in the timing and strength of any storms right now Monday  Partly sunny with a high of 35 to 40  This will be the last day above freezing for the next five Monday Night  Turning cold by morning  Lows 10 to 15 Tuesday  Partly sunny and very cold  Highs of 15 to 22 Tuesday Night  Mostly cloudy with a low between  3 and 10 Wednesday  Mostly sunny with a high in the mid teens Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom This article was originally published on January 18  2014 
82,We do have the chance of showers again Wednesday and while not all of us are going to see showers  some of us will see a heavier downpour  All of this is due to a cold front slicing through New England  but eventually the front will move far enough away to cut down on the rainfall Humidity has been high the past few days  but is going to start to tumble Wednesday and really dry out for the weekend if the upper flow turns enough to bring Canadian air back to the region It looks like Thursday afternoon  as an upper level disturbance passes  a few more showers can pop up  But  interestingly enough many of us will end up dry through this entire showery period The weekend is looking amazing with abundant sunshine and warm air  There won t be much humidity at all in the air  so you can likely sleep with the windows open and enjoy the dry air As we enter week two of August we have yet to have an official heat wave in Boston  It s certainly not out of the realm of possibility that we make it through the summer without one  but there is still plenty of time left for it to happen  Stay tuned Today  Lots of clouds  a risk of showers and thunderstorms   Some showers could be strong   Highs in the upper 70s to near 80 Tonight  A chance of showers and thunderstorms early then turning drier by morning   Lows in the lower 60s Thursday  Lots of sunshine to start the day then increasing clouds and the chance of a few pop up showers   Highs in the upper 70s Friday  Early morning ground fog otherwise partly to mostly sunny and pleasant  Highs around 80 Saturday  Sunny  with a high in the lower 80s  cooler at the beach Sunday  Sunny and warm highs in the lower 80s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
83,A sparkling day will cap off a week that showcased a lot of different weather Yesterday s wind was rather significant  but today  the wind is gone  leaving us with a much calmer and bright day  Highs today will reach the lower 60s inland but stay in the cooler 50s at the coast when the sea breeze starts this afternoon  The east wind  which is very chilly in late April  is going to play into our forecast for much of the upcoming period Tomorrow morning looks wet  as a vigorous weather system will cross the area  The showers will begin before sunrise and end late in the morning  However  even if it s dry  skies are likely to continue into the afternoon It will be very raw tomorrow with highs in the 40s  There may be a few light showers Saturday night  but the evening will not bring any heavy rain  Sunday looks to be mostly cloudy and Saturday s cool temperatures are likely to persist with highs reaching the upper 40s to lower 50s  Some rays of sunshine might break through the clouds  however  there is also the chance of a brief  light shower Most of next week is expected to remain chilly  with the past weeks  60 degree readings becoming a distant memory as several days stay plunged into the 40s Friday  Sunny with highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s  It will be coolest at the immediate coastline Friday night  Clear early then clouding up with showers developing before sunrise  Los in the lower 40s Saturday  Morning showers  and even some downpours  Very raw with highs only in the 40s  Most of the rain will end by noon Saturday night  The nighttime will be raw and chilly with very light showers  Lows in the mid 30s to lower 40s Sunday  Chilly and cool  Lots of clouds with a few breaks of sunshine  Highs in the 50 55 degree range Monday  Mostly sunny with a high near 55 inland  but upper 40s in Boston and at the coast Tuesday  Partly sunny and chilly with highs between 46 52 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

85,Although predicted snow totals for this storm are small  it s the timing of the snow and the colder weather that will create a slower drive to work Thursday morning Rain will become heavier and steadier Thursday evening  As the storm moves through the area overnight  some street flooding from the heavy rain could occur  Additionally  colder air is going to rush into the back of the storm  changing the rain to freezing rain  sleet and eventually a quick period of snow before ending The rapid fall in temperatures Thursday morning will create a “flash freeze” in many locations  After a small amount of snow has fallen on top of very wet roads  it will leave the area vulnerable to the quick ice up Travel Thursday morning will likely be quite difficult for a few hours while the roads are treated and the precipitation shuts off  Thursday is going to be very cold and very windy Cold weather continues overnight and Friday morning before turning a bit milder for the afternoon  Saturday is my pick of the weekend  with sunshine and highs approaching 50 once again  It does turn colder  but dry  for the first half of next week Wednesday  Cloudy with rain late this afternoon  Highs in the 40s Wednesday night  Rain during the first half of the night  Rain changes to freezing rain  sleet and then snow by sunrise  The earliest change will occur north and west of Rt  2 and the Mass  Pike  Temperatures mild early but falling below freezing after midnight Thursday  Blustery and cold with any snow ending  Highs in the low 20s but wind chill near 0 at times  Some breaks of sunshine developing in the afternoon Thursday night  Clearing and cold  Lows between 1 and 10 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 31 to 37 Saturday  Partly sunny with a high of 46 to 51 Sunday  Mostly sunny and seasonable  Highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s You can follow David s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom This article was originally published on March 12  2014

87,This is going to be a hot week  but it s the start of July  and the fact it s hot is about as noteworthy as it being cold in January  That said an increasingly warm and humid flow of air from the tropics will create a pattern that brings the hottest stretch of the summer so far to the region  Highs the next few days are going to be in the 80s to lower 90s with the core of the heat and humidity likely being Wednesday Today is a great beach day  and although it will be warm  the humidity won t be so bad as to make it extremely uncomfortable  Tonight begins the first of several nights of sticky weather when  if you don t have air conditioning  it s going to be difficult to get a good nights sleep  I know some of you like this weather  but I think the majority of us prefer the nights as they have been  cool and dry Showers are not a risk until Wednesday  On that day the risk is still small  but  because the heat will be so high  it might build up enough to produce a few storms  Those that do see rain might see heavy rain  Most of us stay dry Thursday is the day with the greatest chance of rain and thunderstorms  There are many towns with fireworks on the 3rd  and these could be delayed As a cold front passes through the area late Thursday night and Friday I expect these showers to continue  Friday  if the front keeps moving  will clear and there won t be any issues for all the activities  However  if the front slows we could see a lot of clouds and a few showers  I ll have a better idea on the timing of the clearing as the week progresses Monday  Sunny with highs in the mid 80s  Cooler on the south coast Monday night  Partly cloudy  Not as comfortable for sleeping  Lows of 63 to 68 Tuesday  Mostly sunny  hot and humid  Highs of 85 to 90  Cooler on the south coast Wednesday  Very humid and hot  Highs in the lower 90s  Cooler on the south coast Cape Cod  There is the risk for a pop up shower or storm  especially west of Route 128 Thursday  A blend of clouds and sunshine with scattered showers and storms  Highs of 88 to 93 Friday  Lots of clouds  A risk of showers and storms but most of the time is dry  Highs in the 80s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

92,Compared to the past two days  a stark contrast in weather is expected the next couple of days  We won’t see much  if any  sunshine today or tomorrow  and there is rain back in the forecast  After a few morning showers the bulk of today is actually dry  However  there is the risk for some showers this afternoon  and if you see one it could contain some heavier rain The overnight period will be cloudy and damp  but generally rain free   Tomorrow a low pressure area will move up along the coast and bring another period of showers or a steady  rain to the area  There is still some discrepancy as to exactly how far north the rain shield will move  It appears right now the heaviest rain will be south of the Massachusetts Turnpike  but all areas will see at least some rain tomorrow Depending on the exact strength of the storm  rainfall could amount to more than an inch  I will be watching the afternoon models closely and be updating the forecast on Twitter The storm moves away on Friday and skies will partially clear  There is still a very small chance of a shower Friday  The weekend is looking fantastic with sunshine and warm temperatures  Highs both days over inland areas will reach 80 or higher  and even Cape Cod will be in the mid 70s much of Sunday — June weather at its finest There is still no sign of significant heat or humidity for southern New England as the jet stream remains in a position keeping the summer heat at bay for now Wednesday  Cooler with scattered showers and a thunderstorm possible  Much of the time will be rain free  Highs in the mid to upper 60s Wednesday night  Lots of clouds and still the risk of a few showers  Lows in the 50s Thursday  Periods of rain  Cool with highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s Friday  A blend of clouds and sunny periods  Risk of a shower or thunderstorm  Highs in the lower 70s Saturday  Mostly sunny with a high near 80 Sunday  Mostly sunny with highs in the lower 80s  cooler on Cape Cod and the Islands  Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
93,A few early snow showers will leave the area as the morning commute winds down  Clouds will then be the dominate weather feature for the day as temperatures remain in the 30s Milder air brings us a taste of spring again Tuesday as highs reach back in the 50s  It will be a breezy day  but  with the high in Boston near 52  it’s going to be a nice time to get outside A storm is still on target for Wednesday into Thursday  Right now it appears that enough warm air will still be in the area as the storm begins so that we see rain  As the storm passes by our area and colder air rushes back into the system  the rain will change to snow before it ends How much snow falls will depend on the precise way the low forms  how strong it gets and how quickly it moves  The best chance to see plowable snow will be north of the Massachusetts Turnpike and west of Route 495  but the system  which will bring us the rain and potential snow  is still just coming onshore in California  Later today and certainly by Tuesday I will have a more detailed look at accumulation Right now  the Wednesday morning commute does not look to have any problems from snow  The rain likely will also begin after the commute  Later that day  some far western and northern areas may see some snow for the evening commute  And all of us have the potential for some snow Thursday morning before any snow ends Cold weather is ahead for Friday with a warming trend into the weekend Monday  Snow ends early and then just mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 30s to low 40s Monday night  Cloudy and not very cold  Lows in the upper 20s and low 30s Tuesday  Mostly sunny  breezy and mild  Highs in the upper 40s and lower 50s Wednesday  Rain developing later in the morning  Rain could be mixed with snow in far northern areas  Highs in the 30s to mid 40s Wednesday night  Rain changing to snow by morning with lows falling to the teens and 20s  Accumulating snow most likely north and west of Boston  but even Boston could get light accumulation Thursday  Early snow ending Thursday night  Partly cloudy and cold  Lows of 8 to 18 Friday  Sunny with a high in the lower and middle 30s You can follow David s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
94,Dense fog is a problem Thursday morning in many places and will last for several hours  impacting visibility for the morning commute  As the sun gets higher Thursday  the fog will dissipate but leave clouds  There could also be a couple of showers  but the bulk of the day is dry Early Thursday night  as a weak system brushes the area  you might see a snow shower  but most of you will not see any precipitation  It won’t be very cold with lows just below freezingFriday is going to be a very nice day by January standards  and  while we won’t hit 50  it will reach the lower and perhaps mid 40s  A low pressure area will develop near us Friday night and Saturday  but most of the moisture remains off the coast  There will be a chance of a period of showers of rain or snow early Saturday Sunday is dry with a blend of clouds and sunshine  While temperatures will be above freezing  rising into the mid 30s  it will feel quite cold compared to our recent thaw MLK Day is dry and chilly  but not very cold for January  If you are thinking winter is over  think again  It’s going to turn quite cold late next week  and while the coldest of air will likely stay over the Midwest  we are going to see several shots of arctic air after Jan  23 which could last into the first half of February There is a chance of some snow early next week  A series of weak weather systems will continue to affect the area through early next week  Temperatures will slowly trend back to normal with highs remaining in the 30s and eventually falling further as we start the final week of January Thursday  Fog dissipates this morning with cloudy skies  A quick rain shower is possible this afternoon  Highs 38 to 44 Thursday Night  An early snow shower  but otherwise clearing and cool  Lows 27 to 35  Friday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Highs in the lower and mid 40s Friday Night  Cloudy and raw  Temperature in the mid  20s in the North and the mid 30s on the Cape and the islands Saturday  Cloudy with a few rain or snow showers possible  Highs in the upper 30s to mid  40s Saturday night  Clearing and colder  Lows 22 to 32 Sunday  Partly sunny  with a high in the mid  30s Monday  Partly sunny  with highs 35 to 43Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
95,A warm week  actually warmer than any week in August  continues  The humid air will be with us through Tuesday night High pressure offshore continues to pump a very tropical air mass into the region  This air is actually giving us the warmest week we have experienced since July There is a slight risk for a shower this afternoon as temperatures reach their peak around 2 p m  Anytime you have highs in the upper 80s with so much humidity showers are possible Tonight a cold front will pass through the region  This will bring a chance of storms  Some of the storms could contain strong gusty winds and heavy rain The humidity will fall tomorrow during the day  and  while it will be warm  it won t be as muggy  A more comfortable air mass means it will be easier to sleep tomorrow night Warmer than average readings continue Thursday through Saturday as well  Later Saturday a cold front will bring another chance of showers along with a blend of clouds and sunshine  If you are looking for more typical September temperatures you ll have to wait until Sunday  By the end of the weekend highs will stay in the 70s — until then it s summer weather  Have a great day Tuesday  Mostly sunny and warm  A small risk of a thunderstorm in the afternoon  Highs in the mid to upper 80s Tuesday night  An evening thunderstorm — otherwise warm and muggy  Lows near 70 in Boston and upper 60s in the suburbs Wednesday  Mostly sunny  turning drier  Highs in the lower 80s Thursday  Sunny with a high of 80 to 85 Friday  Sunny and warm with a high of 80 to 85 Saturday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A few afternoon showers with highs in the 80s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
96,From  warm and dry  to  cool and damp   our weather is making a sharp turn  Unfortunately  the cooler weather isn’t accompanied by any significant rain in spite of showers and the chance of drizzle being in the forecast  The moderate drought rolls on this week north of Cape Cod A cold front passed through the area yesterday ushering in cooler air along with a persistent northeasterly flow of air off the ocean  Any time of year when the winds are northeast it means marine air and the ocean influence dominates the forecast  With longer nights it will be more difficult for the sun to warm the ground and in turn break up any low clouds and fog which form overnight Drizzle will also make an appearance as the air becomes more saturated  We are many inches below normal in terms of rainfall and while sunshine is limited the next few days  so too is any significant rain Small areas of steady rain will try to make a run at the region  but it appears much of it will remain off the coast  As another front approaches the area later this week and at the start of the weekend showers are more likely and perhaps even some widespread measurable rain The sunniest day of the rest of the week is shaping up to be Friday with seasonable temperatures  Thursday afternoon could also see some breaks of sunshine and conditions continue to be somewhat stable  Enjoy the cooler air  Fall is here Tuesday  Lots of clouds and a few morning showers  Cool and raw with highs in the lower to middle 60s Tuesday night  Lots of clouds and cool  Some spotty drizzle  Lows of 51 to 56 Wednesday  Mostly cloudy with a few morning showers or areas of drizzle  Continued cool with highs of 62 to 66 Thursday  Morning drizzle  then clouds with some sunny breaks  Highs in the mid 60s Friday  Mostly sunny with a high of 65 to 68 Saturday  Showers likely with highs in the mid 60s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
97,I was thinking this morning what a great week of weather it is going to be for vacationers  It s not perfect  because we have to contend with clouds and some showers for Thursday  But  overall  this is a great week of weather Yesterday was another cool day for July with highs in the 70s  Boston  with the wind off the water  was in the 60s much of the evening making for a very comfortable sleeping night Now the humidity is higher and will creep up even more throughout the day  The amount of moisture in the air will peak on Wednesday afternoon and evening making for an uncomfortable few hours on that day I believe both today and Wednesday will be terrific beach days  High tides will be during the middle of the morning  but they are not particularly high for the time of year A cold front brings showers and storms later Wednesday night and Thursday  This front will usher in drier and somewhat cooler air for the end of the week and the weekend  I expect most areas to see a tenth to a quarter inch of rain  not a lot  but a bit to wet the ground and keep the lawns from burning out too much I looked ahead to the weather after this weekend  and I see a few more chances of showers in the next 10 days but no signs of any extended heat Tuesday  Any early fog gives way to sunshine and warm temperatures  More humidity with highs in the upper 80s but remaining in the 70s on the outer portions of Cape Cod and the Islands Tuesday night  Some late night fog  Otherwise partly cloudy and mild  Lows of 65 to 70 Wednesday  Mostly sunny and hot  Highs in the upper 80s to around 90 Wednesday night  Warm and muggy with showers and storms late at night  Lows in the upper 60s Thursday  Showers  mostly in the morning  Some late day clearing  Not as warm with highs of 75 to 80 Thursday night  Clearing and turning drier by morning  Lows in the lower 60s Friday  Mostly sunny with a high in the upper 70s to near 80 Saturday  Sunny with a high in the lower 80s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
98,The warm pattern of last week is certainly over  Today  with a wind off the water  coastal areas will only reach the lower 70s  This time of year the sun is still quite strong  so if you are in the sunshine it will feel warmer than the air temperature shows  There is no chance of rain  although sunshine will mix with clouds at times Overnight a weather system will graze the area  This  combined with the east wind will bring some thicker clouds and the chance for some drizzle  especially along the coast  I am not expecting any significant rainfall and  actually  it likely won’t even be measurable for most of us  It’s very dry right now  and we need a good soaking Tomorrow starts a bit murky along the coastline but sunshine returns for a rather pleasant early to mid September day  Temperatures will be in the 60s by mid morning and the lower 70s during the afternoon A front moves into the region on Thursday and brings the chance of rain showers  There will be more humidity in the air and the possibility of thunder in the evening Friday sees a return to nice weather with highs in the mid 70s I am going to play the weekend mainly dry and with a blend of clouds and sunshine right now  There will be a storm system riding along the same front that goes through Thursday  It appears the storm will remain far enough offshore to not bring any rain to the area  However  just like in winter  if the storm tracks closer to the coast we will see a change in the forecast and need to add more rain Behind this weather system it turns cool and dry  and it’s going to feel more like early October later this weekend and the first part of next week  Have a great day Tuesday  Mostly sunny with highs in the lower 70s along the coast and the mid 70s inland  Thicker clouds on Cape Cod and the Islands Tuesday night  Lots of clouds with some coastal drizzle  Lows in the 50s Wednesday  Early clouds and some drizzle along the shore  Otherwise becoming partly sunny and seasonably cool  Highs of 70 to 75 Thursday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Milder highs in the mid to upper 70s  A few afternoon showers are possible Friday  Partly sunny with highs in the mid 70s Saturday  Lots of clouds with some sun and a risk of a shower  Highs of 68 to 74 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
99,Like yesterday  most of the today will be dry Morning commuters may run into a few icy spots on smaller roads  sidewalks and driveways  Check your traction underfoot this morning before you rush off Skies will be mainly cloudy with a few breakthroughs of sunshine peeking out behind the clouds throughout the day Any snow or rain showers today will be light  Some areas  mostly north of Boston  may see a light coating on the ground  but that s unlikely to be seen in the city Tomorrow is a similar day  where the risk of a light snow or rain shower persists  There will be a bit more sunshine  however  Tuesday s nor easter won t finally relax its grip until Sunday  when risk of precipitation is likely to drop off Once we do get back to the sunshine  temperatures will remain seasonable in the lower 40s  and the upcoming week looks mostly dry High pressure will build into the area later this weekend and keep New England storm free for the foreseeable future  Have a great weekend 
100,A dramatic change in the weather yesterday ushered in cool and damp marine air with scattered showers and even a few thunderstorms  The cool and raw weather conditions remain in place today with an unseasonably cold day more like early April rather than the end of May  Highs today will reach the 50s  but  with the clouds and scattered showers  it will feel quite raw  This cool weather continues overnight with temperatures falling back into the 40s  I expect some colder locations to see the upper 30s Thursday morning  but frost should not be an issue Tomorrow  although the day will start very cool  it will be milder with an abundance of sunshine  Highs Thursday reach the 60s and since the sun is so strong this time of year  as strong as it gets   it will seem warmer Another weather system approaches for Friday with more clouds and the renewed chance of rain showers  I think the bulk of the day is dry however  The threat of wet weather remains Friday night and Saturday  It won’t be a washout at all  but not picture perfect  A drying trend comes in for Sunday with seasonable temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s Although other parts of the country have seen some early heat and humidity  here in New England we are still waiting for a string of very warm days and right now I don’t see a pattern change for a while Wednesday  Cloudy and cool  A few showers but mostly dry with highs of 52 to 56 Overnight  Partly cloudy and cool with a low of 40 to 46 Thursday  Sunny with a high in the mid 60s Friday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A shower or two in the afternoon  Highs of 65 to 70 Saturday  Sunshine followed by building clouds and a chance of a shower  Highs of 63 to 68 Sunday  Mostly sunny with a high near 70 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
101,A blocked pattern of weather left much of southern New England cloudy  cool and wet this weekend  Today that pattern relaxes its grip somewhat with more in the way of sunshine   There will be some clouds  but it’s going to be a much better day than we have seen in several days  Temperatures will be seasonable  mostly in the mid and upper 50s A cool flow off the water will bring a rather chilly day to the region tomorrow  There won’t be any rain  but temperatures will be as much as 10 degrees cooler than today  and with the wind coming off the water it will feel raw and damp by the close of the day  Although some sunshine will be around early tomorrow  the trend is for increasing clouds as we get ready for a mid week rain event Wednesday into Thursday rain will overspread the region  The timing of the rain isn’t exactly known right now  but the morning and evening commutes on Wednesday and the morning commute on Thursday are the most likely ones to be wet  The rain will be heavy at times during this storm with 1 to 3 inches of rain bringing street and small streams some flooding   The rain will end Thursday and a return to sunshine and milder air is in the forecast for Friday   Next weekend is looking mostly dry at the present time Monday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Highs of 55 to 59 Monday night  Cloudy and cool  A brisk wind  Lows of 38 to 43 Tuesday  Some morning sunshine then clouds increase  Highs of 45 to 50 Tuesday night  A cool and raw day with a shower or drizzle late at night  Lows near 40 Wednesday  A few showers possible and lots of clouds  Highs around 50 Thursday  Rain ending and not as cool  Highs near 60 Friday  Partly sunny and seasonable  Highs of 61 to 65 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
102,A big change in the weather Wednesday as we will see much lower humidity  A cold front passed offshore earlier and now drier air is working into the region  Winds will be brisk Wednesday morning and early afternoon as the new air mass becomes established across the area Temperatures are still going to be running on the warm side reaching well into the 80s  These temperatures are running about 10 degrees above the average high for the date  but are still far away from any records for this time of year which are still in the 90s A more comfortable night ahead allows us to open the windows again and enjoy some refreshing air  Lows Thursday morning will be in the upper 50s  a marked change from the near 70 degree nights of the recent past Thursday  like Wednesday will feature a lot of sunshine and warm temperatures also in the mid 80s  It will be be a bit cooler over Cape Cod  but still a great beach day Friday is a hot and increasingly humid day  Highs will once again approach 90 and with the added moisture it will be a very summery day Sleeping without air conditioning will be difficult Friday night as temperatures remain quite high all night not falling much below 70 with a lot of mugginess to the air A cold front approaches Saturday and will finally bring an end to this summer like week  A blend of clouds and sunshine  high levels of humidity and very warm readings make Saturday the last of the truly summery days for a while  Expect some showers and storms in the afternoon  which will form ahead of the next air mass  By Sunday the humidity is lower and highs won t reach the 80s for the first time in a week Enjoy this summer stretch  it won t last forever  Today   Sunny and warm  It will be much drier with highs in the mid 80s  Tonight   Clear and more comfortable with lows in the 50s to near 60  Thursday   Sunny and warm  but still comfortable levels of humidity with highs in the mid 80s  Friday   Sunny hot and becoming more humid with highs 85 to 90  Saturday   A blend of clouds and sunshine  There will be a humid afternoon and evening showers and storms with highs in the mid 80s  Sunday   A blend of clouds and sunshine with much cooler and drier air  Expect highs to be in the lower to mid 70s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
103,A cold start to our Monday sees some spots in the 30s  but most are in the 40s  The good news is there will be a lot of sunshine today and temperatures will recover nicely by 10 or 11 a m  I expect highs to be in the mid 60s this afternoon — a great one to take lunch outside As the high moves east a southerly flow of air will keep it milder and a bit cloudier tonight  Lows will be in the 50s  I am not expecting much in the way of showers tomorrow morning  but there will be a lot of clouds  As the morning turns to afternoon the risk of showers increases and there could even be a rumble of thunder Highs tomorrow will be above average for a change reaching the lower 70s  Since there won’t be much sunshine  it won’t feel that mild  At least we won’t have to worry about solar glare The chance of showers continues into early Wednesday  I am not expecting much in the way of rain  but just enough to wet roads and perhaps create a few puddles Thursday sees a return to sunshine and cooler temperatures  Highs will be in the lower 60s  The sunshine is short lived  however  as another system passes to our south Friday  I’ll forecast a lot of clouds and the risk of showers over Cape Cod  but this forecast is likely going to change a few times this week Provided this system exits the area our weekend will be dry and cool  If the system lingers or moves further north then we could see a wetter and cloudier weekend  It’s important to check the forecast throughout the week for the Columbus Day weekend Have a great day Monday  Sunny and seasonable with highs in the mid 60s Monday night  A few clouds  Otherwise patchy fog by morning  Not as cool with lows of 50 to 55 Tuesday  Lots of clouds and milder  A few showers or even a thunderstorm in the afternoon Wednesday  A morning shower — otherwise a blend of clouds and sunshine  Highs around 70 Thursday  Sunny with a high in the low 60s Friday  Mostly cloudy with highs in the lower 60s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
104,Another mild day for today as sunshine mixes with clouds  Temperatures will reach near 70 in many spots  but stay in the 50s thanks to the wind off the water over much of Cape Cod and the Islands  The closer to the canal you live  the milder it will be this afternoon Showers are back in the forecast overnight as a cold front slips through  The showers will be numerous  but I am not expecting a large amount of rain because the showers won’t last for very long  There could be the rumble of thunder with the passage of the cold front Wednesday still looks unsettled  especially the first part of the day with the chance for showers remaining in the forecast east of Route 495 during the morning  In the afternoon  some clearing will take place from west to east  but overall it’s not a great day of weather Thursday is bright but blustery as a storm well to our east in Canada drags in some colder air   Highs will only be in the 50s and with the strong winds it will feel cooler Friday is a great day with sunshine  less wind and temperatures near 60  The weekend looks good to start  but the atmosphere is about to undergo a  bit of a transition  These spring transitions can bring clouds  drizzle and cool readings to the area  I’ll be updating more on the Sunday forecast tomorrow Tuesday  Partly sunny with highs of 65 to 70  Cooler in the 50s over the mid and outer parts of Cape Cod Tuesday night  Showers and the rumble of thunder possible  Lows in the 40s Wednesday  Mostly cloudy with morning showers possible  Highs in the 50s Thursday  Sunny with a gusty wind Friday  Mostly sunny and pleasant  Highs around 60 Weekend  Some clouds and seasonable You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
105,Sunshine will be most abundant this morning before cooler marine air moves in for the afternoon with scattered showers  Temperatures today will be highly dependent on your exact location  This afternoon a cold front will move south along the coast from Maine and bring a period of showers along with a drop in temperatures The cool air will first enter Massachusetts around Rockport  Ipswich and Salisbury then push south and west through the rest of area during the afternoon and early evening  The later the front passes  the warmer readings will be before the cool air arrives There will be showers with the front and the evening commute will likely be wet in many places  Tomorrow will be a cool and damp day with a raw wind off the ocean  Highs will likely remain in the 50s as ocean water is still quite cold On Thursday  high pressure briefly builds into the area for a nice day  but showers return for Friday and the start of the weekend and the final day of May  If the system bringing the showers moves quickly  we should see a return to sunshine on Sunday Tuesday  Partly sunny in the morning with more clouds and a chance of showers in the afternoon  Highs around 70 but cooler at the coast  All areas will see readings fall late in the afternoon Tuesday night  A period of showers in the evening and then cooler and damp  Lows of 48 to 52 Wednesday  Raw and much cooler  Some drizzle or morning showers  Highs in the 50s Thursday  Sunny and not as chilly  Highs of 65 to 70 Friday  A chance of showers with lots of clouds  Highs in the 60s Saturday  Cloudy with some sunny breaks  A shower possible  highs in the mid to upper 60s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
106,A dry start to the morning will be accompanied by an increase in clouds throughout the day  It’s opening day at Fenway Park and even if you aren’t fortunate enough to attend the game  spring is in the air Temperatures today will feel more like football season weather rather than baseball season weather  Around 2 p m  this afternoon temperatures will be in the lower 40s  not very conducive for the  Boys of Summer   but certainly a more typical early April day There are showers in the forecast  but they should hold off until after dark tonight  Most of the rain activity will likely occur after midnight as a weather system crosses the region Any rain will end quite early Saturday  and I expect clearing to take place during the morning  leaving us with a nice afternoon  While it will be raw and chilly today  it will be mild Saturday  Highs over the weekend will reach the 50s to near 60 degrees Sunday is a breezy and dry day with an abundance of sunshine  Temperatures once again will be in the 50s with a few spots nearing 60 degrees for an hour or two in the afternoon Our next chance of rain arrives Monday night  This looks to bring a healthy dose of rain with a half to one inch of rainfall  Tuesday may start wet  but the trend will be for drier air to take over during the day Today  Some sunny breaks with clouds increasing  Raw and chilly with highs in teh lower and middle 40s  Warmest away from the coast Tonight  A period of showers or steady rain late at night  ending toward dawn  Lows 38 44 degrees Saturday  Early clouds then clearing and breezy  Milder in the afternoon  Highs 55 60 Saturday night  Mostly clear and chilly  Lows in the 30s Sunday  Lots of sunshine  Highs 53 58 Monday  Morning sunshine then increasing clouds  Highs 55 60 Tuesday  A chance of rain early  then clearing late in the day  Highs in the 50s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
107,Wednesday s rainfall was much needed  as lawns  gardens and woods were starting to dry out  We saw a wet and rainy day with most areas receiving 1 3 inches of rain and some areas exceeding 4 inches Now we return to our wonderful stretch of summer weather which seemingly has been going on for quite a while  High pressure is going to build into the mid Atlantic region and protect our area from any significant rain for a while  There will be clouds in the sky the next couple of afternoons  but not so many that we see any showers The weekend is looking rather nice  I would pick Saturday as the better of the two weekend days  but only because there is a slight risk of a shower or thunderstorm on Sunday  That day isn’t a washout and certainly nothing like the weather we saw the past 24 hours Temperatures are going to be quite typical for the second half of August with highs in the mid to upper 70s  The best chance to reach or exceed 80 degrees is on Saturday  and temperatures will be a degree or two cooler Sunday  with more clouds The next chance for significant rain comes sometime between Tuesday night and Wednesday   More on that in the coming days as the timing and strength of that system is still very much in question Thursday  Sunny with a high in the mid 70s Thursday Night  Passing clouds and comfortable  Lows between 55 60 degrees Friday  Lots of sunshine  Highs in the mid 70s Saturday  Sunshine and a few clouds  Highs nearing 80 degrees Sunday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A few scattered showers  Highs 76 81 Monday  Mostly sunny with highs in the upper 70s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
108,A slow moving  coastal storm will bring a slug of rain and wind to the region today and tonight  The rain will amount to 1 to 3 inches with street flooding possible  The bulk of the storm will be over by Wednesday morning  but clouds and the risk of rain and snow showers will linger into Thursday This is a typical warm nor easter where enough mild air comes in off the ocean to avoid any major issues with snow or ice  That said  we do have some frozen precipitation inland this morning and there will be some light accumulation of snow and sleet  Areas well north and west of Route 495 could see 1 to 3 inches of snow  but it s all going to be washed away by the heavy rain this afternoon The heaviest rain will move in during the afternoon making it a difficult commute Temperatures will reach the lower 50s over Cape Cod  but only around 40 in the far northwest corner of Worcester County Winds and coastal beach erosion will be an issue along the coast  especially east facing beaches and areas on Cape Ann and Cape Cod  Winds might reach 50 miles per hour or higher later today and the first part of the night causing scattered power outages The storm will linger in the area for a couple of days  but in a weakened state  This means clouds and the chance of showers of rain or snow Better weather arrives Friday with a lot of clouds and seasonable temperatures  After this storm  we have a lull in the action and no wintry cold or snow for a while Tuesday  Any early snow and sleet changes to rain  The rain could be heavy at times  Urban street flooding possible in places  Gusty winds with highs in the 40s Tuesday night  Showers and perhaps a thunderstorm  Some downpours possible  Lows of 40 to 45 Wednesday  Lots of clouds with a risk of a shower or two  Highs in the mid 40s Thursday  A snow or rain shower  Highs in the 40s Friday  Mostly cloudy with a high near 40 Saturday  Partly sunny with a high in the lower 40s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
109,An area of rain missed most of the region last night  This opportunity is now gone  and we have more dry weather on the way for perhaps as much as another week If you are going to be outside Friday it’s more important than usual to be careful with any flames or cigarettes  The ground is exceedingly dry as most of the region sees its driest September in decades  The warm weather of the upcoming weekend while welcome will exacerbate the drought High pressure will move into a position that will allow a southwest flow of air to pull temperature in the 80 degree range or higher both Saturday and Sunday  These highs are the reason we can’t seem to get any significant rain  They just keep the rain areas from moving far enough north to bring precipitation to the region Our drought has now entered a new phase and is now being called  moderate  for parts of the region as it expands northwest  If this pattern continues into October without significant rain  we are going to see conditions worsen in spite of the growing season ending Plenty of sunshine will come through all weekend  and I highly recommend taking advantage of the nice weather  Even if we don’t see rain soon  warm 80 degree days are numbered  The nights are going to be comfortably cool for sleeping  but not so cool it won’t be possible to have a meal outside to take advantage of dining on the many restaurant patios in the region before they close up for the season Monday brings a slightly cooler day  but still unseasonably warm with more sunshine  It’s beginning to feel a lot like sunny California around here  Have a great weekend Friday  Sunny  highs in the lower 70s Friday night  Clear  with a low around 50 Saturday  Lots of sunshine and warm   Highs around 80 Sunday  Sunny and unseasaonbly warm  Highs in the lower 80s Monday  Mostly sunny  with a high in the mid 70s Tuesday  Lots of clouds highs in the mid 60s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
110,Rain is the forecast through tomorrow evening  but the steadiest rain and heaviest rain will fall today through early tomorrow  Temperatures will continue to be unseasonably cool with highs in the lower and mid 40s today Some of the rain could be quite heavy  especially west of Boston this morning  The trend will be for a steadier rain today so the evening commute looks like a very wet one  and the Red Sox game is likely to be postponed Early Thursday morning the rain will still be heavy but then become more showery in nature during the day  At times it will be breezy and just cloudy and then a few moments later there might be a round of heavy downpours and showers  I expect the shower activity to be numerous tomorrow Temperatures on Thursday will be significantly warmer and it will be somewhat humid  In contrast to the ocean chill much of this week it will feel rather summer like Friday is still looking like a nice day with an abundance of sunshine and breezy conditions   Highs will reach the 60s  The weekend also looks mostly on the dry side with a mix of clouds and sunshine  A shower is possible Sunday  but not a steady rain and it will be typically mild with highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s during the weekend Wednesday  Periods of rain and very cool with highs in the low to mid 40s Wednesday night  More rain  could be heavy at times with patchy fog  Temperatures in the 40s rising to the lower 50s by morning Thursday  Heavy rain early  then clouds  breezy and much milder with scattered showers and thunderstorm  Some storms could be strong  Highs in the mid 60s to near 70 Friday  Lots of sunshine and breezy  Highs in the mid to upper 60s Saturday  Partly sunny with a high of 61 to 66 Sunday  A mix of clouds and sunshine  A quick shower possible  Highs of 59 to 64 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

112,Another wonderful day across the area with abundant sunshine and warm temperatures   Highs reach the 70s this afternoon  but along the coast an east wind keeps readings in the 60s  The air will be dry as humidity levels continue to be low  There is an area of showers over Pennsylvania this morning  but it will take its time moving east Showers are indeed in the forecast for Thursday and Friday  but most of the activity will not affect eastern New England  When the rain has finally ended sometime Friday areas around Boston might not have even seen a quarter of an inch of water  In other words  while showers are certainly going to be around  the next two days are not a washout The holiday weekend won’t be perfect  but it will be pretty good  I am expecting a mix of clouds and sunshine for Saturday with an outside chance of a shower  Sunday also has some clouds with sunshine  but the chance of rain is low  Monday is likely the best day of the holiday weekend with mostly sunny skies and warm air  Highs could reach near 80 over interior areas while certainly making into the 70s along the coast  Cape Cod will be a bit cooler as usual Wednesday  Mostly sunny with a high of 71 to 77  65 to 70 along the coast  Wednesday night  Becoming cloudy and cool  Lows in the lower 50s Thursday  Cloudy and much cooler  Highs of 57 to 62  A few showers possible Friday  Mostly cloudy with a chance of a shower or two  Highs of 60 to 65 Saturday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A slight risk of a shower  Highs in the 60s Sunday  Partly sunny and mild  Highs of 67 to 74 Memorial Day  Mostly sunny with a high near 75 to 80  Cooler at the beaches Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

118,A cool  but nice day is underway across New England as high pressure continues to keep any rain to the south of the region   There is some rain not too far away so there will be some clouds around  but it’s going to be a dry day   As winds come off the cooler Atlantic  highs will be only in the lower 70s along the coast  but reach the mid 70s inland Overnight clouds will dominate  blocking out the moon  which was full a few nights ago   Temperature will fall to the comfortable range in the upper 50s to lower 60s Thursday brings some sunshine mixed with clouds  The day will be dry  yet there will be a line of showers developing in the afternoon and evening   Overnight showers could be heavy in a few places  but like so much of the rain the past 6 weeks  not everyone will see it  You will notice more humidity in the air on Thursday and with highs near 80 it’s another one of those summer feeling afternoons The frontal system causing the showers will pass off the coast Thursday night  but not too far off the coast  Friday will be sunny and cooler  but there will be an area of clouds and showers developing along the front  The question for the weekend is whether or not the showers move up the coastline close enough to bring some rain to the area  Right now  it appears most of the showers will stay far enough off the coast  but this will need to be watched the next couple of days Sunday will bring a return to cool and dry conditions with a fall feel to the air as temperatures stay in the upper 60s to lower 70s during the afternoon Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

120,I ll start this morning with a quote from the folks at the National Weather Service in Boston about the weather this week   Not the most summer like pattern   I couldn t have said it any better  so why try It s not that the weather the next few days is going to be bad  it s just I m sure most of us don t expect such pleasant temperatures and low humidity in the middle of August  It s almost hard to fathom what time of year it is  It s sort of like having a very mild February High pressure will remain in control through Wednesday keeping any significant cloud and rain to our south  High temperatures will be in the 70s this week and overnight lows will fall into the 50s  Boston  Providence and Hartford will likely remain in the lower 60s at night due to the buildings  etc The second half of the week will bring a new round of possible showers but here  too  this doesn t look like a washout  The best chance of rain seems to be Thursday  but that chance might linger into Friday  The upcoming weekend looks dry and pleasant  I still don t see any big heat in sight  This might be a summer with no heat waves  Time will tell Monday  Mostly sunny and pleasant with highs in the mid 70s Monday night  Mostly clear and comfortable  Lows in the mid 50s to lower 60s  warmest in the cities and right along the water  Tuesday  Sunny and pleasant  Highs in the mid 70s Wednesday  Mostly sunny and seasonable  Highs in the upper 70s  cooler at the coast  Thursday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A few showers possible  Somewhat more humid with highs in the 70s Friday  Partly sunny with a high in the mid 70s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

132,A cool and cloudy day — something the area hasn t seen in a while — is in store for Thursday  There is a chance of showers from roughly the Massachusetts Turnpike south this afternoon with a steadier rain likely to fall over Cape Cod  The rain shield won’t push very far north and those towns along the border of New Hampshire might not see even a sprinkle The storm responsible for the chance of rain is moving out to sea south of New England  The rain shield will move north Thursday afternoon before pivoting away this evening  It still appears southern areas will see rain  but if the storm tracks further south  Cape Cod might not see many hours of steady rainfall Clearing takes place later Thursday evening  and our amazing weekend of weather is still going to happen  In spite of the fact we aren’t going to see the much needed rain  we might as well enjoy summer like weekend in early fall Highs this weekend will reach the 80 or a bit higher in many spots while remaining in the mid 70s over Cape Cod and lower 70s on Nantucket  Sunshine will be the dominate weather feature all weekend  and although it will get warm during the day  it will cool off nicely at night for great sleeping conditions The dry and sunny pattern keeps on truckin’ into next week as Monday also looks sunny  Highs will be somewhat cooler and not reaching 80  but it’s still going to be a great day for being outside at lunch or taking a late afternoon run Let’s hope I am wrong about today’s rain shield and it moves further north  because that’s the only shot at rain for many more days  Have a great Thursday Thursday  Cloudy and cool  A few showers later in the afternoon with a steadier rain over Cape Cod  Highs 61 66 Thursday night  Any showers end in the evening hours  Lows 50 55 Friday  Mostly sunny with highs in the lower 70s Saturday  Sunny and warm with a high near 80 Sunday  Sunny and warm again  Highs 78 82 Monday  Mostly sunny with a high in the mid 70s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
133,Rain is expected to fall this weekend  However  the worst of it will fall between midnight tonight and 10 a m  Saturday  Another chance of showers could strike after 4 p m  Sunday  but otherwise  weekend outdoor activities outside these windows should go off without a hitch Muggy air will continue today and early Saturday  but without much heat  the humidity isn t hard to bear  Temperature highs this afternoon and Saturday will be within a few degrees of 70  with a slight five  or six degree dip Sunday A slow moving cold front is stuck west of the city and is the cause of the rainfall  As this front finally pushes off the coast Saturday morning  the showers will end  Behind the front  cooler and somewhat unsettled weather will be with us for the first few days of the week  While showers are in the forecast through Tuesday  most of days are looking dry Today  Lots of clouds  A shower is possible late morning or early afternoon  Highs in the upper 60s to lower 70s Tonight  Cloudy this evening  then a period of rain  Breezy  Lows in the upper 50s to lower 60s Saturday  Rain ending in the morning  the some clearing  Highs around 70 Sunday  Partly sunny with showers possible late in the day  Highs in the mid 60s Monday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A pop up shower Tuesday  A mix of clouds and sunshine  Afternoon showers in some areas  Highs 61 66 degrees Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
134,A slow moving air mass of much drier air will take two more days to get here  Until then  very humid and unsettled weather continues  It s not going to rain all day today — as a matter of fact  there will be more dry hours than wet ones  There could be some breaks of sunshine as well  which will only serve to heat the air and make it more likely we see afternoon showers and storms The risk of heavy rain is high enough that we have flash flood watches up for most areas through tomorrow afternoon  Some areas could see 4 inches of rain or more  I can t tell you exactly which towns get the heaviest rain  but those that do could see street flooding and small streams reach flood stage  These types of patterns inevitably will produce some notable rainfall and it wouldn t surprise me if we see some road washed out because of all the possible water The best chance for the heavy rain is between 3 p m  this afternoon and the middle of the day Wednesday  There can be showers earlier today and a few later in the day Wednesday  but the other times are the most likely for the torrential stuff Eventually  the cold front will push east and you will notice the air begin to turn much drier  It s still going to be warm and we won t see any of that chilly July air now in the Midwest  The weekend starts with a lot of sunshine  but during Sunday there will be more in the way of clouds  but it s still going to be nice day  Our next chance of showers is Monday  but it doesn t appear to be as high a risk we have today Tuesday  Flood watches posted  Warm and muggy with a few showers possible into the early part of the afternoon  but more likely in the late afternoon  Highs in the lower 80s Tuesday night  Scattered showers and thunderstorms  especially early at night  Muggy with lows around 70 Wednesday  Scattered showers and thunderstorms  Some could contain heavy downpours Thursday  Mostly sunny and pleasant with highs of 77 to 83 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high in the low 80s Saturday  Mostly sunny with highs in the lower 80s Sunday  A blend of clouds and sunshine with highs of 80 to 85 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
135,The weather remains unsettled the next several days as multiple weather systems affect the region  Friday is a dry  chilly day  Highs this afternoon will reach the mid 30s to near 40 — below the long term average As a warm front moves towards the region overnight  clouds could yield a bit of rain or snow  There could be some light accumulation of snow and sleet far west of the coastal plain  but not a big deal  The map shows the areas that could see some snow before the mild air eventually wins out If you are traveling Friday evening west of Route 495  you might end up hitting some slick roads  especially secondary roadways On Saturday  a storm will pass off the coast south of New England  bringing with it another period of rain  This rain will be steadiest in the middle part of the day and into the evening  Temperatures will rise well into the 40s to near 50 A break in the action comes Sunday with clearing skies and cold air  Highs will only be in the 30s once again  Monday is dry and chilly The models have been indicating the possibility of a coastal storm for Tuesday  but nothing is written in stone  Since the potential storm is four days away we have plenty of time to better understand how the atmosphere will unfold and if the storm does indeed hit New England or pass safely out to sea Friday  Partly sunny and cold  Highs 35 40 Friday night  A chance of snow and sleet early in the evening  then periods of rain  Temperatures around freezing and then rising late at night Saturday  More periods of rain  Highs in the 40s Sunday  Early clouds then clearing  Highs in the 30s Monday  Partly sunny with highs in the mid 30s Tuesday  Chance of coastal shower and mixed precipitation well inland  Highs 38 43 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

138,A great day of weather is on tap Wednesday with a blend of clouds an sunshine and mild air  A flow of air from the southwest will help boost temperatures above seasonal averages We won’t see any record warmth  however  The record for Nov  5 was set 20 years ago  when temperatures reached a very warm 79 degress  It s still a great day to get outside and enjoy the tranquil weather as cooler weather is on its way again Thursday will start cloudy  though I expect commuters will make it through the morning without any wetness  As a cold front crosses the region  a storm will develop on the front and pass through the region overnight Thursday  This system will then move northeast and beyond our area The rain will end on Friday morning  It appears the Thursday evening commute will be quite wet and with the early darkness it will likely be a slower ride home than the normally slow ride Friday morning could see a few showers  but the trend will be for the rain to end and for there to be just cloudy skies most of the day  It’s going to be cooler with all the clouds and more of a Canadian air mass in place The weekend is looking challenging for forecasters  Saturday looks to be sunny and cool with highs in the mid 40s during the afternoon  If you are headed to a local athletic event be sure to dress warmly Sunday sees a bit of sun in the morning  but clouds will overtake the skies and depending on the evolution of a new storm  we could be looking at more rain later in the day  I’ll have nore on this tomorrow  There’s also a possibility of no precipitation at all Wednesday  Mild with a blend of clouds and sunshine  Breezy with a high in the mid 60s Wednesday night  Mostly cloudy and mild lows in the mid 40s Thursday  Cloudy early  then rain overspreading the area late in the morning  Highs in the mid 50s Friday  Early showers  then cloudy  Some late breaks possible  Highs in the upper 40s to lower 50s Saturday  Sunny and chilly  Highs in the mid 40s Sunday  Lots of clouds with a chance of afternoon showers  Highs around 50 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
139,After many areas saw the ground turn white for a few hours yesterday on the back of a strong nor easter  today brings back the sunshine but continues with the cold air  Winds will be brisk this morning so if you are outside waiting for a bus or the T  bundle up  Wind chills will be running in the 20s at times with the wind Highs this afternoon will make it into the 40s — below average for this time in November  Clear moonlit skies come overnight tonight with lows just above or below the freezing mark  Wind won t be an issue tonight as it was last evening Milder air streams into the northeast for Tuesday and Wednesday  Each of these days looks great with Tuesday seeing sunshine and highs in the upper 50s  It will be even warmer on Wednesday as highs reach the mid 60s A cold front brings a round of showers on Thursday afternoon  This front may stall off the coast and act as a focal point for another nor easter moving up the coastline on Friday  It appears it will be warm enough we don t have to worry about snow  but there could be more signficant rain with this system depending on the exact track Sunshine and cooler air returns for the start of the upcoming weekend Monday  Sunny with a gusty wind  especially this morning  Highs of 45 to 50 Monday night  Mostly clear with a low of 31 to 36 Tuesday  Mostly sunny with a high of 55 to 60 Wednesday  Mild with a blend of clouds and sunshine  Highs in the mid 60s Thursday  Periods of rain late in the morning or early afternoon  Highs in the upper 50s Friday  Rain likely  Highs in the mid to upper 50s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

141,After a nearly flawless Veterans Day our weather continues to be mild  but clouds are back in the forecast  Early fog and even some drizzle will be an issue in some spots  but for most Wednesday is just a cloudier day than we have seen this week Temperatures are still going to be running mild with highs in the upper 50s along the coast and lower to even middle 60s well inland  This mild air means another chance to do some outdoor chores if you are off today  Unfortunately  the days are so short it s hard to get anything accomplished after work  because it s already dark There is a cold front slowly moving east  By the weekend  we will have a small taste of the cold air the western part of the country has been seeing  Any snow is going to stay far from the area for now A weak system might bring a shower or flurry early Friday  but generally it s a dry day with sunshine   The weekend looks chilly to start with some modification in the air on Sunday ahead of the next weather maker  Some rain is likely sometime Sunday night or early Monday before we get back to the sunshine   Colder air returns for the middle of next week and this might be accompanied by some storminess sometime late in the 10 day period ahead Wednesday  Early fog and spotty drizzle otherwise mostly cloudy and mild  Highs in the mid 60s inland and upper 50s at the coast Thursday  Mostly sunny  with a high 45 50 Friday  A light morning shower or flurry otherwise becoming mostly sunny  Highs in the 40s Saturday  Sunny  with a high near 40 Sunday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Some rain at night possible  Highs in the lower 40s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
142,It’s another clear and cool morning to start the work week after a pretty great weekend of weather  The fine stretch is going to continue for another week with only a brief break in the sunshine  High pressure is going to slip off the coast today and allow for a slow return of humidity and warmer temperatures  We haven’t been in the 80s for several days and most inland areas will approach or just exceed that mark this afternoon A light east wind off the water will keep the beaches cooler  but it won’t penetrate very far inland  Humidity remains quite low and unnoticeable for the most part Tomorrow  with a stronger breeze from the south  humidity will return along with a few more clouds later in the day  The humidity will help keep temperatures quite mild Tuesday night and you might have to put the air conditioning on although that breeze will help move the air around Wednesday a cold front moves into the region and increases the chance of showers during the day  It’s not until evening that showers are likely  but the risk goes up after noon  It will be quite humid before the front passes overnight and early Thursday If the front keeps on moving along the skies will clear and the end of the week then features a return to dry and cooler conditions  However  there is the chance the front gets stuck close to us allowing those showers and unsettled weather to linger  I’ll play it more positive for now  but the forecast could chance quite a bit over the next couple of days Monday  Sunny and warm with highs of 75 to 83  Warmest inland and coolest on the Cape Islands Monday night  Mostly clear with a low of 52 to 62 Tuesday  Mostly sunny and warmer  More humidity in the afternoon  Highs in the lower 80s  70s on the Cape Islands  Wednesday  A slight chance of showers early in the day and a better chance of showers to end the day  Warm and humid with highs of 78 to 84  There will be some sunshine mixed with clouds during the dry periods Thursday  Any early showers end followed by increasing sunshine  Highs in the upper 70s  Les humid Friday  Mostly sunny and pleasant with highs of 75 to 78 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
143,Weekends are the best part of summer  as they bring about the chance to enjoy the warm and hopefully dry weather It is difficult to get a rainy day in July and early August is similar  The heart of summer just isn t normally the time of year when storms bring a day of rain This summer is different  however  We ve had a few days of rain this month including  of course  the memorable Fourth of July tropical system  The good news is these rainy days have not occurred on the weekend The bad news is  I feel like our lucky streak is about to run out  The flow in the upper levels of the atmosphere is going to be amplified enough to span a small storm along the coastline this weekend  As the system moves north  it will bring a period of rain showers to parts of the area  The most likely areas to have little or no sun will be south of Boston  The further south and closer to the coast you are  the better chance you have of getting caught in the rain If you are looking for sunshine  you might have to go into western Maine this weekend  But  even in that area  there is a chance of showers  There is a stronger likelihood of rain and cool temperatures in the Cape Cod region The weather could still change  It s only Wednesday and systems predicted four days in advance can vary enough to impact the forecast  It s unlikely to be a sunny  dry warm weekend  but it s not written in stone who will have a washout We do see improvements next week  and there might be some heat in the extended outlook sometime about a week from now Wednesday  Sunny with a high in the upper 70s Wednesday night  Partly cloudy and comfortably cool  Lows in the upper 50s to lower 60s Thursday  Lots of sunshine and warm with highs in the lower 80s Friday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  highs in the lower 80s  There is the chance of a thunderstorm in the afternoon  It will be a bit more humid Saturday  Cloudy to the west  with a chance of showers in Boston and rain likely further south of the city  Highs in the 70s Sunday  More clouds and a risk of showers  Highs in the 70s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
144,Today is another mild day with highs getting back into the 40s  It s a good idea to get outside for a walk or a run today as the weather starts going downhill for the start of the weekend Temperatures  which have been so mild this week are going to return to cold and eventually bitter cold levels later next week  Without any snow covering the ground  it might be a bit easier to bear Saturday s weather will likely be the worst of the weekend  with a few showers or rain and snow   Across northern Worcester County there could be some light accumulation of snow on the higher hilltops   It won t be a storm worthy of plows  but the light snowfall could whiten the ground and cover the grass Sunday looks to be drier  but colder with highs remaining in the 30s  There will still be a lot of clouds and a stray flurry Monday is a very typical mid January day  The roads will be dry  and there won t be any fog so the commute should only be hampered by car volume  not weather The arctic air returns for Tuesday and the rest of next week  There will likely be a day or two when temperatures don t get out the teens in Boston and lower 20s over Cape Cod  At night  with a strong wind at times  wind chill readings could plummet to 20 below  more on this next week Today  Mostly sunny and comfortably cool today   Highs between 40 to 46 Tonight  Cloudy and cool   Lows 29 to 35 Saturday  Cloudy with a period of rain or snow showers   It won t be damp the entire day  Some light accumulation of snow over northern Worcester County   Highs 32 to 38 Saturday night  Snow showers ending and turning colder   Lows 23 to 29 Sunday   Partly cloudy  Lows 21 to 28 Monday  Mostly sunny  with a highs in the mid 30s  except north and west of route 495 where lower 30s will persist Tuesday  Partly sunny and noticeably colder   Highs 21 to 27 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

146,Another typical July week is in store with warm and humid readings and a scattering of afternoon or evening showers the first half of the week  After Thursday  drier and less humid air will move into the area as we head into the upcoming weekend Mid July is typically some of our driest and hottest weather  This year  we haven’t seen a preponderance of 90 degree days  but even in summers without a lot of 90 plus afternoons  it’s still often very humid I expect Boston to hit 90 one or two days this week with Tuesday and Wednesday being the most likely days for this to happen  If we did hit 90 this afternoon and again the two days after that  it would be a heat wave  but this isn’t likely A slow moving cold front will cross southern New England either late Wednesday or Thursday  The timing of this front will determine when we see a return to cooler and drier air  I do expect this upcoming weekend to be more comfortable High pressure is sitting to our south and east this morning  This high will continue a flow of warm and increasingly humid air the first part of this week  A southwest breeze will keep Cape Cod and the Islands as well as towns along the water of the south coast in the mid 70s to mid 80s  The nights this week are going to be quite uncomfortable for sleeping as low temperatures remain near 70 in many spots with the coolest areas still staying in the mid 60s Monday  Some clouds and also periods of sunshine  Warm and more humid  Highs in the mid to upper 80s  cooler on Cape Cod  the Islands and south coast  Monday night  Warm and muggy  Very small chance of an evening shower  Lows of 66 to 71 Tuesday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Breezy and hot with highs of 88 to 92  cooler on Cape Cod  the Islands and south coast   An evening thunderstorm is possible Wednesday  Partly cloudy  hot and humid  A few scattered showers or afternoon storms are possible with highs of 86 to 91 Thursday  Early showers  then sunshine and clouds with highs in the mid 80s Friday  Mostly sunny and drier  Highs in the lower 80s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

149,Weather will be mostly dry over the next several days  but there is a small possibility a few showers will break out The risk of showers is low  especially for three of the next four days  However  a stronger area of energy will cross the region on Sunday and increase the risk of some rainfall Temperatures will be seasonable through the weekend and into next week  Saturday morning will be a bit chilly when you get up  but the mercury will quickly rise after the early sunrise Winds will be a bit brisk this afternoon  but they will not be strong enough to spoil any outdoor plans While Thursday s rain is over  the atmosphere remains in an unsettled mode through the weekend  The disturbances moving through over the next four days are quite weak and while showers may happen  there will be many hours of sunshine as well Friday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A pop up shower is possible  especially later in the afternoon  Highs in the 60s with a bit of a breeze Friday night  Passing clouds  Cool  Lows near 50 in Boston and in the 40s in colder areas Saturday  Lots of sunshine  but there is still a small risk of a shower or storm in the afternoon  Highs 65 69  though cooler on the Cape and the Islands Sunday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A few afternoon showers are likely  Highs in the mid 60s Monday  A mix of clouds and sunshine  A few spots could see a brief shower  but mostly it’s dry  Highs near 60 at the coast but milder inland You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
150,It’s cold again this morning  as the arctic air is firmly entrenched across the region  However  there are some hopeful signs on the horizon Friday is going to be a cold and blustery day  Actual air temperatures are a few degrees less cold than Thursday  It is 6 degrees in Metro West compared to Thursday s 1 degree reading in the same location Overnight tonight will see an increase in clouds and very late at night — as milder air flows into the region — the temperature may actually rise a few degrees off the coldest point You have probably heard word that snow is in the forecast for Saturday  New England will spend much of the day with a southerly flow of air containing more moisture than our dry arctic air of late At the same time  a new push of cold will be heading south and east  As these air masses collide over the region  snow showers and even snow squalls will break out Snow is a possibility at any time between sunrise and 11 p m  Saturday  but it is most likely to snow in the afternoon and early evening I am not expecting another Saturday surprise snow event for two reasons  First  I am putting snow in the forecast and secondly  the situation is totally different atmospherically compared to last weekend  That said  we could see a heavy coating of up to 2 inches of snow from this situation  This means roads can become very slippery and travel impeded in areas receiving the heavier squalls On Sunday  arctic air returns to the region as temperatures stay in the teens to near 20 degrees  Another system brings a few more snow showers Sunday night and early Monday  While Monday will be seasonably cold  the rest of next week stays well below average for late January Today  Sunny  with highs only 12 18  Wind chill values 10 15 below zero at timesTonight  Increasing clouds  with a low around 13 in Boston  but single numbers north and west Saturday  Snow showers and perhaps a snow squall  especially in the afternoon  but possibly all day  Breezy and not cold  Highs 32 40  warmest over Cape Cod where rain showers could fall instead of snow Saturday Night  Snow showers end  Windy and turning colder  Lows 10 18 Sunday  Mostly sunny  with highs 17 22 and low wind chill readings  Gusty winds at times Sunday Night  Clouding up with a snow flurry by morning  lows in the lower teens Monday  A chance of snow showers in the morning  Not as cold  with highs in the 30s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
151,Another nice day in what is turning out to be such a great stretch of weather this summer  While we have seen some clouds build in the afternoon the past few days there hasn t been any widespread rain in a couple of weeks  For those of you on vacation  the good news is  although I do see a wet Wednesday  it s not going to last long Our rain tomorrow is coming thanks to a vigorous storm system which will cross the region  Toward the end of summer  sorry to write that   it s still rather unusual to have a day of rain unless there is a tropical system involved  The rain tomorrow is courtesy of a more winter type of system  When we see a vigorous system like this in summer it can spawn severe weather  The best chance for any thunderstorms from this upcoming storm will be south of Boston As the system moves away from the area on Wednesday night high pressure will move back into the area and sunshine will once again resume for another stretch  At first  it s going to be dry and somewhat cool for the time of year  but as we head through the weekend a warming trend will ensue and temperatures will rise to seasonable or even warmer than seasonable levels I am expecting 1 to 3 inches of rain Wednesday and this will be a big help to the recent dry spell  We aren t in a drought or anything like that  but the woods and the gardens and the lawns could use a good healthy dose of rain and we are about to get it Both the morning and evening commute could be impacted on Wednesday by the rain  The good news is this time of year the overall commute is a bit lighter  but heavy rain can cause issues I still don t see any heat waves in our future  and this may end up being the first summer in several years without one  More on this  of course  in the coming weeks  Have a great day Tuesday  A bit of early fog  then mostly sunny  Clouds will move into the area during the second part of the afternoon from the west and south Tuesday night  Mostly cloudy and turning muggy  Showers develop late at night Wednesday  Periods of rain  becoming breezy inland and windy along the coast  Rain may be heavy at times  Chance of thunderstorms south of Boston  Highs in the lower 70s Thursday  Early clouds  then clearing and drier  Highs of 72 to 76 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 75 Saturday  Sunny with a high in the upper 70s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
152,By the time you read this  the snow is likely winding down or over  Friday s taste of winter isn t a big deal  however  The ground is just still too warm for snow to stick  Soil temperatures were in the 40s yesterday  and so the snow will be melting from the bottom up throughout Friday morning and into the early afternoon I expect a coating of up to 2 inches of snow is the most anyone in the area will see  And  the highest accumulations will be seen on the grassy surfaces of the higher elevations southwest of Boston Sunshine returns Friday afternoon with a brisk breeze  I m not expecting the air to heat up much more than Friday morning  Temperatures will likely only reach the lower 40s  Friday night will be the coldest evening of this fall  with a hard freeze hitting the area Saturday is the brightest day of the weekend with abundant sunshine and light winds  Highs will likely only reach the 38 43 degree range  with the mildest temperatures over Nantucket  Clouds increase after a cold start Sunday  Highs get back into the lower 40s on Sunday with a busy wind in the afternoon Another storm approaches for Sunday night and Monday  and the morning commute Monday does look to be quite wet  This will of course impact the speed of travel  so plan ahead Even colder air comes back for the middle of next week as we get a taste of the arctic air you ve been hearing about in the western part of the country Friday  Snow ending by 9 a m  Look for a coating to an inch that s mostly visible on grass  plants and car tops  Sunshine returns in the afternoon with highs in the lower 40s Friday night  Mostly clear  Cold with lows in the mid 20s to lower 30s Saturday  Sunny with highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s over Cape Cod Sunday  Sunshine followed by increasing clouds  Milder  but breezy  Highs in the lower 40s Monday  Rain or a mix of rain and wet snow early will transform into just rain  Highs in the mid 40s Tuesday  Partly sunny  with a high between 37 41 degrees You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
153,More than an inch of rain fell in the Boston area overnight Wednesday into Thursday  with heavy rains also falling over Cape Cod The rain that continues to fall Thursday for the third day of cool and damp weather is bringing some much needed moisture to areas suffering under drought conditions It’s going to be tough to scour out the clouds even as any leftover rain ends this morning   Temperatures the past two days haven’t changed much at all  As a matter of fact  Boston saw the temperature stuck at 56 or 57 for two solid days  It’s rather unusual in October to see this pattern   as temperatures like this are more commonly seen in April Later Thursday afternoon  there could be some breaks of sunshine  especially west of Route 495  The closer to the coast you are  the less likely skies will clear because of the continued cool flow coming off the water Friday brings a break in the wet weather  as southern New England sits between systems  There will be sunshine  however  and temperatures will recover to the 60s  Another system comes to the region for the first half of the weekend with showers  Most of Saturday will actually be rain free  though the area will likely be damp  The steadiest rain looks to move in after 4 p m  Saturday and continue through the first part of the night Sunday is shaping up to be a super day with sunshine and pleasantly mild air  giving us something to look forward to after a rather gloomy week Thursday  Any leftover showers ending then mostly cloudy  Highs near 60 Thursday night  Partly cloudy  with a low around 50 Friday  Mostly sunny  with highs in the mid 60s Saturday  Mostly cloudy with some morning drizzle or a light shower and steadier showers late in the day  Highs 64 68 Sunday  Sunny  with a high in the mid 60s Sunday night  Mostly clear  with a low around 47 Monday  Mostly sunny  with a high in the upper 60s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
154,After a lousy start to the holiday weekend  Sunday was gorgeous and Columbus Day will repeat that nice weather  After a cool morning  it’s a return to milder weather with highs this afternoon in the lower 60s  Some of you will be working all day  but around lunch time it will be about 60 degrees so it’s a good afternoon to take your lunch outside A southerly flow of air the next few days will bring warmer air and more humidity to the region   Starting Tuesday with highs reaching or exceeding 70 degrees for much of the rest of the workweek Although it’s going to be warm  the weather won’t be all sun and blue skies  A slow moving system to our west will help pull tropical air into the region and this will also bring along with it some showers From Tuesday night through Wednesday there might be a quick shower  mostly in the afternoon   As we head into Thursday the risk for showers increases and most of us get wet   Also  there is the chance for thunderstorms later this week along with gusty winds It’s impossible to predict if there will be any severe weather later this week  but depending on how the atmospheric conditions develop later this week  some areas could see heavy downpours  More on this as we head deeper into the week  but next weekend is looking dry and pleasant after the rain  Today   Mostly sunny with highs in the lower 60s  Overnight    Mostly cloudy but not as chilly with lows in the lower 50s  Tuesday   Clouds with some sunny breaks  Humidity is to be expected with highs between 70 and 75  Wednesday    Warm and a bit humid with a few showers possible during the second part of the afternoon  Highs expected to be in the mid to upper 70s  Thursday   Lots of clouds with periods of showers with highs near 70 degrees  Friday   A blend of clouds and sunshine with a few showers with highs in the upper 60s to near 70 degrees Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
155,The big snowbanks of a week ago have shrunk to almost nothing across southern New England as our January thaw continues  Temperatures will be in the 40s Tuesday morning with the feeling of spring in the air  Roads will be turning damp for the first part of the morning as some light spotty rain passes through  The steadier rain holds until after the morning commute  but will impact the evening one For some areas this evening there could be heavier downpours at times with the homeward bound drive impacted by poor visibility and big puddles Rain comes to an end this evening with partial sunshine for Wednesday  It s still going to be well into the 40s for the afternoon  On Thursday  a storm will pass out to sea to our our east  The western edge of the clouds and showers could impact coastal areas  but presently this looks to be a missed storm for all of southern New England  There isn t any chance of snow as there isn t any cold air around The end of the workweek sees bright and sunny skies for Friday with comfortable  by mid January standards  temperatures  Another storm threatens for the start of the weekend with some rain or snow  It s too early to know if this coastal low will stay over the ocean or bring some rain or snow to the area Tuesday  Light rain in the morning  becoming steadier and heavier in the afternoon  Temperatures remaining in the 40s to near 50 Tuesday night  Showers will end early followed by clearing  Lows 28 in the Worcester hills to 35 in Boston and points south Wednesday  Mostly sunny and continued mild  Highs 45 to 50 Wednesday night  Clouding up  cool  lows 27 to 34 Thursday  Lots of clouds  with a few showers  Best chance for rain south and east  Highs 40 to 45 Friday  Lots of sunshine  highs 41 to 46 Saturday  Mostly cloudy with a chance of rain and snow showers  Highs around 40 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
156,As warm and very humid air attempts to move north Friday  there is a chance of showers and even thunder across the region  It is currently unclear how long the showers will last and if there will be a break in the action Friday afternoon Most models agree the front will make it into southern New England  but then stop somewhere around the Massachusetts Turnpike  If the front lifts further north  you will notice some brightening in Boston later on Friday  and it will become quite warm and humid  However  if the front stalls south of your area  it will remain damp and muggy  but not very warm all day Overnight more showers and the chance of storms resumes due to the cold front moving in from the west  The timing of the front is such that we will have a round of showers in the morning followed by clearing in the afternoon Right now Sunday looks nice and sunny with highs in the upper 70s inland and cooler along the coast There is one potential problem to the entire forecast this weekend  As the front pushes offshore on Saturday evening it will slow down  If the front slows too much  the forecast will dramatically change for Sunday with clouds and showers coming in  especially at the coast Warmer and drier weather arrives early next week Friday  Muggy with showers  highs from 66 to 72  Warmer on the south coast and interior south west Massachusetts Friday night  A few showers and perhaps a thunderstorm late at night  Lows from 62 to 66 Saturday  A few morning showers and a possible thunderstorm  Skies clear west of Route 495 early  but clouds could linger much of the day over eastern areas and Cape Cod  Highs in the 70s Sunday  Sunny inland  but partly sunny along the coast  Highs from 75 to 80 Monday  Sunny  with a high in the upper 70s inland and mid 80s on the coast Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
157,Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is asking state gambling regulators to halt the process for awarding the Boston area casino license until after a November vote on the casino law Walsh announced Thursday he has sent a letter to the Massachusetts Gaming Commission asking that it stay all proceedings on issuing of the eastern region casino license until the fate of the state s 2011 casino law is decided Walsh said he doesn t want to continue spending taxpayer dollars on negotiations with the two Boston area casino applicants  Mohegan Sun and Wynn  on surrounding community impact agreements while the law itself is uncertain The state s highest court cleared the way on Tuesday for the repeal question to be on the ballot The gaming commission has said it intends to continue with the licensing process despite the ruling With reporting by The Associated Press and the WBUR Newsroom Related This article was originally published on June 26  2014 
158,The overnight starts clear  but clouds are expected to roll back into the region ahead of our next storm  There is going to be another nor easter developing along the mid Atlantic coastline and then riding up to the Northeast just off our shoreline A major snowstorm will impact Cape Cod and southeastern Massachusetts Saturday afternoon and the first half of the overnight  Near blizzard conditions are possible at times in these areas In Boston you can expect around 6 inches of snow with about 2 to 4 inches west toward Worcester  The snow begins around or just after noon on Saturday and moves northward into Boston and the north shore by 2 or 3 p m The snow will end after midnight with a return to blustery and cold conditions for Sunday Friday night  Increasing clouds with lows in the mid 20s Saturday  Snow will develop in the early afternoon and could become heavy along the coast  Several inches will fall by the evening with less snowfall west of Route 495  Highs between 30 35 degrees Saturday Night  Several inches of snow will fall along the coast in the evening  and then the snow will end  It will be windy with lows in the teens or low 20s Sunday  Sunny and cold with highs in the 20s Sunday Night  Mostly clear and very cold with lows between 2 and 12 degrees Monday  Sunny with highs in the mid 20s Tuesday  Rain and snow are likely  Mostly cloudy with a high near 40 degrees Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom This article was originally published on February 14  2014 
159,On a clear morning  cold temperatures will make it feel like mid winter  Temperatures will stay in the upper 20s this afternoon and  with a bit of a breeze  it will feel quite cold much of the day  There won’t be any weather issues overnight or again on Tuesday as clouds begin to increase  Temperatures Monday night will fall to the teens  but recover above freezing for Tuesday Tuesday night snow breaks out across southeastern areas of the state after 9 p m  and spreads toward Boston after midnight  The snow will be heavy at times over Cape Cod but much lighter north of Plymouth As the storm intensifies winds will increase and because of the strong winds and potential for heavy snow the National Weather Service has issued a blizzard watch for Cape Cod  In addition to that watch  a winter storm watch for the possibility of heavy snow has been issued for areas south of Boston for parts of Bristol and Plymouth counties Later today as new information about the development of the potential storm becomes available these watches could be upgraded to warnings or dropped altogether  We may have to wait until early Tuesday morning for any chances in the status of these watches The blizzard watch has been posted because strong winds in excess of 35 miles per hour will combine with falling snow to bring at least a three hour period when visibility will fall below a quarter mile The snow prediction totals are not very high and could still swing higher or lower depending on the track of the storm The snow ends in Boston during the morning Wednesday and in the afternoon over Cape Cod  Temperatures will continue to run well below normal remaining in the 30s Milder air finally reaches the region for the end of the week  Although there will be a cool down late in the weekend  much of next week looks to feel more like spring Monday  Sunny and cold with temperatures in the mid to upper 20s  Winds will make it feel like temperatures are in the single digits Monday night  Mostly clear and cold with lows in the teens Tuesday  Sunny with clouds increasing later in the day  Highs in the mid 30s Tuesday night  Snow over Cape Cod and Southeastern Massachusetts before midnight and Boston after midnight  Lows in the 20s  Little snow west of Route 495 and north of the Pike  It will become very windy  especially along the coastline and Cape Islands Wednesday  Snows exits the area during the morning and early afternoon Thursday  Sunny and not as cold Friday  Milder You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
160,Cold weather continues with temperatures running up to 15 degrees below normal levels for this time of year each afternoon this week The weather will be mostly dry through Friday with the exception of a few periods of some snow showers crossing the area and dusting the ground with up to half an inch of snow  While snow is in the forecast for Wednesday  Thursday and again Saturday  this appears to be of nuisance  not significant value High pressure will be in control today  but the origin of the high from Canada continues to provide the cold air  The wind will remain busy and drop wind chills into the teens and single digits at times during the day Another cold night lies ahead with temperatures falling well into the teens in most areas  A weak system without much moisture crosses New England Wednesday and brings with it a chance for a period of flurries or snow showers  Behind this  more cold air arrives especially Thursday night and Friday morning  Winds at the end of the week will be a factor making it feel even colder The start of the weekend looks dry and  of course  cold  but storms will develop late in the weekend or early next week  There is a high probability of a storm between Sunday and Tuesday  but the details of this won’t be known for several days Tuesday  Sunny this morning with some clouds this afternoon  Breezy at times  Highs of 24 to 29 Tuesday night  Partly cloudy  Lows of 12 to 19 Wednesday  Snow showers in the morning  The commute should not be overly affected by the snow  Highs in the 20s Thursday  A chance of snow shower  but otherwise partly sunny and cold  Highs continue to be in the 20s Friday  Sunny but colder with highs in the lower 20s Saturday  A chance of snow showers  Mostly cloudy with highs in the upper 20s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
161,A big ocean storm will brush by Cape Cod  Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket today bringing damaging winds  power outages and a moderate amount of snow  The combination of wind and snow has prompted blizzard warnings to be issued There is a coastal flood warning around Boston  Hull and Plymouth this morning and other north facing beaches in this area until 10 a m  Any flooding will be minor and just involve mostly beach erosion The high winds are the big issue today with a high wind warning for Plymouth County  Cape Cod and the Islands as winds could gust over 50 miles per hour  Farther north and west  a wind advisory is in place for today  Winds will not be damaging but will be gusty all day Power outages are most likely over Cape Cod  The blizzard warning for the Cape and Islands will expire early this afternoon as the snow winds down and ends For most of you  today is just a cloudy  cold day with a gusty wind  Travel won’t be a problem in and around Boston  but will be difficult over Cape Cod Tomorrow will still be breezy  but highs will reach the 40 degree mark  It turns even milder for Friday and Saturday with highs in the 50s and a chance of showers A big ocean storm continues to strengthen out in the ocean  This storm will pull east and north during the day today and take the snow and the strongest winds with it this afternoon   A milder flow of air with more clouds and rain showers starts our weekend Wednesday  Snow over Cape Cod and the Islands ending between 1 and 4 p m  Elsewhere any flurries or light snow ends this morning  Very windy and cold with highs between 32 and 37 Wednesday night  Clearing and cold  Lows in the teens  Winds continue to be strong with wind chills in the single digits nearing zero Thursday  Mostly sunny and blustery  Highs of 36 to 41 Friday  Clouds and a few showers  Still windy  Highs in the lower 50s Saturday  Showers likely in the afternoon  Highs in the lower 50s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
162,Mild temperatures and a bit of sunshine are on their way   making this weekend a spring teaser of sorts The melting of limited snowpack will continue  making way for new snow next week This morning is not as cold as the past several daysb and by this afternoon all areas will hit and surpass the melting point  I expect 40F to be common south of the turnpike  with upper 30s to the north  If you have an opportunity to get outside this afternoon take it  as this will be the brightest of the next several days Saturday features a lot of cloud cover  but there won t be any rain or snow  Highs will be slightly cooler than today without the sunshine  but still in the mid to upper 30s  A weak and fast moving system to our west brings some light rain showers later Saturday night into the first few hours after Sunday s sunrise  Sunday will be the mildest of the next seven days  and it will certainly have that spring feeling as temperatures rise well into the 40s A coastal low will brush by on Monday  and we will have to keep a close eye on how far the precipitation shield pushes west to the coast   There could be some snow during the morning commute Monday south of Boston A lull in the action is around for Tuesday with dry and seasonably cold weather   A more important storm will impact the area Tuesday night and Wednesday  Right now  I expect the morning and afternoon commutes to be impacted  While the forecast will change  there is a strong enough likelihood in a mid week storm to recommend thinking about changing plans any plans you might have for late Tuesday until Wednesday Today  Partly sunny and milder high 37 42 Tonight  Mostly cloudy  not so cold lows in the mid 20s Saturday  Mostly cloudy  highs 36 41 Saturday night  A passing rain shower late at night  Lows 33 38 Sunday  Any showers end early  cloudy and mild in the afternoon  Highs 43 48 Sunday night  A period of snow south of Boston  mixed rain snow near the Cape  28 35 Monday  Any snow ends then  Partly sunny  with highs 30 35 Tuesday  Mostly sunny  with a high near 35 Tuesday night  Snow  Lows in the mid upper 20s Wednesday  Rain  snow and sleet  Temperatures in the 30s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
163,A dramatically cooler day is in store as temperatures are some 35 degrees cooler to start today from the highs yesterday  Marine air has infiltrated the area overnight and will remain in place for the next 24 hours  Don’t expect much if any sunshine today  I am not putting showers in the forecast  although if you are near the water you might feel some drizzle or mist in the air Temperatures will only rise about 5 or 6 degrees from their early morning readings  West of Route 495 it will be a bit milder  reaching the upper 50s to near 60 This will be a better evening for sleeping as lows fall into the 40s  There may be a stray sprinkle  but it’s basically dry  Tomorrow is still cool and clouds will dominate  Temperatures will reach the lower to mid 60s after 1 or 2 p m  as warmer air makes its way toward New England Thursday is much warmer and more humid  Highs will reach the 70s and you will definitely notice the moisture  A shower is possible in the afternoon  A better chance of showers arrives later Friday and especially at night  These showers likely continue into the start of the weekend A series of quick weather changes over the next three days will take us from cool marine air to muggy air to some downpours  Between any rain there will be periods of dry weather and sunshine  Sunday looks to be the better of the two weekend days Tuesday  Mostly cloudy and much cooler  Highs in mid 50s Tuesday night  Mostly cloudy with lows in the mid 40s Wednesday  Lots of clouds with some sunny breaks  Not as cool with highs in the mid 60s Thursday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A shower or storm possible  Somewhat muggy with highs in the mid 70s Friday  Partly sunny with a shower possible  Highs of 70 to 76 Saturday  Lots of clouds and showers likely  Some downpours possible  Highs of 65 to 71 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
164,While there are showers in the forecast today  most of us will remain dry  The best chance of showers comes this morning into early afternoon  Any showers that do occur should be quick but there could be gusty winds and also a rumble of thunder with some heavier downpours   The threat of showers continues through the overnight hours and into early Wednesday before clearing moves into the areas for the second half of the day Temperatures both today and tomorrow will be unseasonably mild reaching the upper 60s to lower 70s  It will even feel a bit humid in the afternoon as a southerly breeze ahead of a cold front moves somewhat tropical air northwardI am not expecting much sunshine today  but there is the chance for some breaks of sun at times You’ll notice a good clearing trend tomorrow afternoon after the morning showers   The morning commute could be impacted by the rain tomorrow so you might want to plan on leaving a bit early Thursday brings sunshine and dry Canadian air to southern New England  This means highs will be slightly under average and there will be abundant sunshine  Another fast moving system puts back rain into the forecast Friday  mostly south of Boston  This system exits the areas for the weekend with sunshine and seasonably cool readings Foliage viewing should be terrific both Saturday and Sunday Tuesday  Lots of clouds  A small chance of showers or thunderstorms  mostly in the first half of the day  Highs in the upper 60s to around 70 Tuesday night  A period or two of showers with a thunderstorm late at night  It will be mild with lows in the upper 50s Wednesday  Morning showers  then clearing in the afternoon  Highs around 70 Thursday  Sunny and cooler with highs nearing 60 Friday  Lots of clouds with a period of rain possible  mostly to the south   Highs of 55 to 60 Saturday  Mostly sunny with a high in the upper 50s to near 60 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
165,Enjoy the mild air the next couple of days because a big shift in temperatures is looming on the horizon  Highs this time of year should still be getting into the upper 50s to even around 60 Today we will be in the upper 60s to near 70 and likely as warm if not a few degrees warmer tomorrow  Then the temperature begins to drop on Thursday as colder and drier air filters in  By Friday we lose a few more degrees with highs by then only in the lower 50s  but at least there will be a lot of sunshine Anytime we have snow in the forecast there starts to be all sorts of wild forecasts as to what might happen  On Friday night a low pressure area to our west will begin to transfer its energy to the coast and form a new storm This new low pressure system will develop and have with it quite a bit of rain and even snow The big question becomes how close to the coast does this storm come and what is the timing of the system  Currently some rain is likely to fall Saturday and may end as a period of snow showers or light snow Saturday night and Sunday morning There is also an equal likelihood right now that the storm moves too far north and east before it develops so that we end up dry  windy and cold by Sunday morning after a short period of rain Halloween evening and night What is a sure bet is the cold and highs on Sunday will be more typical for early December  not the first of November  If you haven’t brought out the winter weight coats and blankets  it’s time The forecast is going to change quite a bit over the next three days so check my updates on Twitter and look for a new forecast each day here Tuesday  Mostly sunny and mild with highs of 65 to 70 Tuesday night  Partly cloudy and not so cold with lows in the 50s Wednesday  Lots of clouds with some breaks of sun  A few midday showers or thunderstorms between noon and 5 p m   earliest to the west  latest on Cape Cod   Highs of 65 to 72 Thursday  Mostly sunny and cooler with highs in the mid 50s Friday  Partly sunny with highs of 50 to 55 Saturday  A chance of rain  It will be very raw and chilly  Highs of 40 to 45 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
166,Snow is in the air Friday morning with a few spots picking up a coating of an inch at most  The inch total would be the exception  not the rule  Nonetheless  the snow could cause some slick spots on the roads and slow down the morning commute This is the first of two weekend weather events  Friday night  as warmer air continues to stream northward  there could be a few rain or snow showers  Again  some slick spots could show up  but this is not going be a widespread situation  and many of you will see nothing overnight As the warmer wind picks up Saturday  rain is going to push across the area  While showery at first  this rain is poised to become heavy for the afternoon and evening  There is a lot of tropical moisture riding northward into the system  That means you can expect big puddles on the roads Saturday evening if you are headed out for a movie or dinner If you are going to be at the Patriots game  this is one of those games to bring out the waterproof gear There will be zero chance of any ice or snow Saturday night so  while wet  the roads will not be snowy  Temperatures Saturday are going to be spring like  rising in the 50s  It will stay mild for much of Saturday night  By Sunday morning  temperatures will still be in the lower 40s in many places Sunday is my pick for the weekend  which should be somewhat obvious after a soaking Saturday  Skies will clear early in the morning  leaving us with a bright and sunny sky and mild air  Highs won’t be quite as warm as they will be Saturday  but they will still range from 45 52 north to south  not a bad temperature range in mid January Friday  A few periods of snow showers this morning  A coating to 1 inch of snow possible  Highs 34 40 Friday night  A quick snow or rain shower possible  Not as cold  Lows 30 35 Saturday  Rain overspreading the area during the late morning and early afternoon  Becoming windy and mild  Highs in the low to mid 50s  Rain could be heavy at times causing some street flooding Saturday Night  Rain during the evening tapering to showers and ending  Still windy and mild lows in the upper 30s to mid 40s Sunday  Clearing and becoming sunny  Still unseasonably mild  Highs in the mid to upper 40s Sunday night  Mostly clear  with a low around 25 34Monday  Mostly sunny  with a high near 45 50Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
167,We haven’t seen much rain lately  However  roads are wet in many areas this morning as sporadic showers fall Friday morning Chances of rain will diminish as the day goes on  and by afternoon  I don’t expect there to be many showers left on the radar  What we will be left with are lots of clouds and little  if any sunshine  especially along the coast  Inland areas might see pop up sprinkles Friday afternoon  but I am not expecting anything that would deter outdoor plans Friday night will turn out to have a lot of clouds and temperatures will continue to provide the same great sleeping conditions we have had as of late  Lows will remain in the lower 60s in Boston  but as soon as you get into the suburbs away from the heat islands effect  temperatures will cool to the upper 50s I am expecting a nice overall weekend  There will likely be quite a few clouds early Saturday  but sunny skies are on tap  I also expect Saturday will be a slightly warmer day because of the added sun  If you are headed to the beach  sunset is right around 7 30 p m  this weekend — about an hour later than it was in early July Sunday will be the better of the two weekend days with the most sunshine and slightly warmer afternoon highs in the 70s  The start of next week also looks great with more sunshine and seasonably warm air Friday  Early showers ending over eastern areas  then remaining mostly cloudy and quite cool with highs around or just under 70 degrees Friday night  Mostly cloudy and seasonable with lows in the upper 50s to near 60 degrees Saturday  A blend of clouds and sunshine with highs in the lower 70s  Pop up showers in isolated areas possible around mid day Sunday  Sunny with highs in the mid 70s on the coast and the upper 70s inland Monday  Sunny with highs nearing 80 degrees Tuesday  Sunny with highs around 80 degrees and cooler at the beaches Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

169,Rain is going to mess up the Monday morning commute more than a Monday morning commute already is a rough one  Rain will fall most of the day with a break possible in the action during the middle of the day At times  heavier downpours will cause some minor street flooding   There could even be a rumble of thunder south of Boston this afternoon and first part of the evening as a front crosses the area Winds are going to become strong this afternoon and a high wind warning has been issued for Cape Cod and the Islands until 11 p m  this evening In the Boston area a wind advisory is posted for gusty winds but not as strong as over southeastern Massachusetts  Where winds are strongest there could be some scattered power outages and tree damage The rain rapidly comes to an end overnight and temperatures will fall back into the 30s   Tomorrow is a bright and sunny day  but cold   The cold becomes even more pronounced on Wednesday when it remains around freezing in the coldest spots and in the mid 30s in Boston  These temperatures are typical for late December  not this time of year The cold continues into the weekend with temperatures fluctuating from the lower 30s to the lower 40s during this time  While some days will be less cold than others  the entire period is significantly below average There is a high likelihood of a big warm up next week with temperatures getting above normal and the chance of a rain storm early in the week  Thanksgiving is currently looking dry and cold as is the day before for traveling   More on this part of the forecast throughout this week Monday  Rain and a chance of thunderstorms this evening  especially from Boston south  Highs in the 50s to lower 60s over southeastern Massachusetts to mid 50s in Boston to mid 40s in Worcester Hills Monday night  Rain ending this evening  Winds will be gusty the first half of the night  Lows in the 30s Tuesday  Mostly sunny and blustery  Highs of 33 to 39 Wednesday  Sunny and still blustery  Highs of 30 to 38 Thursday  Partly sunny and breezy with highs of 40 to 45 Friday  Mostly sunny and still cold  Highs of 37 to 42 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
170,Another day of mild weather with highs reaching the lower 70s at the mildest  with temperatures in the mid and upper 60s over Cape Cod  Clouds will thicken Wednesday  and there will be a band of showers approaching the region in the early afternoon  passing off the coast just before sunset Thursday is a great day with plenty of sunshine with dry air and highs typical for late October   Friday is still dry and somewhat seasonable  It will feel colder by the end of the day The weekend is going to be cold  There is not any question that it’s going to feel more like Thanksgiving than Halloween this weekend  Highs on Saturday will reach the 40s  On Sunday  temperatures will stay in the 30s over Worcester County and the lower 40s in Boston If you are headed to the Patriots game you will need to dress for a chilly game  but I don’t expect any rain or snow The question with regard to precipitation comes on Saturday and Saturday night when a storm may come close enough to bring some rain and even interior snow It’s still a bit early to know exactly how much  if any  rain we see  Northern New England has the best chance of seeing any snow  but even there  it’s possible the storm will stay off the coast too far to bring anything significant Wednesday  Thickening clouds and possibly scattered showers  mainly after noon  Mild with highs between 68 72 Wednesday night  Scatterned showers ending then clearing  Lows in the 40s Thursday  Mostly sunny  with a high between 55 58  Winds from the west around 8 mph Friday  Mostly sunny  with a high between 50 55 and cooler later in the day Saturday  Raw with a chance of rain Sunday  Any precipitation ends followed by nighttime clearing  Chilly  Highs between 38 44 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
171,Mild air flowing northward brings our April showers for the morning commute  This means wet roads and slow going on the major highways  Before 9 a m  the rain will come down very hard and there could be the rumble of thunder  After 9 a m   we will see the rain taper and skies will partially clear  If we get enough sunshine  temperatures could nudge the upper 60s in spots  but even in the absence of full sunshine  it s going to be mild Later this afternoon there might be another shower  but it will be light and scattered and some areas won t see the second round  Behind this front cooler air arrives for Wednesday with plenty of sunshine Thursday is my pick of the week with mild air and sunshine  It will be in the 60s and more greening of the landscape will continue to take place  A quick front pushes by on Friday and brings the change for more showers  The weekend looks nice  but there may be some lingering showers early Saturday The rain today is being caused by a pair of fronts passing through the area  High pressure builds back into the area for the middle of the week before another front moves in for Friday Tuesday  Showers  heaviest this morning  with some midday sunshine and a quick evening shower  Highs in the upper 50s to mid 60s Tuesday night  Partly cloudy with a low near 40 Wednesday  Sunny and cooler  Highs in the mid 50s Thursday  Sunny  breezy and mild with highs in the lower to middles 60s Friday  Mostly cloudy with some breaks of sun and a period of showers  High of 60 to 65 Saturday  Partly sunny with a high in the lower 60s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
172,Although this morning is comfortably cool  temperatures are going to be heating up very quickly  and I expect most areas to be in the 80 degree range by late morning These warm readings will continue through 5 p m  before temperatures fall back into the 70s  You will notice the air still feels dry most of the day  but there will be an increase in the humidity by sunset Overnight it will be quite warm to start the evening  However  with clear skies and light winds  you will see temperatures fall back into the 60s  It won t be uncomfortable for sleeping  but a fan will be a good idea Friday is the hottest day of the week of this current summer stretch  It s also likely the hottest day we will see until next summer  It s not impossible that temperatures reach 90 degrees even in October  but the odds are rapidly decreasing that this will occur A cold front comes pushing through the region on Saturday  I am already concerned about possible strong to severe weather for late that day and early in the evening  I ll have more about this in the next two days  but you should be aware that outdoor activities may be interrupted late Saturday Drier and more comfortable air arrives on Sunday and highs will return to the 70s  which is closer to weather typically seen during the second week of September If you love the summer heat  enjoy the next three days as this will come to an end soon Thursday  Sunny and very warm  Highs between 83 88 Thursday night  Mostly clear and turning muggy by morning  Lows in the low to mid 60s Friday  Sunny  hot and humid  Highs near 90 Saturday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Warm and humid  Some afternoon and evening thunderstorms developing  These storms could be strong to severe  Highs in the 80s Sunday  Partly sunny and noticeably cooler with highs in the low to mid 70s Monday  Sunny  with a high near 75 degrees Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
173,Today will be a milder day with abundant sunshine and temperatures getting near 60  With the light wind and warmer temperatures it will feel quite comfortable this afternoon  It won’t be so cold overnight as a southerly flow of air keeps readings above freezing  Wednesday has more in the way of clouds mixing with the sunshine  but it will be very mild reaching the mid to upper 60s  If there is enough sunshine some spots could touch 70 Another storm brings rain later Thursday night and the first part of Friday before colder air moves in for the weekend  Another weather maker could bring more rain Sunday Our active weather pattern will bring about a lot of changing weather in the next several days  Overall  we will trend colder late this week and it is looking like much of the rest of November is going to be colder than average Tuesday  Mostly sunny with highs of 55 to 60 Tuesday night  Clear and not as cool  Lows of 35 to 43 Wednesday  Partly sunny and breezy in the afternoon  Highs in the mid to upper 60s Thursday  Rain developing with highs in the upper 50s Friday  Morning showers then cloudy  Some breaks late in the day with a high near 55 Saturday  Sunny with a high of 45 to 50 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

175,It’s chilly to the north of the Massachusetts Turnpike this morning with some areas over the north shore and along the New Hampshire border seeing readings in the 30s and lower 40s To the south  in Boston temperatures are in the lower 60s  The warm air will win out temporarily today with highs reaching the 70s in most areas  Along the south coast and Cape Cod it will be cooler with highs in the upper 50s and lower 60s  The further inland you travel  the milder it will become I expect to see a lot of sunshine today with the only issue being a strong southwest wind later this morning and into the afternoon Tonight will be another mild night with some patches of fog along the coast  Lows will stay in the 50s for most and it’s a keep the windows open kind of evening Tomorrow showers are back in the forecast  but most of them will occur during the second half of the day and the first half of the night  This means the morning commute is mostly dry  but the evening one has a better chance of seeing rain and slowdowns I am not expecting enough rain to cause issues with rivers or even basements  but there could be heavy enough showers to see some street flooding Temperatures start warm and end up cold by morning  Many areas will be near freezing by Wednesday morning  over 40 degrees colder than this afternoon The chilly air continues through Friday with a moderating trend into the weekend  Presently  Patriots Day looks seasonable with partly sunny skies Monday  Mostly sunny with a high of 71 to 76  60s on Cape Cod   Breezy with a gusty afternoon wind Monday night  Mild and breezy with clouds increasing  Lows of 52 to 59 Tuesday  Breezy and mild with showers developing mostly in the afternoon  Highs of 65 to 70 with a touch of humidity in the air Tuesday night  Showers  heaviest before midnight  Thunder possible  Lows falling to 32 to 37 by morning Wednesday  Sunny  blustery and cold  Highs of 41 to 46 Thursday  Sunny with a high in the mid 40s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
176,A very slow moving front will continue to bring the threat of showers and thunderstorms to the area through Wednesday  During this period  we will have many hours of dry weather Eventually  especially later Tuesday and Wednesday  the longest lasting period will move east through southern New England  If you have some outdoor plans  the middle part of today looks dry Tuesday there is still the risk of showers and some thunderstorms  The storms could contain heavy rain and produce some street flooding  Since the frontal system is moving in from the west  the farther west you live from the coast the higher the risk of rain As the front moves eastward Wednesday  the risk of showers will increase along the coastal plain and decrease over western areas of the region  Finally  on Wednesday night the front will pass off the coast and allow for less humid air to replace the tropical air making things very muggy Even with a lack of full sunshine  the air is warm enough for temperatures to reach the lower 80s Monday and Tuesday  On Wednesday  with rain and even thicker clouds  temperatures will be in the 70s The best weather this week is clearly going to be Thursday through Saturday  These three days will feature sunshine  drier air and warm temperatures  Sunday is a bit questionable as another system moves into New England Abnormally cold air moving into the center part of the country is pulling abnormally moisture laden air northward into New England  The contrast between these two different air masses will keep the weather unsettled here through Thursday  High pressure builds back for the end of the week and a return to nice weather Monday  Lots of clouds and humid with the chance of mainly afternoon showers and thunderstorms  Highs in the lower 80s  cooler on Cape Cod and the Islands  Monday night  Warm and muggy with scattered late night showers and storms  Some of these could contain heavy rain  Lows near 70 Tuesday  Humid with scattered showers and storms  Highs in the lower 80s  A few breaks of sun  but clouds dominate Wednesday  Showers and storms ending later in the afternoon  Highs in the mid 70s to near 80 Thursday  Mostly sunny with a high near 80 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high again around 80 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
177,A pair of brilliantly sunny days are on the way  with readings suggesting a near 100 percent chance of the possible sunshine  Although it will be bright  the air is going to remain cold  Highs over the next two days are expected to stay in the mid 20s with little melting of the snow High pressure from Canada will slip eastward on Wednesday and allow a storm to move up the coastline  This storm will bring a mix of snow and rain to the area  Before the storm impacts southern New England it will bring the same variety of weather to areas like New York  Philadelphia and Washington  If you have travel plans Wednesday south of the area and Thursday around our area you may want to change them The storm will start as snow around the morning commute Thursday and the evening commute will be messy with rain and snow at the coast and heavy wet snow inland  The exact track of the storm will determine how much snow each area sees before any change to rain The ski areas will see a large snowstorm from this event  which is perfect timing for school vacation week next week Today  Sunny and cold with highs only in the mid 20s  A cold wind chill brings temperatures below zero at times Wednesday  Sunny  with highs again in the mid 20s Wednesday night  Becoming cloudy with snow beginning around the morning commute  Lows in the upper teens to mid 20s Thursday  Snow  mixing with and changing to rain along the coast and some inland areas  The track of the storm will determine snow amounts for your area  Highs 31 39 Thursday night  Precipitation ending  Lows in the upper 20s Friday  Partly sunny  with a high near 35 40 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

179,Rain  some of it heavy  is in the forecast for today  with the bulk of the rain falling before 3 p m  There are flood watches in place for the coast and inland areas as well  The coastal flood watches are for mostly splash over during the time of high tide  while the watches inland are for street and urban street flooding The weather system causing the problems is now pushing into New England from the south  The heaviest of the rain will fall during the first half of the day  but showers and storms are also likely this afternoon  These situations can yield some severe weather  This is not a case where severe weather would be widespread  but rather it will be isolated and mostly of Boston The biggest issue today will be with the tropical downpours  The rain last night came down at over three inches per hour across New Jersey and this heavy rain can impact parts of our area today  Driving will be almost impossible in these torrential rains Winds will be gusty at times along the coast  but nothing so strong as to cause power outages  The quick hitting nature of these rains is what is so remarkable  not necessarily the total amount I am expecting one to three inches of rain statewide  but some areas that do see severe weather or a large thunderstorm could exceed these numbers  These storms can cause flash flooding to occur  Remember  if you do come upon a road that is flooded do not drive through it  You have no idea how deep the water might be and the waters can rise in moments The weather returns to sunshine and seasonable or slightly below seasonable temperatures Thursday and into the weekend  This weekend will also feature dry and comfortable air Wednesday  Showers  with thunderstorms also possible after 2 p m  Some of the storms could produce heavy rain and frequent lightning  Highs in the 70s with muggy air Wednesday Night  Showers and thunderstorms likely early  then clearing by morning  Humidity levels will fall after midnight  Lows near 60 Thursday  Mostly sunny and pleasant  highs in the mid 70s Friday  Mostly sunny afternoon  reading in the mid 70s Saturday  Sunny  highs in the upper 70s Sunday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A pop up late day storm possible  Highs 75 80 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
180,There is a severe thunderstorm watch for most of Massachusetts and much of New England through 9 p m  Saturday evening  Any severe storms could contain damaging winds  torrential rain and hail A strong cold front pushes east through New England Saturday evening  helping to create a line of thunderstorms  As the front moves into the Atlantic  drier and more tranquil weather will replace the unusual September heat The thunderstorms will put an end to the recent heat and humidity as cooler air move into the region by morning Sunday will be drier and cooler with a blend of cloud and sunshine and high temperatures in the 70s Some morning lows on Monday will be in the 40s for a true taste of fall  The fine September weather should continue into the middle of next week 
181,A storm will bring rain and wind to the region Saturday into the evening hours along with gusty winds and chilly temperatures  The storm comes in two waves with the first batch of rain lasting into the middle of the evening As a second wave of low pressure passes up the coast early Sunday bringing another round of rain especially east of the Interstate 95 corridor  It may be cold enough for some wet snow in the higher elevations If the Sunday morning system tracks close enough to the coastline then there could be a slushy accumulation of snow on the grass  car tops and other colder surfaces  The most likely spots for this would be higher elevations and areas north toward southern Maine and New Hampshire Winds are going to be the big issue with this system as they will gust over 50 miles per hour along the coast and into the 40s inland  These types of wind speed can cause power outages and bring down some tree limbs or unhealthy trees Any coastal flooding will be minor  but there will also be beach erosion The winds will be strong into Sunday morning before diminishing late in the day Temperatures will be cold all weekend and get even colder Sunday night when most areas experience their first freeze of the season Sunshine returns on Monday with highs in the 40s and it turns even milder Tuesday Today  Windy with rain developing  Highs in the mid 40s Tonight  Rain ending between 8 and 10 p m  Windy  lows in the upper 30s Sunday  A period of morning rain and snow then cloudy  clearing late  Windy  Highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s Monday  Sunny  with a high in the mid 40s  Still breezy Tuesday  Mostly sunny  with a high in the mid 50s

183,Not much sunshine will be around today as the weather system which brought all the rain to the west coast last week makes it to New England in a highly weakened form  There might be some drizzle or shower activity later this afternoon  but  in general  it’s a dry and fairly mild day for the start of the second half of December Later tonight an area of showers will bring about a quarter inch of rain to the area as it passes  This isn’t much rain  and there’s not need to worry about any flooding or even big puddled with this system Clearing comes slow  as the clouds — and even a chance of snow or rain showers — lingers into Thursday  We have to wait until Friday for the sunshine to return in full  Highs at the end of the week will be colder  but still seasonably chilly for this time of year Shopping this weekend is a priority for many  and Saturday will be dry and bright so no need to worry about the roads  at least from the weather  A storm passes to our south on Sunday  Presently it looks like it will miss southern New England  but it’s a close call so stay turned to my latest updates here and on Twitter Tuesday  Lots of clouds with some spotty drizzle or mist late in the day  Highs in the lower 40s Tuesday night  Mild with a period of showers later in the evening and overnight  Lows near 40 Wednesday  Early showers  then clouds with a few breaks of sunshine  Highs of 45 to 50 Thursday  A few morning snow showers  becoming partly sunny and blustery  Highs of 38 to 43 Friday  Mostly sunny with highs in the upper 30s Saturday  Mostly sunny with highs of 35 to 40 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

192,A very vigorous system for early October is moving through the area this morning bringing showers and thunderstorms and slowing down the morning commute  These storms are coming up from the south and are part of a system which brought severe weather to the mid Atlantic region earlier Tuesday night  This is a very fast moving system and as such will be gone between 8 and 10 a m  depending on where you live There is a small chance of severe weather and even a spin up of a weak tornado  but this is the exception to the general downpours this morning  This afternoon skies will clear and it will be quite nice with above normal temperature readings around the 70 degree mark Thursday brings more sunshine  but cooler readings with highs only around 60 degrees  The air will also feel much drier with low levels of humidity More changes come Friday as a weather system moves to our south  The exact track of this system will determine if the rain shield comes to Boston  stays south over Cape Cod or less likely reaches the border towns of New Hampshire Friday does look like a transitional day as that storm gathers in the Ohio Valley and moves to the mid Atlantic coastline  As the system gets closer  clouds will increase in the afternoon  but I don t expect any rain until late at night Saturday is the big question mark for the weekend  Sunday is sunny  cool and dry  but Saturday could end up wet in the morning or just cloudy  We’ll have to wait another day to gain more confidence in the start of the holiday weekend forecast Today  Showers and thunderstorms before 10 a m  Some of the storms could produce gusty winds and heavy rain  but becoming mostly sunny in the afternoon with high near 72  Gusty winds could cause scattered power issues and downed trees Overnight  Mostly clear  with lows in the mid 40s but breezy Thursday  Sunny with a high in the lower 60s Friday  Sunshine followed by increasing clouds with highs in the mid 60s Saturday  Morning showers possible but clearing north to south in the afternoon with highs in the lower 60s Sunday  Mostly sunny with a high between 57 and 61 degrees Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
193,It’s a cold morning across the region with temperatures in the single digits and even a couple degrees below zero across the north  West of Route 128 this morning there is a wind chill advisory until 10 a m  You can expect it to feel well below zero through mid morning  Actual temperatures remain in the 12 to 17 degree range The cold continues overnight with similar temperatures and a slight breeze  At cold levels like this  only a 5 or 10 mile per hour breeze can bring temperatures below zero quickly  I expect lows to fall below zero in a few spots and end up around 6 or 7 at Logan Airport Friday is still cold with highs only 10 to 15  Across the southern part of Cape Cod and the islands  highs will reach the upper teens to near 20 On Saturday  the winds will flip direction and come more from the south  This will bring milder air to the area for a few hours  Highs will reach the upper 20s to mid 30s  and it will feel like spring after this cold shot  Don’t get used to the milder conditions because they aren’t going to last long  A front will cross the area during the afternoon and bring a bit of snow  While this won’t be a big system  roads could become slippery as the snow accumulates a coating to 1 inch The snow ends early Saturday evening before it becomes colder again on Sunday  A quick burst of snow may occur Monday morning  As this system exits the region even colder air will move in for next week Thursday  Partly sunny and cold  Highs of 12 to 17  near 20 in Nantucket  Thursday Night  A few clouds  but otherwise clear  Lows  5 to 8  10 to 15 on the Cape and islands  Friday  Mostly sunny  Very cold  Highs of 9 to 15 Friday Night  Becoming cloudy  Lows in the single digits Saturday  Snow showers with highs likely in the lower to middle 30s  Some ran could mix in Nantucket Saturday Night  Snow showers end  Cold with a low of 8 to 15 Sunday  Mostly sunny with highs 18 to 25 Monday  Early snow showers  then partly sunny with a high of 28 to 34  Colder much of next week

195,Be sure to carry an umbrella with you over the next few days  as showers will punctuate the weekend  A strong southerly flow of air will bring mild temperatures to the region this afternoon  There will be a lot of clouds today and just a break or two of sunshine  Late in the afternoon or evening some showers could cross the area Areas over northern Worcester County might see a shower this morning  but these should not make it too far east  and Boston will have to wait until this afternoon and evening to see rain As the showers end they leave us with a breezy and very mild temperatures overnight  It’s been a long time since we stayed over 40 degrees all night  but we will tonight Saturday morning is dry  and there may be a few peaks of sunshine  However  the afternoon and evening turn wet as rain overspreads the area The rain continues Saturday night and Sunday for a wet and windy period  The rain will likely amount to between 2 and 3 inches for most of us  and some areas could see up to 4 inches in heavier pockets While March has been cold  it’s also been dry so the rivers and streams can handle a lot of water before flooding  There will be street flooding Saturday night and Sunday so if you are traveling expect to contend with big puddles  especially on parts of Storrow Drive in Boston and Route 9  west of the city Drier weather returns late Monday and Tuesday  with seasonable temperatures for the mid week period The upcoming rain is due to a low pressure area moving up the coastline  and while this isn’t going to bring snow  it’s still a nor’easter  There will be heavy precipitation  wind and even some coastal flooding  The storm slowly moves into the Canadian Maritimes Sunday night and Monday Friday  Showers late in the afternoon after a mostly cloudy and blustery day  Highs between 52 56 degrees Friday night  A few showers early otherwise mild and breezy overnight   Lows in the lower 40s Saturday  Cloudy in the morning with rain developing in the afternoon and evening   Rain will be steadiest by dark  Highs in the upper 40s to low 50s Saturday night  Rain could be heavy at times  Blustery with lows between 38 44 degrees Sunday  Rain and raw  Highs in the lower 40s Sunday night  A few periods of showers overnight with lows in the 30s Monday  Rain or mix of rain  snow or sleet ending and then clearing  but chilly with highs in the 40s Tuesday  Partly sunny with a high near 50 degrees Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
196,If you left your windows open Thursday night  it’s likely very cool in your house I’m not sure if you turned your heat on yet  but Friday morning is one of those mornings that temps me to put it on  Later Friday afternoon temperatures will rebound to the upper 50s  which is quite a bit below normal  The sun is getting lower and lower in the sky  so it will remain very chilly in the shady spots throughout Friday A cold front went by the area Thursday evening and allowed this quick shot of cold air to move through the area  Frosty — even freezing — conditions were seen Friday morning across northern New England  where some regions have now seen an end to their growing season If you don’t like the cold  don t fret  It’s not going to last very long  Although Saturday morning will also be chilly  Saturday afternoon’s highs will reach the upper 60s  rising to nearly 10 degrees warmer than today  There should also be lots of sunshine Friday and Saturday Sunday is still looking like a summer like day with highs near 80F and light winds  There will be some clouds later in the afternoon  but I still think Sunday is going to be a great beach day  There might be a shower late Sunday evening before the weather turns more seasonable early next week  If Boston doesn’t see any significant rain the rest of the month  this is going to be the driest September in 57 years Friday  Sunny and noticeably cooler  Highs in the upper 50s to near 60 Friday night  Clear and chilly  Lows 38 44 Saturday  Mostly sunny milder  Highs 65 70 Sunday  Lots of sunshine and warm  Highs 75 80 Monday  Mostly sunny with a high near 70 Tuesday  Mostly sunny with a high in the mid 60s You can follow David Epstein’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
197,One more day of heat Wednesday with a chance of highs reaching 90 in Boston for only the 5th time this summer  Boston s Logan Airport hasn t broken 85 the entire month of August A southwest flow of air will continue to bring the heat and the humidity into the area ahead of a cold front to our west  As this front marches east  some thunderstorm activity could pop up  Any storms that do form will be isolated  The best opportunity for any storms comes in the afternoon  when temperatures are warmest and the air is less stable A southwest flow means Cape Cod and the Islands will be significantly cooler than areas north of Plymouth where readings could reach 90 or higher  Humidity is going to be noticeable Wednesday  but drier air will arrive by Thursday Thursday through Saturday looks warm and dry with abundant sunshine  Temperatures will be seasonable during this period  which means 70s to near 80 There are still a lot of questions around the forecast for Sunday and Monday  It doesn t appear we will have a washout either day  but showers could occur  The warmest day will be Sunday  with humidity and highs in the 80s  Temperatures in the 70s will return for Monday  but still the risk of some shower activity  I ll be updating the timing of the showers and the amount of possible rain as we get closer to the weekend On a side note  seas will increase offshore and rip currents will be an issue late Wednesday and more likely Thursday as hurricane Cristobal passes offshore  so be careful if you are headed to the beach Wednesday   Mostly Sunny and hot with a slight risk for some isolated thunderstorms  which won t last too long  Highs 86 to 91 with cooler temperatures in the south coast Wednesday Night   An early evening thunderstorm otherwise clearing and turning drier by morning with lows in the lower 60s  Thursday   Sunny  with a high in the upper 70s  Friday   Sunny  with a high near 75  Winds will be light and humidity will be low  Saturday   Partly sunny  with a high near 80  Sunday   Warm and muggy with clouds and some sunny breaks  Showers possible with highs in the 80s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
198,A tranquil work week is ahead with just a brief interruption in the dry weather Tuesday night and the first part of Wednesday Today is going to be a nice day with plenty of sunshine  There might be some clouds west of Worcester  but sunshine will be the dominant weather feature  Highs will reach the lower 40s — perhaps mid 40s in a few spots  Winds are going to be very light Tomorrow  as a weather system moves into Quebec  some clouds and precipitation will move into New England  Eventually  towards the end of the daylight  some rain showers will cross  I don’t expect there to be heavy showers  but the Tuesday evening commute may be affected The middle of the week looks mild with a few showers  Highs will be in the 40s  The dry weather returns on Thursday with cooler conditions but nothing cold Over the weekend another potential coastal storm could bring significant amounts of rain and or snow to the region  It’s still too early to know whether this storm is white  wet or out to sea and I will have much more on this during the week Monday  Mostly sunny with a high near 40 Monday night  Partly cloudy with a low of 26 to 31 Tuesday  Early sunshine  then clouds and late day showers  Highs in the lower to mid 40s Wednesday  Morning showers  Otherwise lots of clouds and mild  Highs of 43 to 48 Thursday  Partly sunny with a high of 38 to 43 Friday  Partly sunny with a high of 36 to 40 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

200,Deep cold continues across the region Wednesday morning  with most areas seeing temperatures in the single digits  The wind won t be as bad as it was Tuesday  but it will still be a factor  Wind chills will be coldest through about 10 a m   especially west of Route 495  but no town is forecast to go below zero Sunshine will dominate the sky through Wednesday  but it’s still going to be very cold  with highs ranging from 15 in the Worcester Hills to 21 in Boston  to 28 on Nantucket  Another cold night follows On Thursday  we will begin to see a recovery in temperature readings  although we don’t go above freezing until Friday  The cold is tough and will take a southwest breeze to really dislodge it from the area  By Saturday  the air mass will completely change  Temperatures will be spring like  with highs nearing 50 in the afternoon  There will be rain showers moving through by night fall and if you are a Patriots fan  it looks like it could be a warm  windy and wet game Wednesday  Sunshine  Highs in the mid teens in northern Worcester County  low 20s in Boston and mid to upper 20s on the Cape and Islands Wednesday night  Partly cloudy  not quite as cold  Lows 5 to 15 and 20 to 27 on the Cape and Islands Thursday  Sunny again and slightly milder  Highs 25 to 30 and 31 to 34 on the Cape and Islands Thursday night  Increasing clouds  lows in the teens to mid 20s Friday  There could be a morning snow shower  otherwise lots of clouds and milder after noon  Highs 35 to 43 Friday night  Mostly cloudy lows in the mid 20s to lower 30s Saturday  Becoming cloudy  a shower possible during the afternoon  Mild  highs 47 to 52 Saturday night  Showers likely  could be some downpours  lows in the 40s Sunday  Showers ending  clearing and still mild  Highs 47 to 53 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
201,A big ocean storm is going to develop overnight and continue to gain strength on Wednesday  We will be on the western fringe of the storm so the impact to most of southern New England is going to be minimal However  over southeastern Massachusetts  Cape Cod and the Islands where the storm will be closer  more significant snow and wind is in store for the overnight hours and continuing into the first part of Wednesday There won’t be any snow Tuesday  just an increase in clouds  especially during the afternoon  It’s not going to be as cold as Monday with highs reaching into the 30s and nearing 40 The snow overspreads the south coast first late Tuesday evening and then slowly pushes west and north during the night The western extent of the snow Wednesday will determine how much snow you see  After sunrise  the snow will slowly begin moving eastward and ending  This will happen in Boston by noon and the extreme outer portions of Cape Cod and Nantucket late in the afternoon or early evening I expect the commute Wednesday to be slow in Boston with snow falling  and  if the storm gains enough strength  travel could become near impossible over parts of Cape Cod the first half of the day The combination of potential heavy snow and wind has prompted the National Weather Service to issue a blizzard warning for the Cape and the Islands Winds are going to be a factor along the coast and especially south and east of Boston  There could be some power outages over parts of Cape Cod and the Islands  I recommend preparing for a loss of electricity if you live along the immediate coastline Skies will clear late Wednesday night and leave us a sunny but breezy Thursday  Highs will reach the upper 30s and lower 40s for some melting of the snow Friday brings much milder air with a chance of showers and highs in the 50s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom This article was originally published on March 25  2014 
202,Steady snow has replaced the snow showers from earlier and up to 3 inches of snow could fall in heavier bands before noon  The snow is being caused by the arctic surge of air moving rapidly south as it clashes with the milder air from last evening  Additionally  there is leftover energy form the storm as it departs into Canada Roads will be very slippery for the next few hours as the amount of snow is slightly higher than earlier forecast  The heaviest snow will be north of Plymouth and back through the Merrimack Valley  The snow will end around noon Temperatures will hold in the lower 20s for most of the day  but it will feel like single digits with the added gusts of wind You may see a few breaks of sunshine today  but the clouds are going to be dominating  making it feel even colder Friday starts very cold  Later  afternoon highs will rebound in the upper 30s and lower 40s  It gets even milder on Saturday when highs reach the upper 40s to mid 50s More cold weather continues Monday with highs 15 degrees below normal  hitting 28 in Boston during the afternoon The next chance of a storm isn t until mid to late next week Thursday  Blustery and cold with any snow ending by mid to late morning  Highs in the low 20s but wind chill near 0 at times  Some breaks of sunshine developing in the afternoon  A coating to an inch of snow is likely  but a bit more could fall in isolated areas with heavier snow showers Overnight  Clearing and cold  Lows of 3 to 14 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 31 to 37 Saturday  Partly sunny with a high of 46 to 51 Sunday  Mostly sunny and seasonable  Highs in the mid to upper 30s Monday  Sunny and cold with highs of 28 to 34 You can follow David s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom This article was originally published on March 13  2014 
203,After a stellar weekend of a lot of sunshine and warm temperatures our luck continues for your Monday with a lot of sunshine and a continuation of warm and reasonably dry air  There is a bit of instability in the atmosphere this afternoon  so some of the growing cumulus clouds could yield a pop up thunderstorm for 10 minutes  but most of us stay dry Another comfortable night for sleeping is ahead with temperatures falling through the 60s during the overnight  This will set up another fine start to Tuesday  but our stretch of good weather is coming to an end briefly  You will notice humidity levels rising in the afternoon Tuesday with clouds increasing late in the day  I do expect rain showers to move in from the south on Tuesday evening and continue into Wednesday There are a few interesting aspects to this round of rain  First  the weather system causing the rain will be rather vigorous for early August  Second  the amount of rain could be quite heavy on the order of 1 to 2 inches  Third  there is significant energy with the system so thunderstorms  perhaps severe  might be an issue  More on that tomorrow The good news is the rain will not last long and by Thursday I expect the sunshine to return  The air mass behind this system is quite cool and while it won t be chilly  it s not going to be hot  As a matter of fact some areas will likely not hit 80 for several days Monday  Mostly sunny and warm  Highs in the lower 80s  cooler in the afternoon along the coast   Isolated showers and thunderstorms after 1 p m Monday night  Partly cloudy with lows in the mid 60s  cooler inland  Tuesday  Mostly sunny with clouds increasing late in the day  Highs near 80 Wednesday  Showers and thunderstorms with some downpours  Muggy with highs in the 70s Thursday  Partly to mostly sunny  Dry and comfortable with highs in the mid to upper 70s Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 75 to 80 Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
204,Humidity levels continued to go up overnight and today is looking similar to Monday in terms of temperatures but much more humid  The increase in moisture in the air will make it feel hotter than it has so far this summer  I think today will be the hottest feeling — and perhaps even the actual hottest — day so far  The high yesterday was 88 at Logan Airport with some towns nudging 90 or higher  We will see readings a degree or two warmer this afternoon I don t expect any showers this afternoon  and the only thing you might notice are some puffy clouds building to the west  Across northern New England there could be a pop up storm in the mountains Our tropical system off the southeast coast is still forecast to become stronger and will likely end up the first named system of the year  If the system reaches tropical storm strength it will become Arthur  The models keep this system far enough away to not impact southern New England directly  but we have to keep an eye on the track Wednesday night and Thursday  as a cold front moves in from the west  showers and storms will become more frequent  Wednesday is going to be particularly warm with still a lot of sunshine  If we see any storms they will likely hold off until sometime Thursday The best chance for wet weather comes Thursday night into the first part of Friday  As I wrote yesterday the exact timing of the end of the potential shower won t be known for a day or two  My best scientific estimate is that showers will end in time for evening activities on July 4 but could impact early morning activities  The big wild card is what happens in the middle It will clear and become noticeably drier for the weekend Tuesday  Mostly sunny  hot and more humid  Highs near 90 but cooler on Cape Cod Islands and south coast Tuesday night  Patchy fog near sunshine Very warm with lows near 70  upper 60s in some areas inland  Wednesday  Early fog at the coast but generally partly sunny  Highs of 88 to 93 Thursday  Lots of clouds as well as a few showers and storms  Highs in the mid 80s Friday  Showers and storms likely in the morning  Chance of showers after 5 p m  Highs in the upper 70s Saturday  Mostly sunny and pleasant  Highs in the mid 70s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
205,A very mild overnight means we will enjoy one more mild day today in spite of the fact colder air is spilling into the region  A cold front crossing southern New England will put an end to the two days of mild air and bring back the winter air for Tuesday Temperatures will reach their highs around or just after noon today and then fall back into the 30s by sunset  Eventually tomorrow morning all areas will be in the teens and 20s for a very chilly morning Dry roads mean no problems with icy conditions today or tomorrow Changes in the weather are going to be rapid this week  Tomorrow night warmer air will begin to flow north and this will bring a chance of some wintry precipitation inland late at night  Along the coast I am not expecting any issue  but there could be some slick spots for the commute Wednesday morning if you are coming in from the north or west to Boston  If there was any frozen precipitation it won’t last long as milder air pushes temperatures back into the 50s Thursday is a seasonable day with highs in the 40s  The weekend could be unsettled depending on how a potential storm unfolds  There are many possible scenarios from rain to snow and everything in between  I’ll have much more in the coming days Monday  A blend of clouds and sunshine with a brief  late morning sprinkle  Highs of 47 to 53 Monday night  Partly cloudy with a low of 17 in the colder spots to 25 in Boston Tuesday  Cold with sunshine giving way to clouds  Highs in the mid 30s Wednesday  Showers likely in the morning then some sunshine breaking through the clouds Thursday  Mostly sunny and seasonable  Highs in the mid 40s Friday  Mostly sunny and chilly  Highs in the mid to upper 30s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
206,It’s mainly a dry week ahead as southern New England sits between storms  Yesterday’s wind was thanks to a storm which gained strength as it pulled away into eastern Canada  Now  high pressure is building into the region and will keep us rain free nearly the entire time through Friday There might be a few sprinkles during the middle of the afternoon today and tomorrow  This morning we find breaks of sunshine between a mostly cloudy sky  Today will feature more clouds than sunshine and some of these clouds could build up enough to produce a quick shower or just a sprinkle  I don’t expect any showers as strong as Sunday’s Tuesday is a brighter day with more in the way of sun and fewer clouds  I left the chance of sprinkle in the forecast  but most of you won’t see them  It will be comfortably mild tomorrow with highs in the 60s  Winds will have decreased significantly from today Mid week is dry and mild before clouds and the chance of some rain arrive Friday night  There are several possible scenarios for the weekend weather so I’ll refrain from speculating at this point Monday  Clouds with periods of sunshine  Brisk winds with highs in the lower 60s  A quick shower possible Monday night  Partly cloudy with lows in the mid 40s Tuesday  Lots of sunshine with some mid afternoon clouds and a sprinkle in a few towns  Highs of 60 to 65 Wednesday  Sunny and pleasant  Highs in the mid 60s Thursday  Partly sunny with highs of 61 to 66 Friday  Lots of clouds and cooler  Highs in the upper 50s to lower 60s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

209,Wednesday s big ocean storm has departed and winds have subsided  It will still be a bit on the blustery side today  Temperatures this afternoon will be just under seasonal norms as clouds increase  Solar glare is an issue this time of year if you are headed into Boston from the west The end of the week and the weekend look unsettled  A weather system approaches from the west on Friday and brings with it a few showers  The overall balance of the day will be dry  with that chance of showers greatest in the afternoon Highs will be much milder Friday and it will feel a bit more like spring Over the weekend I will be tracking another coastal nor’easter  The good news is that is should be warm enough for rain from this storm although some mixed precipitation is possible away from the immediate coast  I don’t expect to see any accumulation or icing from this situation Snow isn’t the only hazard from the upcoming storm  Tides are running astronomically high this weekend and  if we see very heavy rain  street and stream flooding could be an issue  The heaviest ran would occur Saturday night or Sunday There are still some differences with the track and intensity of the storm on the models and these have implications for how much rain we see  when it starts and when it ends  I’ll have more tomorrow on the weekend storm Thursday  Morning sunshine then increasing clouds with highs in the upper 30s to lower 40s  Winds will still be brisk Thursday night  Mostly cloudy and not so cold  Lows around freezing Friday  Generally cloudy with a few afternoon showers  Breezy and mild  Highs in the lower 50s Friday night  Any showers end early  Then just cloudy with lows in the 30s Saturday  Cloudy with a period of showers or steady rain  Highs around 50 Sunday  A few showers and then a steady rain  The rain could be mixed with sleet to the north  Highs in the 40s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

211,Today has been my pick of the week since Sunday  and  although it s running neck and neck with Thursday  I am going to stand by my thinking  Today is going to be a great day partly because we are finally getting rid of the clouds and chance of showers which has plagued us since the weekend  Temperatures this afternoon will be in the 60s over most areas and even Cape Cod will reach the upper 50s Winds will be light and there might not be more than a cloud or two the entire day dotting the sky  Some areas can remain 100 percent cloud free all day  making for a perfect early May afternoon Tomorrow is almost a carbon copy of today  though  with a few clouds showing up in the afternoon  I still had to choose today  Temperatures continue to be similarly mild  On Friday a warm front  the leading edge of warmer and more humid air  will move closer to southern New England  As this front approaches so will clouds  and there is a slight risk of showers for Friday  Highs at the end of the work week will be in the upper 50s and lower 60s with the additional cloud cover On Saturday the front will move north  but clouds will remain in place  There could be a few periods of sunshine and temperatures will spike in the lower 70s  You ll also notice the air feels a bit more humid  although not uncomfortable Sunday may start with a few clouds  but Mother s Day is on balance a great day with lots of sunshine and warm temperatures Wednesday  Sunny and pleasant with highs in the mid 60s  upper 50s for Cape Cod  Wednesday night  Partly cloudy and not so cold  Lows of 38 to 46 Thursday  Mostly sunny with a high in the mid 60s but turning cooler along the coast in the afternoon Friday  Lots of clouds and a slight risk of a shower  Coolers with highs in the upper 50s Saturday  Lots of clouds and warmer  Highs in the lower 70s  60s on Cape Cod and the Islands  Sunday  A few early clouds then mostly sunny with highs in the lower 70s  60s on Cape Cod and the Islands  Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
212,Another fine day is on the way with plenty of sunshine and still low humidity levels  at least for most of the day  This is going to quickly change tomorrow and Thursday when the air becomes quite humid  Temperatures reach well into the 80s tomorrow but fall back a bit on Thursday due to the cloud cover It may be more uncomfortable that day as humidity levels will be so high  A few of your own personal thermometers might nudge 90 for a couple of hours on Wednesday  but I suspect the official Logan Airport reading to stay shy of that mark by a few degrees  As a weather system approaches from the north and west Wednesday night and Thursday  showers and thunderstorms will become increasingly likely  Some of the storms could produce very heavy rain and lightning Eventually later Thursday evening the front pushes eastward and drier air will replace the humidity  Currently  Friday and the weekend are looking quite nice with an abundance of sunshine and pleasantly warm temperatures Next week will start warm and the humidity will also increase again  There are some signs we might finally see a day or two of 90 degree heat as we close out the month of June and start July  I’ll have more confidence in this part of the forecast as we get closer to that period time A warm front will push north of the area later today ushering in a warm and humid air mass  A cold front will then push against this tropical air bringing the necessary forcing to produce showers and storms  The most likely time for these will be Thursday Tuesday  Mostly sunny and a bit more humid late in the afternoon  Highs in the lower and middle 80s Tuesday night  Mostly cloudy with a shower or storm over central and northern New England  Lows in the upper 50s to mid 60s Wednesday  Partly sunny and very warm  Highs of 84 to 88 but 70s over south coast and Cape Cod and the Islands Thursday  Showers and thunderstorms likely  Highs in the mid to upper 70s with very humid air Friday  Mostly sunny and less humid  Highs in the 70s Saturday  Mostly sunny and quite pleasant  Highs of 78 to 83  coolest on the immediate coast  Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
213,The storm is now mostly over with snow totals around 10 inches quite common in the Boston area  A few spots hit the 12 inch mark  while areas south of Boston seeing less snow As we head into Wednesday evening  light precipitation will continue in various forms  Most of the area will see spotty light snow or freezing drizzle and a bit of sleet  The light snow and sleet could accumulate a coating to an inch in the Boston area by midnight  This means when you finish clearing the walk or driveway this evening  there could be some additional precipitation to clean up come Thursday morning As temperatures fall below freezing overnight  any residual moisture will refreeze and slippery walking and driving will ensue Early Thursday  skies will clear and I am expecting lots of sunshine for the next three days  There will be some clouds mixing with the sunshine at times as temperatures remain cold  only reaching the upper 20s for the balance of the week The next storm threat is Sunday afternoon through Monday  There will be a big storm developing  However  the amount of snow could be near zero if the storm stays hundreds of miles off the coast or a much more significant storm if the track takes the system closer to the region  It’s still several days away and impossible to know at this stage Wednesday night  Light snow before midnight with a coating to one inch possible  Turning colder by morning with lows in the upper teens Thursday  Partly sunny with highs in the mid 20s Thursday night  Partly cloudy and cold with lows 10 to 15 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high in the upper 20s  Winds will be brisk Friday night  Partly cloudy and cold with lows 12 to 16 Saturday  Mostly sunny with highs 25 to 30 Saturday night  Mostly cloudy with lows in the teens Sunday  A chance of snow later in the day and at night Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom This article was originally published on February 05  2014

215,Enjoy the sun  it s going way for a while A nice recovery to temperatures will take place today after our cold start  With abundant sunshine  highs will reach well into the 50s  and a few towns southwest of Boston could nudge 60 for an hour or so  The majority of us will be in the middle to upper 50s  Winds will not be as brisk as Sunday and with lots of sunshine it will feel much better than the chilly afternoon yesterday A slow moving coastal storm  also known as a nor’easter  will bring inclement weather to the region for the Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday These types of slow moving systems usually have several periods of light rain or drizzle and a couple of times when it rains quite heavy  When the entire system is over we can expect to have seen 1 to 3 inches of rain across the region with the best chance of the heaviest amounts over the northeast part of the state and into southern New Hampshire  Cape Cod and the Islands will likely experience the least amount of rain  though it will be significant Winds will not be very strong for most of the storm  although we could see some stronger gusts from the northeast tomorrow and part of Wednesday   As the storm moves into the Gulf Of Maine at the end of the week the rain will become more showery and some clearing could take place Friday later in the day I think we really have to wait until the weekend before we see more sunshine and mild air   Sunday will still be dry  but much colder Monday  Mostly sunny and turning milder in the afternoon  Highs of 54 to 58 Monday night  Clouding up and not as cold  Lows of 40 to 45 Tuesday  Periods of rain  especially in the afternoon  Highs of 57 to 63 Wednesday  Periods of rain likely with highs in the upper 50s Thursday  Rain likely with highs in the upper 50s Friday  Lots of clouds and a few showers  Highs remain the upper 50s to near 60 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
216,We ve had three days in a row of cloudy  raw and wet weather  However  the good news is Friday should feature some sunshine  especially for those situated inland Some coastal areas could see some low clouds and even drizzle Friday morning  but these conditions should burn off later in the morning and early afternoon  The thickest clouds Friday morning are hanging over southeastern Massachusetts with many areas reporting clear skies  It’s cool with some inland areas near 40 The further west you are  the weather will be drier and sunnier  In areas with sun  temperatures will reach the mid and even upper 60s Friday afternoon  The clouds now over southeastern Massachusetts will move westward during the day so the morning will give the best weather before the day s end looks quite gloomy again Another system comes through Saturday with more clouds and some drizzle  There will be a period of heavier rain showers in the evening  but the bulk of the day will not see steady rain  even if it’s damp and somewhat raw  If you have outdoor plans and can muddle through with some drizzle  keep them in tact While I don’t expect a lot of rain  it will likely come down quite hard for a while Saturday  The good news is the system moves quickly enough and will clear out on Sunday for a great day with temperatures near 70  After nearly a week of cool damp air  the rise in temperatures is going to feel great The weather next week is looking quite nice as temperatures are seasonable or even a bit above normal  A few showers are possible in the middle of the week sandwiched between sunshine  Have a great weekend Friday  Mostly sunny  some clouds along the coast south of Boston  Clouds spread westward during the afternoon from the coast  Highs in the lower to mid 60s Friday night  Mostly cloudy with some drizzle towards dawn  Lows in the lower 50s Saturday  Lots of clouds  Highs in the mid 60s  Some spotty drizzle  but any steady showers hold off until near sunset Sunday  Mostly sunny highs in the mid 60s Monday  Mostly sunny  with a high near 70 Tuesday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Highs 68 74 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
217,A fine summer day is on the way with abundant sunshine  low humidity and coastal sea breezes  Highs today will be coolest at the coast and reaching into the upper 70s  but inland areas should make the lower 80s Dry weather will continue into much of the weekend  High pressure  which keeps things on the drier side  remains in place Saturday and through most of Sunday  Humidity will still be low through the weekend  however  by Sunday you will notice it starting to creep higher Unsettled weather is on tap for Monday and Tuesday as a slow moving systems brings showers to the area   By then  it will have been about 10 days since the last rain for much of the region  and so the water will be welcome  As the system is forecast to move slowly  there could be heavy downpours interspersed with these showers  But  the storms are still four days away making the details and timing of the rain uncertain During the middle of next week  the weather will once again turn warm and drier with humidity levels dropping  If all goes smoothly  we could have another nice weekend ahead next week Tides this weekend are running astronomically high  This is especially true Sunday around midnight and then again on Monday  There could actually be some splash over on some of the favored shore roads that see that type of situation  For most people  the biggest issue this presents will be a loss of space during high tide this weekend at their favorite beaches Friday  High clouds in the morning skies give way to mostly sunny and pleasant skies this afternoon  Highs 78 83 and warmest inland Friday night  Partly cloudy and comfortable  Lows 57 63 Saturday  Sunny and warm  Highs in the mid 80s with cooler temperatures on the Cape and the Islands Sunday  Sunshine followed by some afternoon clouds  Highs 80 85 Monday  More clouds than sunshine with a few showers  Muggy  Highs in the lower to mid 80s Tuesday  Lots of clouds and muggy  A period of showers  Highs around 80 Wednesday  Partly sunny and less humid  Highs in the lower 80s Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
218,A front pushed off the coast this morning and brought a few showers   The showers are over and we are left with a wonderful summer day of warm temperatures and decreasing levels of humidity  While the humidity went up yesterday  it will be going in the other direction today   It’s still going to be muggy this morning  but by 4 or 5 p m  you should notice a change in the air Temperatures are going to be quite warm this afternoon pushing up toward 90 degrees  Cape Cod will be cooler  but even there it’s a warm day  Highs over the Cape will be 78 to 84 depending on exactly where you are High pressure continues to dominate the weather the rest of the week and into the weekend with a fantastic stretch of weather  I expect lower levels of humidity during this period and seasonably warm temperatures  The nights will cool off sufficiently to allow for great sleeping weather as well The next chance for showers comes early next week  but this looks to be quick and light    Have a great day Wednesday  Mostly sunny and very warm  Turning drier during the afternoon  Highs of 85 to 90 Wednesday night  Partly cloudy with a low in the lower to mid 60s Thursday  Sunny and warm  Highs of 80 to 85 Friday  Sunny with a high near 80 Saturday  Mostly sunny with a high near 74 to 78  Temperatures will be warmest inland Sunday  Mostly sunny with a high near 75 to 80  Temperatures will be warmest inland Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
219,This week isn t going to be a warm and summery week like we just had  However  on balance  this is still going to be a good week of weather and great to be outside  The humidity levels will be comfortable and the nights will be good for sleeping Unless you have a very low tolerance for even one day of humidity  I feel you should be able to take out the window air conditioning units at this point in the month Sunshine prevails all day today after a coolish start to the morning  While certainly not frosty today  there is a frost advisory across northern Maine this morning  a sign of things to come A weak system passing to our south will bring some cloudiness to Cape Cod later Tuesday and early Tuesday night  Any significant wet weather should stay over the ocean  but there is a small risk of showers  Temperatures will be seasonable A bit of humidity arrives later Thursday ahead of our next weather system  Temperatures will moderate a bit prior to the weekend  Once the front passes however it will turn cooler and feel more like fall Saturday and Sunday  Many spots will stay in the upper 60s much of Saturday and Sunday afternoon  but with abundant sunshine it will be perfect for all outdoor activities  Have a great week Monday  Sunny and cooler with highs in the lower to mid 70s Monday night  Mostly clear with lows in the lower to mid 50s Tuesday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  A slight risk of showers  mostly south of the Mass  Pike  Highs of 70 to 75 Wednesday  Partly sunny with a high of 70 to 75 Thursday  Lots of clouds and milder  Highs in the mid to upper 70s Friday  Mostly sunny and warm with highs of 75 to 79 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
220,Several rounds of thunderstorms associated with some atmospheric energy brought damaging winds  hail and tornado warnings  Today will be a calmer day  but I can’t rule out the chance of a midday shower or thunderstorm  The graphic shows one radar forecast around noon Notice there are pop up showers and perhaps thunder over Worcester County  There is also a shower in the Boston area  These forecasts are not usually good at the exact location for storms  but do give the idea storms and showers might be possible There is another batch of thunderstorms that is more organized which will come through late at night  Because the timing is such that the showers are moving through at night  they might fall apart  so many us could escape overnight thunders Tomorrow  as a cold front moves by southern New England a final batch of storms will be generated  These will also be scattered and you may or may not see them  It’s just impossible to predict how many towns these pop up storm affect Once the showers depart very late Wednesday night  drier and more comfortable summer air returns to the region  Humidity levels will drop into the more comfortable range on Thursday along with cooler readings around the 80 degree mark  Right now the weekend is looking quite nice with abundant sunshine and seasonably warm air Tuesday  Mostly sunny and hot  A midday storm is possible  especially west of Boston  Still humid and breezy with highs in the lower 90s  but cooler on Cape Cod  the Islands and south coastal beach communities Tuesday night  Warm and muggy with late night thunderstorms in some areas  Lows of 68 to 71 Wednesday  Lots of clouds and some sun  Another chance for showers in the afternoon  Highs in the mid to upper 80s Thursday  Becoming mostly sunny and turning nicer  Highs of 79 to 84 Friday  Mostly sunny and pleasant  Highs near 80 Saturday  Mostly sunny with low humidity  Highs in the lower 80s  Cooler on Cape Cod and the Islands Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

234,If you see the sun this morning consider yourself fortunate  It’s not going to be back in earnest for most of this week  A strong nor’easter will move up the coastline late night through Wednesday  bringing with it a lot of wind and rain This is a slow moving storm and all of the details are not ironed out yet  but it is going to be too warm for a snow event in most of southern New England Today  as cold air rushes over the ocean  clouds will thicken and there could be some spotty snow  freezing drizzle or rain showers along the coast  This isn’t part of the nor’easter itself — rather a result of a moist fetch of air from an easterly flow of air Once the steadiest precipitation arrives late tonight and Tuesday  it will be too warm for snow  The commute this evening could be slick in a few places if the ocean effect snow becomes pronounced enough  but this shouldn t be significant Tuesday will be the wettest of the upcoming days  I expect both the morning and evening commute to be significantly impacted by rain  The rain will be combining with the wind to make traveling more difficult  While not snow  wet roads do impact travel As the low travels up the coast and moves beyond our area the rain will lighten up  This will happen late Tuesday night or early Wednesday  Then  late Wednesday another secondary low pressure system may bring more rain and perhaps inland snow back to the area  The second round of rain and snow isn’t as sure a bet as tomorrow’s event Monday  Some inland sunshine  coastal clouds and a few pockets of freezing rain and snow showers  Highs of 28 to 40 Monday night  Light  spotty precipitation becomes steady rain south of Boston by morning  Lows of 31 to 39 Tuesday  Rain and wind with highs in the 40s Tuesday night  Rain  tapering to showers by morning  Lows of 43 to 39 Wednesday  A chance of showers with highs in the mid 40s Thursday  Mostly cloudy and chilly  High near 40 Friday  Partly sunny with a high in the lower 40s You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

236,We missed the rain yesterday  and now it’s a continuation of the dry weather for the rest of the week and into the weekend  This pattern is beautiful to look at and enjoy  but we need rain High pressure will keep any significant amount of clouds and certainly any rain far from New England It’s not unusual to have dry weather like this in fall  but it’s been over 4 weeks since we had a widespread rainfall  and this is becoming an issue Since we can’t do anything about the lack of rain  however  we might as well enjoy it  The sunshine is going to be abundant through the weekend  The only real changes over the next few days involves temperatures Highs the next couple of days will be near 70 degrees  On Friday  a mass of cooler air will filter into the area and highs on that day will be only in the lower 60s There could be some frost in the interior valleys west of Rt  495 Saturday morning before sunshine boosts temperatures well into the 60s and near 70 degrees in the afternoon On Sunday  a southwest flow will bring back a summer like air  It won’t be humid  but it will be warm  A few areas will make a run at 80 degrees in the afternoon and with the sunshine it will actually be a great beach day A chance of a showers comes again on Monday — possibly in the evening — as cooler air moves back through New England to put an end to the summer air and return temperatures to September averages Wednesday  Sunny with a high near 70 Wednesday night  Mostly clear and cool with lows in the upper 40s to lower 50s Thursday  Sunny with a high near 70 Friday   Sunny  cooler than the previous few days  Highs in the lower 60s Saturday  Mostly sunny with highs around 70 Sunday  Mostly sunny  with a high between 75 79 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
237,Clouds and some periods of snow showers or flurries are in the forecast through this evening  and although little accumulation is expected  there might be enough to leave a coating to an inch of new snow The highest probability of snow is north of Route 2  but this doesn’t mean it won’t snow elsewhere  Temperatures are going to continue to be cold  Highs today will still remain in the upper 20s and lower 30s  about the same as yesterday  It will likely feel colder with all the clouds As a front passes through this evening  the snow showers will end and clearing will ensue   The evening commute could be slippery in those areas that see the heaviest snow showers pass  but I’m not expecting any widespread issues Dry and cold weather continues the rest of the workweek with a trend toward milder air over the weekend  Saturday could see readings in the mid 40s in a few places with most areas at least nearing the 40 mark We look to remain storm free into much of next week  with the next chance of anything significant a week away Wednesday  Lots of clouds  A few scattered periods of flurries or snow showers  A coating to an inch in some places  Highs of 28 to 33 Wednesday night  Any snow ends early and then clearing and blustery  Colder by morning  Lows of 5 to 15 Thursday  Sunny and very cold  Highs in the 20s Friday  Mostly sunny and noticeably milder with highs of 34 to 39 Saturday  Mostly sunny with a high near 40 to 45 Sunday  Partly sunny with a high near 36 to 41 
238,The low pressure system moving up the coastline Wednesday evening is bringing with it a variety of weather  Rain is falling along the immediate coastline and Cape Cod  Along the Interstate 95 corridor  snow and sleet are the main precipitation types  Central and western Massachusetts are bearing the brunt of the storm in terms of snowfall totals Warmer air at about 10 000 feet is going to push the sleet line westward during the evening  This means areas that have seen snow during the afternoon will mix with and even change to sleet  Between 7 and 10 p m  Wednesday there will be a dry slot of air which will shut the precipitation down completely in some areas In the hours just before and after midnight  as the storm pulls away  there could be a brief burst of snow in the Boston area  This is when any accumulation of snow will occur at Logan Airport — there could be a coating to an inch during this time With temperatures below freezing Thursday morning you should watch out for slippery spots on the roads  walkways and other surfaces The balance of Thanksgiving will be cloudy and cold and there could be a snow or rain shower  but nothing significant Sunshine returns for Friday and Saturday along with winter cold  A moderating trend arrives for Sunday  with highs into the 40s and lower 50s Wednesday night  Rain  snow and sleet ending as all snow before dawn  Becoming windy  Lows 28 to 33 Thursday  Mostly cloudy and cold  A rain or snow shower possible  Highs 35 to 41 Friday  Partly sunny and cold  Highs in the mid 30s Saturday  Partly sunny  highs 34 to 39 Sunday  Partly sunny with a high 45 to 52 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom This article was originally published on November 26  2014

240,There won t be any significant sunshine through most of this week as several weather systems bring clouds and rain to the area Today is cloudy with some light snow or rain showers  No matter what falls it won t amount to much  Early today  where it s below freezing there could be some icy spots on the roads  I suspect towns will treat them if needed Overnight  as some moisture moves up from the south  there might be some snow or freezing drizzle west and north of route 495  but again this isn t a widespread event  The theme this week is mild so wintry type travel will be isolated at best  and  once we get beyond Tuesday morning  that s it for the risk of any icy travel anywhere in southern New England Overall  Tuesday is cloudy and milder with a period of rain in the morning and then again at night  If you are traveling around New England there could be some icy spots over interior areas of Maine Tuesday afternoon and night As a large storm moves into the Great Lakes on Wednesday  Christmas Eve it will drag unusually mild air up from the south along with periods of tropical showers and perhaps even a thunderstorm  The steadiest rain will fall in the afternoon Christmas Eve and overnight  There could even be the rumble of thunder Christmas Day will be very mild and showery in the morning  but trending drier  but still with a lot of clouds in the afternoon Sunshine finally returns for Friday and the start of the weekend Monday  Cloudy and damp with a few rain or snow showers  Highs in the mid 30s to lower 40s over Cape Cod Monday night  Late night rain and snow showers with some freezing rain possible along the New Hampshire border  Lows of 30 to 39 Tuesday  Cloudy with a period of rain in the morning and then again late at night  Highs in the 40s Wednesday  Morning showers  then a period of rain  Rain may be heavy at times with highs of 55 to 60 Wednesday night  Showers with a low around 52  Chance of precipitation is 90 percent Thursday  Showers in the morning  Cloudy with fewer showers in the afternoon  Highs in the mid 50s Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 45 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
241,The week isn’t looking like a washout but there are showers in the forecast for the next several days  Wednesday is the only day this week when there isn’t really a chance of any rain  The best chance for rain is Thursday What you will notice today and tomorrow is that clouds build up during the morning  There could be a shower before noon  but most of the shower activity comes after 2 p m  You might even hear the rumble of thunder if some of the showers grow in size enough Showers will tend to end and die out as the sun sets each evening  Temperatures will be about average for the time of year  neither cool nor hot  but mostly in the upper 60s to around 70 As the system bringing the showers moves east Wednesday there will be more sunshine that day  It won’t last however as a new system brings a renewed opportunity for rain on Thursday lingering into Friday morning Right now the timing of this system is such that it will leave the area for the holiday weekend  I’ll update the forecast for the weekend during the week  This week’s showers won’t seem to bad if we end up with a nice three day weekend ahead  Stay tuned Monday  Morning sunshine and clouds with a few showers possible by mid morning and more likely this afternoon  Highs in the mid to upper 60s Monday night  Any showers and thunderstorms end during the evening  Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s Tuesday  Clouds and sunshine once again ending with a chance of showers and a thunderstorm  Highs in the 65 72 range Wednesday  Partly sunny and pleasant  Highs of 68 to 74 Thursday  Showers likely and possibly a thunderstorm  Cool with highs of 58 to 64 Friday  Lots of clouds and still the chance for a shower  Highs in the upper 60s Weekend  Drier and turning milder Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

243,After one of the more milder Christmas days on record  temperatures will return to levels still above average  but not at near record levels  If you are headed to do some returns or looking to spend that favorite gift card  today the roads will be dry and winds will be much lighter You won t need a heavy coat with temperatures running about 10 degrees above seasonal averages  On Thursday afternoon  a few spots southwest of Boston could nudge 50  but everyone else will be in the 40s  Overnight   coast readings should stay above 32 degrees Saturday is my pick of the next 7 days and could be one of the last really nice days for a while  Highs will reach the 50 degree mark in many spots and it s going to be a super day to finish up any outdoor work you might have missed last month  The ground isn t frozen so you could even plant a few bulbs On Sunday  a cold front will cross the region and mark an end the mild weather  Highs will still hit the 40s  but there won t be as much sunshine and there is a risk of a few showers  It does turn quite a bit colder by Monday and Tuesday  I don t see any snow as we start January  but it will feel more like winter Friday  Sunny  with a high 44 49 Saturday  Mostly clear  lows range from 30 36Sunday  Morning sunshine  then a period of clouds and possible showers in the afternoon  Highs in the 40s Monday  Morning sunshine  then a period of clouds and possible showers in the afternoon  Highs in the 40s Tuesday  Mostly sunny  cooler  Highs 35 40 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
244,The weather this weekend was dry  but rather cool for the end of August  Our final week of the month is going to change that as we have at least a few days of above average temperatures We find high pressure building south of New England today and this will create a southerly flow of warm and eventually somewhat humid air  The most humid if the next three days will be Wednesday afternoon when the dew points will reach the mid 60s and  combined with the temperatures in the upper 80s  will make it feel like one of the hotter days of the summer Neither the heat nor the humidity is going to last very long  Later Wednesday a cold front will pass through and could kick off a shower or thunderstorm  Many areas will stay dry although we need some rain Thursday the sunshine returns and it will be drier once again  The nice weather continues into the weekend which is amazingly Labor Day weekend  Because Monday is the 1st  this is the earliest Labor Day weekend can be  Next year it s Sept  5 7  as late as it can be Tropical Storm Cristobal continues to move north far off the Florida coastline  While this storm is forecast to become a hurricane  nearly all the models keep this storm from becoming an issue to the United States  When the storm does pass the area late this week  there could be some large ocean swells  More on this in the coming days  Have a great week Monday  Mostly sunny and warmer  Highs in the mid 80s  cooler at the Cape Islands  Monday night  Mostly clear and comfortably cool  Lows of 58 to 63 Tuesday  Sunny and warm  Highs of 84 to 88  cooler at the Cape Islands  Wednesday  Sunny and very warm  A pop up  late day storm possible  Highs of 85 to 90 Thursday  Mostly sunny and still nice with a high near 80 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 75 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom 
245,Day three of a sunny holiday weekend is underway after a cold start  Temperatures early this morning were in the lower 30s with another frost for a lot of folks Strong April sunshine will help to boost temperatures into the upper 60s inland  Along the coast this afternoon a sea breeze will hold those highs in the upper 50s and lower 60s   Residents along coastal roads could see readings fall 5 to 10 degrees as winds turn easterly bringing back a bit of a chill If you are running or watching  the biggest issue will be the strength of the sun  After a long winter  there will be some sunburned folks by the end of the day Overnight it will be clear and not as cold as the past few nights  As a cold front approaches the region on Tuesday clouds will increase although the first half of the day looks to be mostly sunny  Showers are likely overnight and a few front running rain drops could occur over western areas before sunset Any rain is over by Wednesday morning with a return to a blend of clouds and sunshine for the balance of the day  It will be cooler from the middle of the week through Fridaywith highs mostly in the 50s  It will turn milder later Friday with highs nearing the lower 60s We may see some more April showers to start the weekend  but at the present time Saturday doesn’t look like a washout Monday  Sunny with highs in the upper 60s inland but upper 50s along south  and east facing coastal areas Monday night  Partly cloudy and not as cold  Lows in the lower 40s Tuesday  A blend of clouds and sunshine  Mild with a chance of late day showers  Highs of 65 to 70 Tuesday night  Showers likely  especially before midnight  Lows in the 40s Wednesday  Partly sunny and cooler  Highs of 54 to 58 Thursday  Sunny with a high of 55 to 60 Friday  Mostly sunny with a high near 56 to 62 You can follow David’s weather updates on Twitter at  growingwisdom

247,Another winter storm began to hit New England with snow Saturday afternoon  The storm is expected to bring strong winds and blizzard conditions near the Massachusetts coast The Boston area faces a winter storm warning and could get anywhere from 5 to 9 inches of snow The National Weather Service has issued a winter blizzard warning for Cape Cod and the Islands  as well as the coastal areas of Essex and Plymouth counties Meteorologist David Epstein told WBUR how many inches to expect On the Cape  the precipitation is going to start as rain and that will affect snow totals Epstein said once we get through this storm there is a bit of a silver lining 
248,Our winter storm is moving up the coastline today and will bring a wide variety of precipitation to the area  The storm has three distinct parts to it and each will be different This morning some Massachusetts areas may experience some snow that will then quickly change to rain  especially along the coastline south of Boston Across Cape Cod and the Islands look for rain  heavy at times to continue after the change and street flooding may be a problem in some areas During the afternoon the rain snow line will push west through Boston and continue westward past route 495 after 3 p m  It is during this time snow will stop accumulating for most areas east of Route 495 and south of the Massachusetts Turnpike While the heaviest of the precipitation will be ending  there will still be a period of sleet and freezing rain over interior sections  This will coat any new snow with a layer of ice The first half of the night will see some light rain  sleet or freezing rain  Late at night an area of backlash snow will move eastward  and across northern Worcester County and the Berkshires there could be a few inches of new snow  In the metro Boston areas  there may be a coating and up to an inch of snow  This could impact the Friday morning commute Winds will be strongest this afternoon along the coast where wind advisories are placed over Cape Cod and Cape Ann  During the overnight  winds will diminish  There will be some minor splash over of the waves along parts of the coast and some beach erosion as the tides comes in at around 10 p m Any snow ends early Friday followed by lots of sunshine  Another very large storm moves by to the east of New England Saturday and brings clouds and the chance of light snow with it  especially along the coast  This doesn’t look to be anything more than a dusting at this stage Cold and dry weather returns for Sunday with a warm up next week  though more rain and snow will threaten the area Friday  Cloudy with a drizzle this morning and a period of showers and heavier downpours later this afternoon and evening  Thunder is possible  Highs just over 50 south of Boston and in the 40s north of the city Friday night  Rain ends early  then skies clear  Lows will be in the upper 20s to near 32 degrees Saturday  Sunny with highs in the mid 40s Sunday  Mostly sunny with some clouds late in the day with a rain or snow shower at night  Highs between 40 44 degrees Sunday Night  A few snow showers and turning colder  Lows between 20 25 degrees Monday  Mostly sunny  but cold with highs between 28 31 degrees Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom 
249,Over the next four days  stormy weather is heading into the area There is a chance of thunderstorms Thursday afternoon  However  the day isn t a total wash — it will feel like a great summer day without humidity or intense heat The thunderstorms will occur because some energy appears to be crossing the region later this afternoon  with the best odds of getting caught in a storm occurring in the western part of this region  including Merrimack Valley and possibly  parts of the north shore Boston  as well as the South Shore and the Cape and the Islands are not very likely to see more than a few big clouds this afternoon On Friday  more energy will cross the region  Friday s system isn’t as strong as Thursday s storm  so it isn t expected that any storms will be as strong  However  there is still the risk of a more stubborn storm  but that risk is mostly only substantial for those west of Route 95 As I wrote Wednesday  the weekend is not likely to be very sunny and has the potential for rain  I don’t see the whole weekend being a washout  but it won’t be rain free either A storm front that passed the region earlier this week will back up from the ocean and pull tropical moisture into the area  The exact configuration of the front  the extent it moves west  and how long it stay in one position are going to determine just how many of this weekend s hours will see rainfall The system could back in so far that the majority of the rain drops down over western areas  Right now  it appears more likely to rain Saturday than Sunday  Clouds will dominate both days  but by Sunday we could see a few breaks It’s impossible to tell exactly what time it’s going to rain in your town this weekend  So keep a radar app handy and follow my updates on Twitter through the weekend  growingwisdom Next week will be sunnier  but a few days will also run the risk of drawing in pop up storms Thursday  Mostly sunny and comfortably warm  Highs around 80  There might be a few storms in the afternoon west of Route 495 Thursday night  A few clouds and comfortably cool  Lows in the upper 50s to lower 60s Friday  Sunshine followed by a few building clouds  A quick hitting thunderstorm late in the day is possible  A bit warmer  Highs in the lower 80s Saturday  Cool and cloudy  A chance of some rain  mostly south of the Massachusetts Turnpike  Highs in the lower to middle 70s Sunday  Clouds and some periods of sunshine  A few showers  Highs 73 78 Monday  Partly sunny and pleasant   Highs in the upper 70s  Slight risk of a shower Follow updates from David Epstein on Twitter  growingwisdom

447,A white man who joined a prayer meeting inside a historic black church and then fatally shot nine people was captured without resistance Thursday after an all night manhunt  Charleston s police chief said Dylann Storm Roof  21  spent nearly an hour inside the church Wednesday night before killing six women and three men  including the pastor  Chief Greg Mullen said  A citizen spotted his car in Shelby  North Carolina  nearly four hours away The chief wouldn t discuss a motive  Charleston Mayor Joseph P  Riley Jr  called it  pure  pure concentrated evil   Stunned community leaders and politicians condemned the attack on The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church  and Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Justice Department has begun a hate crime investigation President Barack Obama  who personally knew the slain pastor  state Sen  Clementa Pinckney  said these shootings have to stop Pinckney  41  was a married father of two who spent 19 years in the South Carolina legislature  He became the youngest member of the House when he was first elected as a Democrat at 23 The other victims were identified as Cynthia Hurd  54  Tywanza Sanders  26  the Rev  Sharonda Singleton  45  Myra Thompson  59  Ethel Lance  70  Susie Jackson  87  the Rev  Daniel Simmons Sr   74  and DePayne Doctor  49 The shootings took out the heart of a community — civic leaders including three pastors  a regional library manager  a college enrollment counselor  and a high school track coach — and left the historic church with just one living minister Wooten said autopsies would be conducted over the next several days and did not have specific information on how many times the victims were shot or the locations of their injuries Roof waived extradition from North Carolina Thursday and was taken to a waiting police car wearing a bulletproof vest  with shackles on his feet and his hands cuffed behind his back Roof s childhood friend  Joey Meek  alerted the FBI after recognizing him in a surveillance camera image  They recognized the stained sweatshirt he had been wearing while playing Xbox videogames in their home But Roof had been to jail  court records show a pending felony drug case and a past misdemeanor trespassing charge  And he proudly displayed the flags of defeated white ruled regimes  posing with a Confederate flags plate on his car and wearing a jacket with stitched on flag patches from Rhodesia  which is now black led Zimbabwe  and apartheid era South Africa Meek said they had been best friends in middle school  then lost touch for years until Roof reappeared a few weeks ago Roof wasn t known to the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery  Alabama  and it s not clear whether he had any connection to the 16 white supremacist organizations operating in South Carolina  but he appears to be a  disaffected white supremacist   based on his Facebook page  said the center s president  Richard Cohen Charleston authorities put out photos of the suspect from the church s surveillance camera early Thursday  Later that morning  authorities west of Charlotte  North Carolina  got a report of a sighting of the suspect s car headed west  said Jeff Ledford  the police chief in Shelby  North Carolina  Officers pulled over the driver and arrested Roof just before 11 a m   about 14 hours after the attack A gun was found in the car  Mullen said The shooting evoked painful memories of other attacks  Black churches were bombed in the 1960s when they served as organizing hubs for the Civil Rights movement  and burned by arsons across the South in the 1990s  Others survived shooting sprees This particular congregation  which formed in 1816  has its own grim history  A founder  Denmark Vesey  was hanged after trying to organize a slave revolt in 1822  and white landowners burned the church in revenge  leaving parishioners to worship underground until after the Civil War This shooting  should be a warning to us all that we do have a problem in our society   said state Rep  Wendell Gilliard  a Democrat whose district includes the church   There s a race problem in our country  There s a gun problem in our country  We need to act on them quickly  NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks said  there is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people  A few bouquets of flowers tied to a police barricade outside the church formed a small but growing memorial The attack came two months after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man  Walter Scott  by a white police officer in neighboring North Charleston  which increased racial tensions  The officer awaits trial for murder  and the shooting prompted South Carolina to pass a law  co sponsored by Pinckney  to equip police statewide with body cameras Contributors include Alex Sanz  Meg Kinnard and David Goldman in Charleston  South Carolina  Jay Reeves in Birmingham  Alabama  Eric Tucker in

640,One hundred Boston police officers are now equipped with body cameras as they carry out their duties  That s after a judge s ruling Friday cleared the way for a delayed body camera pilot program — long pushed by local activists — to finally launch Here are 10 things to know about the pilot program 1  What is it The program is a six month pilot to test out body worn cameras on Boston police officers  Dr  Anthony Braga  who heads the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University  will analyze the effectiveness of the program by looking at police and community interactions  citizen complaints  use of force incidents and community satisfaction  Two companies — Taser and Vievu — have been contracted for the pilot  The city has allotted $500 000 for the program 2  Who is participating in the pilot program After no officers volunteered  Braga selected 100 to participate in the pilot  The group is diverse and comes from five sections of the city and the department’s Youth Violence Strike Force  According to the department  55 are white  29 are black  13 are Latino  and three are Asian  And 87 of the 100 officers are men Also  Police Commissioner William Evans announced last week that eight members of his command staff will wear body cameras for the duration of the pilot program  However  those commanders will not officially be part of the study group for the pilot program 3  How will the body cameras be used According to the department s policy guidelines for the program  officers will only turn on the cameras while conducting official law enforcement duties  They will record all contact will civilians — such as during vehicle stops  when responding to a call  or while searching an individual  The cameras aren t to be deactivated  until the encounter has fully concluded and or the officer leaves the scene   The policy gives officers discretion not to record in some instances where there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy — like locker rooms  hospitals or places of worship  And officers must get consent to record inside a person’s private residence if they don’t have a warrant  or during a non emergency situation The policy also allows officers to view the body camera footage prior to writing police reports and in some cases before making a statement about an incident  That part of the policy has drawn criticism from activists and community members Read the full policy 4  How do the body cameras actually work The cameras attach to the front of an officer s uniform and have an on off switch  They begin recording when they are activated  Boston police will be using two types of body cameras  one from Taser and one from Vievu  Superintendent In Chief William Gross  one of the commanders who will wear a body camera  showed me his device at a recent peace walk in Roxbury  His model is from Taser and uses cloud storage while Vievu uses  an external storage device that s kept at the station   Gross said His body camera has an app to manage the footage   It stores the video and you tag it and say what incident had just occurred and then it goes to the cloud   Gross said   You can t alter it  you can t send it to YouTube  you can t touch it  It s all administrators  that  can only touch that     Related  Here  amp  Now  Taser On How Body Cams Work And Storage5  Why is the city doing a body camera pilot program The point of the pilot is to see whether citywide implementation of body cameras would work in Boston  In the wake of several high profile police shootings  body cameras have been part of a larger national conversation around police community relations  Many see them as a part of 21st century policing  In Boston  activists and community groups have been pushing for body cameras since 2014  following the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson  Missouri  The technology has already become a reality for many police departments across the country  And in Massachusetts  several communities have been testing them out 6  There s been a lot of talk about body cameras in Boston for a while  Why is the pilot just now getting off the ground  There was a lot of back and forth between the city and the union  and the matter ended up in court  The Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association claimed the city violated an agreement to do a voluntary program by assigning body cameras to officers and filed an injunction seeking to halt the program  The city said it had the authority to assign cameras after no officers volunteered  A judge sided with the city in a ruling that gave the program the green light to move forward Before that  though  the pilot program had been in the works since last September  In April  there were plans to launch the pilot in July  That was delayed as the city and union negotiated  They reached a deal in mid July  But by August no officers volunteered  so the police department assigned cameras  The plan was to start the pilot at the beginning of September  But  as explained above  the union took the matter to court 7  Are there pilot programs in other cities Yes  Several cities across the country have pilot programs  including New York  Los Angeles and Chicago  And Los Angeles plans to make body cameras more widespread   Here’s a report that looks at pilot programs in 50 cities  Police in New Orleans  Albuquerque and Rialto  California  are already fully equipped with body cameras  And cities like Minneapolis  Baltimore and Seattle are equipping their entire police force iteratively  In Massachusetts  several local communities  like Worcester  Leicester  Methuen and Gill  have tested out and in some cases fully implemented body cameras 8  Will body cameras be fully implemented in Boston after the pilot program That’s unclear  A decision on whether to fully implement body cameras in Boston will be made at some point after the pilot program is complete  That will likely be  as soon as the research is done and Anthony Braga provides a report   Boston police spokesman Lt  Michael McCarthy said In an interview  Commissioner Evans said he ll make a recommendation and the department will have to work with the city and city council around a budget to move forward 9  What will happen with all that video footage from the pilot program The video footage will be stored two ways — through cloud based storage and by the two companies  Taser and Veivu  the city has contracted to do the pilot program — according to police spokeswoman Myeshia Henderson 10  What does the research say about body cameras There s still much to learn about body cameras Some studies have found body cameras significantly reduce the number of complaints against police and incidents of police use of force  For example  a 2014 U S  Department of Justice report cited two studies  One found the Rialto  California  police department had a 60 percent reduction in officers using force and an 88 percent reduction in complaints against police  The other found 75 percent fewer use of force complaints against police in Mesa  Arizona  A study of Orlando police had similar findings Other studies have looked at the limitations of body cameras  noting murky policies and inconsistencies in how body cameras are used In Boston  the police department often emphasizes community policing  saying it has strong community relations  There has been some concern raised about how the body cameras may change how the public interacts with police  e g   people not wanting to speak to police because of the body cameras  During the court hearing over the Boston pilot program  the police union suggested cameras may cause people to react negatively toward officers  The union cited a study by the Rand Corporation that found some officers faced increased risk of assault while wearing cameras  The report notes other possible reasons for that result and says  much more work is needed to unpick the reasons behind these surprising findings   Evans — and  ultimately  the judge — expressed skepticism about the results of the Rand report 
641,The city announced Tuesday evening that they had come to an agreement with a police union  bringing Boston one step closer to implementing a body camera pilot program  This comes after renewed calls by local activists in recent days following the high profile police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana The police department reached an agreement with the Boston Police Patrolmen s Association  BPPA  to equip up to 100 patrol officers with cameras for a six month pilot  but there is still no timeline for when it will launch Participation in the program would be voluntary  which has been a point of criticism from many who have been pushing for body cameras  And according to the agreement  officers who do participate in the program will receive $500 compensation at the completion of the program The agreement also offers parameters for viewing the body camera footage  Officers involved in a shooting or other use of deadly force cannot view the footage before an investigations unit has done so  Involved officers and officers who are witnesses can then view their own footage prior to giving a statement or walkthrough  An investigations unit will be responsible for collecting and uploading all body cam footage  In other instances  officers can view their own footage when they are completing an investigation  before a court appearance  to refresh recollection   and when giving a statement regarding an internal investigation And  according to the agreement  the Boston Police Department would reopen negotiations with the union if they decide to expand the use of body cameras after the pilot program is complete Boston police will now work to identify officers that will participate in the pilot program Tuesday s agreement is a step toward launching the program  but a final policy for the pilot still needs to be developed  The city says that policy is currently being worked on Some say the police department has been moving too slowly Last September  the Boston Police Department said it would launch a body camera pilot program  Then in April  Boston police offered a few more details  saying it would equip 100 officers across the city with body cameras as part of a six month pilot program set to begin in July Now  almost halfway through the month  it is unclear exactly when the body camera pilot program will get off the ground When asked at the end of last week what was holding up the program  police said they were still working out details with various unions There are also a number of policy issues to consider when it comes to body cameras  such as when the cameras will be turned on and off  how the video will be stored  as well as how to handle various privacy concerns when interacting with the public  On Saturday  Mayor Marty Walsh said these are among the issues the city is looking at as it develops its pilot program Walsh said body cameras are coming to Boston in the  near future   but said he had no timeline for exactly when Police Commissioner Bill Evans told WGBH Tuesday that he hopes the pilot program will begin in August  He also said he would like to see body cameras become permanent after the program BPCAT is demanding that process move more swiftly BPCAT formed in 2014 after the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson  Missouri  and since then has been pushing for body cameras in Boston  Idowu said his organization wants to be proactive and not wait until similar incidents happen in Boston On Monday  the Boston chapter of the NAACP also renewed calls for the city to roll out body cameras  Michael Curry  the chapter s president  said Boston needs to lead on the issue of body cameras  which he said provides  a two way benefit  And some see this technology as an important part of addressing police community relations  Idowu said while body cameras are  a smaller piece of the larger puzzle   they are a necessary step in tackling issues of accountability and policing This article was originally published on July 12  2016

648,Video of a deadly encounter between Charlotte police and a black man shows his wife repeatedly telling officers he is not armed and pleading with them not to shoot as they shout commands to drop a gun The New York Times posted the video  recorded by the wife of 43 year old Keith Lamont Scott  on Friday  The 2 minute video does not show the shooting  though gunshots can be heard His wife tells officers at the scene that he has a traumatic brain injury  At one point  she tells her husband to get out of the car so that police don t break the windows  As the encounter escalates  she tells them repeatedly   You better not shoot him  Warning  The video contains graphic content and language After the gunshots are heard  Scott can be seen lying on the ground while his wife says  he better live   She continues recording and asks if an ambulance is called as officers stand over Scott  It is not clear if they are checking Scott  who appears to be laying on his chest  for weapons or attempting to render aid The video was posted after a third night of protests over the shooting gave way to quiet streets as a curfew enacted by the city s mayor ended early Friday The largely peaceful Thursday night demonstrations in the city s business district  watched over by rifle toting members of the National Guard  called on police to release video that could resolve wildly different accounts of the shooting of a black man earlier this week  Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Friday that there is footage from at least one police body camera and one dashboard camera The family of Keith Lamont Scott  43  was shown the footage Thursday of his fatal shooting and demanded that police release it to the public  The video recorded by Scott s wife had not been previously released Demonstrators chanted  release the tape  and  we want the tape  Thursday while briefly blocking an intersection near Bank of America headquarters and later climbing the steps to the door of the city government center  Later  several dozen demonstrators walked onto an interstate highway through the city  but they were pushed back by police in riot gear Charlotte is the latest U S  city to be shaken by protests and recriminations over the death of a black man at the hands of police  a list that includes Baltimore  Milwaukee  Chicago  New York and Ferguson  Missouri  In Tulsa  Oklahoma  on Thursday  prosecutors charged a white officer with manslaughter for killing an unarmed black man on a city street last week Thursday s protests in Charlotte lacked the violence and property damage of previous nights  and the curfew encouraged a stopping point  Local officers  ranks were augmented by Guard members carrying rifles and guarding office buildings against the threat of property damage Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts signed documents Thursday night to be in effect from midnight until 6 a m  each day that the state of emergency declared by the governor continues After the curfew took effect  police allowed the crowd of demonstrators to thin without forcing them off the street  Police Capt  Mike Campagna told reporters that officers would not seek to arrest curfew violators as long as they were peaceful So far  police have resisted releasing the footage of Scott s death  Putney said Friday that releasing it could inflame the situation and damage trust in the community  He has said previously that the video will be made public when he believes there is a  compelling reason  to do so Roberts said during that same news conference that  I do believe the video should be released  The question is on the timing  Earlier in the week  the Charlotte protests turned violent  On Wednesday  demonstrators attacked reporters and others  set fires and smashed windows of hotels  office buildings and restaurants in the city s bustling business district Forty four people were arrested after Wednesday s protests  and one protester who was shot died at the hospital Thursday  city officials said police did not shoot 26 year old Justin Carr  Putney said Friday that video led investigators to a suspect who was arrested  but he provided few other details Police have said Scott was shot to death Tuesday by a black officer after he disregarded repeated warnings to drop his gun  Neighbors  though  have said he was holding only a book  The police chief said a gun was found next to the dead man  and there was no book Putney said he has seen the video and it does not contain  absolute  definitive evidence that would confirm that a person was pointing a gun   But he added   When taken in the totality of all the other evidence  it supports what we said  Justin Bamberg  an attorney for Scott s family  watched the video with the slain man s relatives  He said that in the video  Scott gets out of his vehicle calmly Scott was shot as he walked slowly backward with his hands by his side  Bamberg said The lawyer said at a news conference earlier in the day that Scott s wife saw him get shot   and that s something she will never  ever forget   That is the first time anyone connected with the case has said the wife witnessed the shooting  Bamberg gave no details on what the wife saw The police chief acknowledged that he has promised transparency in the investigation  but said   I m telling you right now  if you think I say we should display a victim s worst day for consumption  that is not the transparency I m speaking of  Associated Press writers Mitch Weiss  Seanna Adcox  and Jeffrey Collins in Charlotte  North Carolina  Gary Robertson in Raleigh  North

677,Black men who try to avoid an encounter with Boston police by fleeing may have a legitimate reason to do so — and should not be deemed suspicious — according to a ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Citing Boston police data and a 2014 report by the ACLU of Massachusetts that found blacks were disproportionately stopped by the city s police  the state’s highest court on Tuesday threw out the gun conviction of Jimmy Warren Warren was arrested on Dec  18  2011  by police who were investigating a break in in Roxbury  Police had been given a description of the suspects as three black men — one wearing a “red hoodie ” one wearing a “black hoodie” and the other wearing “dark clothing ” An officer later spotted Warren and another man  both wearing dark clothing  walking near a park  When the officer approached the men  they ran  Warren was later arrested and searched  No contraband was found on him  but police recovered an unlicensed  22 caliber firearm in a nearby yard  Warren was charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and later convicted In its ruling  the court made two major findings  The justices said police didn’t have the right to stop Warren in the first place  and the fact that he ran away shouldn’t be used against him On the first point  the court said the description of the break in suspects’ clothing was “vague ” making it impossible for police to “reasonably and rationally” target Warren or any other black man wearing dark clothing as a suspect  The court said the “ubiquitous” clothing description and the officer’s  hunch  wasn’t enough to justify the stop On the second point  the court noted that state law gives individuals the right to not speak to police and even walk away if they aren’t charged with anything  The court said when an individual does flee  the action doesn t necessarily mean the person is guilty  And when it comes to black men  the BPD and ACLU reports “documenting a pattern of racial profiling of black males in the city of Boston” must be taken into consideration  the court said The SJC concluded that police lacked reasonable suspicion for an investigatory stop in this case Matthew Segal  the legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts  called the decision  a powerful ruling  that demonstrates what role courts can play in addressing community concerns about policing The ACLU s report found that between 2007 and 2010  63 percent of Boston police encounters were with blacks  though at that time the city s black population was just 24 percent  Notably  the report said that taking into account high crime neighborhoods did not explain the disparity Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans blasted the SJC ruling and said he was  troubled  the court cited the ACLU report  which he called  heavily tainted against the police department  The SJC ruling also cited the Boston Police Department s own analysis  which found blacks were 8 percent more likely to be stopped repeatedly and 12 percent more likely to be searched and frisked even when controlling for factors like criminal history  gang affiliation and violent crime areas Evans said the department s report found there was no indication of bias  The department s report did outline steps to ensure fair stops  including increased training on racial profiling and unconscious bias The SJC ruling comes a week after the launch of a long awaited police body camera pilot program in Boston    a program many  including Segal  see as a positive step toward police accountability and transparency  Body cameras have been part of a larger national conversation on policing since the 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson  Missouri  and other high profile police shootings of unarmed black men across the country WBUR s Delores Handy contributed reporting

olla  Dice que se lo mandaron de Guatemala  “Especial para el frío” La mujer sirve el chocolate en una taza encima de su comedor donde reposa una foto en blanco y negro de su padre  Manuel Tzoc Ixcotoy  Él es uno de las más de 200 000 personas asesinadas en el conflicto armado de Guatemala que duró de 1960 a 1996 El hombre que ella cree responsable de la muerte de su padre  Juan Alecio Samayoa Cabrera  vive a menos de una milla de su casa en Providence Esta mujer y otros tres familiares de personas asesinadas en la guerra civil en Guatemala hablaron con WBUR bajo condición de anonimato  Ella teme que aliados de Samayoa puedan ir tras sus hijos  acá en los Estados Unidos Las autoridades guatemaltecas dicen que están esperando a Samayoa con una orden de captura en conexión con crímenes cometidos durante el conflicto armado Expedientes judiciales muestran que Samayoa tiene 67 años  es padre de ocho hijos  y ha vivido en Providence como inmigrante indocumentado desde los años noventa  La policía de Providence dice que Samayoa no tiene historial criminal en la ciudad  donde es dueño de una casa de tres apartamentos en la avenida Webster  y acorde a varios testimonios  ha trabajado como jardinero Al final de octubre oficiales del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas  ICE  arrestaron a Samayoa por violaciones migratorias—25 años después de que entró ilegalmente a los Estados Unidos desde Guatemala Después del arresto de Samayoa  WBUR hizo varias solicitudes de entrevista a su familia y a su abogado  Ni Samayoa ni sus  familiares quisieron dar declaraciones Mientras su proceso de deportación continúa  Samayoa permanece en custodia de ICE en el centro de detenciones de Bristol County en Dartmouth  Massachusetts ‘Usted es muy famoso’ en GuatemalaLa mujer de Providence dice que se enteró por casualidad que vivía en la misma ciudad que el hombre que ella cree mató a su padre  Mientras esperaba en la fila de una farmacia Walgreens  reconoció la cara de Samayoa y su sombrero negro  Afuera de la tienda lo confrontó Ella es una mujer de origen indígena Maya  un grupo que sufrió a principio de los años ochenta lo que es generalmente considerado como un genocidio  Para los proponentes de la guerra fría  no se trataba de genocidio  sino de lucha contra el comunismo Muchos guatemaltecos en New Bedford y Providence provienen del departamento El Quiché  de la región montañosa al oeste del país  Fue en Quiché que Samayoa  bajo su propia admisión  dirigió una unidad paramilitar de 500 hombres durante la guerra  Era parte de la Patrulla de Autodefensa Civil  que fue documentada como responsable de múltiples asesinatos extrajudiciales  incluyendo la muerte del padre y tío de la mujer de Providence El gobierno de Guatemala le entregó a WBUR un expediente judicial con alegaciones contra un supuesto cómplice de Samayoa  Cándido Noriega  En 1999  Noriega fue condenado en Guatemala por seis asesinatos y dos homicidios  y fue sentenciado a 220 años de prisión  En el expediente  Samayoa es mencionado junto a Noriega  acusado de estar involucrado en 38 asesinatos y decenas de secuestros  entre otros crímenes llevados a cabo en 1982 y 1983 Esto fue en la cúspide del  genocidio   dirigido por el entonces presidente Efraín Ríos Montt  quien legalizó la patrulla de Autodefensa Civil— que acabó con la vida de más de 100 000 indígenas Maya  En el caso de Samayoa  las acusaciones incluyen entierro de personas vivas e incendio a viviendas  El expediente sugiere que a una de las víctimas le arrancaron los ojos de su cabeza Un hombre que se mudó recientemente a New Bedford desde Guatemala dice que su padre fue asesinado en Quiché en 1982  El hombre  que también pidió ocultar su identidad por miedo a retaliación  dice que recuerda cuando Samayoa y su patrulla entonces vinieron por su padre El hombre de New Bedford dijo que el grupo de Samayoa lo dejó solo pero se llevó a su padre  Manifestó que después le dijeron que a su padre lo habían matado en un barranco En noviembre en una audiencia de fianza en la corte de inmigración de Boston  Samayoa apareció vía circuito cerrado de televisión desde la cárcel de Dartmouth  Parecía encorvado y serio  como si acabara de salir de la cama  Diez indígenas Mayas vinieron  algunos para testificar en contra de Samayoa  pero el abogado de Samayoa no estaba presente y la audiencia fue aplazada Una semana y media después  más de 20 amigos y familiares de Samayoa llegaron para apoyarlo en la corte  Pocos indígenas estaban presente  Su abogado dijo que quiere que su cliente sea puesto en libertad mientras el proceso de deportación continúa Pero Jennifer Mulcahy  abogada de ICE  argumentó que Samayoa no debería recibir fianza debido a las “violaciones de derechos humanos” en su propio país  Presentó un documento gigantesco para apoyar su caso  Parece ser la primera vez que alegaciones de derechos humanos en contra de Samayoa son presentadas en una corte de los Estados Unidos La defensa de Samayoa recibió un aplazamiento para estudiar el caso y la próxima audiencia es a mediados de Diciembre Después del juicio  la esposa e hija de Samayoa rehusaron hablar Luego de que le preguntaron si era la primera vez que escuchaba sobre las violaciones a los derechos humanos por parte de Samayoa  su abogado Hans Bremer dijo en inglés  “Yo no voy a comentar sobre eso  Lo siento” Esta no es la primera experiencia de Samayoa con el sistema migratorio  Expedientes judiciales indican que presentó una petición de asilo a principio de los años 2000  y detalló su versión de cómo llegó a los Estados Unidos Escritos en inglés  los documentos indican que Samayoa “tenía buenos ingresos” vendiendo ganado y madera en Guatemala  Además  “tenía varios empleados  era dueño de tierra y un carro y tenía dinero de sobra” Samayoa dijo que tomó las armas en defensa propia y en apoyo al ejército  En 1982 empezó a comandar la unidad paramilitar local en la municipalidad de Chinique  y luego se unió al ejército como reclutador de jóvenes cadetes Sin entrar en detalles sobre sus actividades como líder paramilitar  Samayoa dice que los guerrilleros lo atacaron varias veces  y que una vez pasó tres días en coma Después de dejar el hospital en 1992  Samayoa huyó de Guatemala y entró a los Estados Unidos ilegalmente  Su petición de asilo fue negada por las cortes y permaneció viviendo en Providence por trece años antes de que ICE lo arrestara el Octubre pasado Personas familiares con el caso confirman que ICE y el Departamento de Justicia estaban investigando a Samayoa por lo menos hacía tres años atrás Doyle indica que Samayoa es uno de los más de 1 900 sospechosos de ser violadores de derechos humanos que viven en los Estados Unidos  y que unidades especiales del Departamento de Justicia y ICE los están investigando La principal fiscal de derechos humanos de Guatemala  Hilda Pineda  dice que oficiales esperan a Samayoa para arrestarlo y acusarlo luego de su deportación Pineda señaló que los fiscales quieren que Samayoa sea enviado a Guatemala  para que puedan hacer su trabajo Algunos guatemaltecos acá en Nueva Inglaterra no le tienen fe al sistema de justicia de su país  Hace pocos años  las cortes anularon un veredicto en contra del más notorio autor del genocidio en Guatemala  El octogenario expresidente Efraín Ríos Montt Sin embargo  defensores de derechos humanos en Guatemala dicen que las cosas han cambiado  Apuntan a varias sentencias a criminales de guerra como evidencia de que habrá justicia para las víctimas de Juan Samayoa Para que Samayoa llegue a una corte de Guatemala  ICE tiene que deportarlo primero  y el proceso puede durar meses o tal vez años Con la foto de su padre en su comedor  la mujer Guatemalteca en Providence está observando y esperando

820,Lea la versión de este reportaje en español Maria del Carmen Villeda was willing to deal with working conditions that a former immigration agent likened to an industrial era sweatshop  Her children back in Honduras relied on the money she sent home  and her mother was sick and in need of medications But Villeda s life turned upside down one freezing morning 10 years ago  on March 6  2007  when Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  raided the plant that employed Villeda and hundreds more people in the country illegally Ten years have passed since ICE raided the Michael Bianco Inc  textile plant  While Bianco’s owner and several managers were arrested  361 workers were detained in one of the largest immigration raids in a single location in U S  history The raid was based on an ICE investigation that alleged the company had “knowingly and specifically been hiring large numbers of illegal aliens   The agent in charge at the time said it was the largest immigration raid in the history of the state — involving some 300 ICE agents in addition to an array of local  state and federal agencies At the time  Bianco Inc  was a recipient of Department of Defense contracts  making gear for American soldiers  Former ICE officials said they believe the order to arrest all of the undocumented workers came from the highest levels of government Of 361 workers  immigration attorneys estimate that 150 were deported  At least a handful  including Villeda  would return to the city Thirty three years old at the time  Villeda found a hiding spot under a table in the factory  She says six hours passed before ICE agents found her Villeda was deported to Honduras  but it would only be a matter of time before she would return to New Bedford  A Humanitarian Crisis Corinn Williams  executive director of the Community Economic Development Center in New Bedford  says the raid resulted in a  community wide trauma  that’s felt to this day  She says it took a long time for some of the Bianco workers who were released to feel safe leaving their homes and sending their kids to school Williams referenced the current climate surrounding immigration  adding   It was a really  really devastating part of our local history  and hopefully we won t return to those times  A video posted on YouTube shortly after the raid shows Gloribell Mota holding a sick baby  Mota  who spoke with WBUR about the video  was among the volunteers who flooded into New Bedford after the raid  helping to care for children who’d been separated from their parents Federal authorities involved in the raid say they made every effort to prevent children from being abandoned  Ultimately  as many as 90 parents were released to care for their dependents Bruce Foucart was special agent in charge of Homeland Security investigations in New England  the top guy in the orchestration of the raid Many think ICE could have done more to help in the aftermath of the raid  Then Gov  Deval Patrick called it a “humanitarian crisis ”Patrick declined to comment for this story  but his Department of Social Services chief  Harry Spence  recalled the impact on children who were separated from their parents Foucart had a special connection to the Bianco raid  He was raised in the neighborhood where the factory was located  He says he d go back and do the raid all over again if he had to But he has one regret   The failure to come back to New Bedford two or three days later and continually answer questions to the community  to priests  to politicians  It was almost as if we did what we had to do … and we took our ball and went home ” Foucart said   We failed to answer  and because we failed to answer these pertinent questions about where their loved ones were going  it created a vacuum  And what happens in a vacuum  Falsities occur  people start making stuff up  Foucart says rumors of abuses on the part of ICE agents were unfounded Former ICE agent Eric Caron  also a New Bedford native  said he led the investigation into the Bianco company Caron emphasized that the Bianco raid was a matter of national security Albert Orlowski is a retired deportation officer who immigrated from Poland as a child and grew up in New Bedford  He says he and his fellow ICE agents were told not to make any vacation plans the week of the Bianco raid Orlowski qualifies the operation as a sweeping success  and says the best part was that nobody got hurt  Asked if he has a sense of remorse about helping deport so many people  Orlowski shook his head  Workers Now Know Their Rights On a recent weekday evening  a group of workers from a local fish factory discussed what they called bullying and discrimination by their employers  and what steps to take to defend themselves  They gathered at the Centro Comunitario Trabajadores  or Community Workers Center  a group founded in the aftermath of the Bianco raid Ventura is a member of the Maya Quiche people  Working without legal status at a textile plant in New Bedford  Ventura said he was fired the day of the Bianco raid because his employers thought they could be targeted next  Ventura said his wife was also fired from a textile factory shortly after the raid Hearing helicopters in the air the day he was fired  Ventura left his job for the last time  running to the Bianco factory to see what was going on Ventura said it brought him back to the Guatemalan civil war he lived through in the 1980s   The immigration police left me completely in shock ” he said in Spanish  describing the day of the raid  “I didn t want to see them because they arrived with weapons  and this was the trauma that I came with from Guatemala    the bombs  the helicopters  the guns  I hated it  But now  10 years later  he says the raid had a galvanizing effect on the community Ondine Sniffin was the first immigration attorney to arrive at the factory the day of the raid  She said politicians stood up to help reunite families    but 10 years later  it s the people who also stand up  I Had To Come Here After the raid  Maria del Carmen Villeda was jailed for three months before being deported  Back in Honduras  she said she found herself in poverty and menaced by violence    the same situation that caused her to leave her five children and travel north in the first place  Only now  Villeda said  the gangs were reaching new levels of brutality  She said they killed multiple family members and kidnapped her son Villeda applied for a visa but was denied  so she decided to return to the U S  in September 2015 without papers and turn herself in to immigration authorities to request asylum  Officers put a monitor around her ankle  and she said she s had it on ever since Now  Villeda has little recourse but to pray her asylum request will be granted Correction  An earlier version of this story misspelled Ondine Sniffin s last name  We regret the error  This article was originally published on March 06  2017 This

821,Massachusetts  highest court ruled Monday that local law enforcement officials do not have the authority  under state law  to detain a person based solely on a request from federal immigration authorities The landmark decision by the Supreme Judicial Court was hailed by immigrant activists and state Attorney General Maura Healey  who called it  a victory for the rule of law  In ruling on the Lunn v  Commonwealth case  the high court concluded that state law  provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer  beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody  The detainer is a request from U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  to hold a person in custody whose criminal proceedings have been settled and who is otherwise free to go  This could mean the individual s charges have been dismissed  they ve posted bail  or their jail sentence has been completed The detainer    which is not the same as an arrest warrant  which requires proof of probable cause and a judge s signature    gives ICE up to two days to look into a person s immigration status and potentially pursue deportation C M  Cronen  who s the ICE field office director in Boston  disagrees In a statement  he said the ruling  weakens local law enforcement agencies’ ability to protect their communities   Cronen added that ICE is reviewing the decision to determine next steps U S  Attorney General Jeff Sessions  the nation s top law enforcement officer  has argued that detainers give federal immigration officials a chance to investigate a person s immigration status while keeping criminals off the streets And Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson  who takes a hard line on immigration enforcement  said the  decision makes Massachusetts residents and visitors more vulnerable to become victims of crime  But Emma Winger  an attorney who represented Lunn before the SJC  said that concerns about public safety are not relevant The SJC s decision explained how Sreynoun Lunn  who was first ordered deported back in 2008  came to be at the center of this case Lunn was arraigned in the Boston Municipal Court on October 24  2016  on a single count of unarmed robbery  The day before the arraignment  the United States Department of Homeland Security     issued a civil immigration detainer against him  The detainer document     requested  among other things  that the Massachusetts authorities continue to hold Lunn in State custody for up to two days after he would otherwise be released  in order to give officers of the department time to arrive and take him into Federal custody Lunn has been in federal immigration custody several times since 2008  He was most recently held as a result of the ICE detainer mentioned in the SJC s decision  He remained in custody for more than three months as immigration officials attempted to deport him However  because Lunn was born to Cambodian parents in a Thai refugee camp  neither nation recognizes him as a citizen  Both nations have refused to take him  preventing the U S  from deporting him to either place Lunn  who s 32  was then released from federal custody in June after lawyers argued he was being held without due process Eva Millona  director of the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition  said Monday s ruling  provides much needed clarity for Massachusetts law enforcement  That was echoed by Chelsea Police Chief Brian Kyes Bristol Sheriff Hodgson says he s teaming up with several state representatives to draft new legislation in response  James Lyons  a Republican state representative from Andover  says he s hoping to get a new statute on the books Lyons and his co sponsors hope to file the new bill this week But for now  the SJC s decision is the law statewide Susan Church  a former head of the New England chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association  says this Massachusetts ruling could provide a roadmap for other states With additional reporting by WBUR s Benjamin Swasey and the Newscast UnitThis article was originally published on July 24  2017 This segment aired on July 25  2017

from Guatemala  “special for the cold ”She poured the steaming chocolate into a mug on her kitchen table  where she keeps a black and white portrait of her father  Manuel Tzoc Ixcotoy  He’s one of some 200 000 people killed in Guatemala’s armed conflict  from 1960 to 1996 And the man she believes is responsible for her father s death  Juan Alecio Samayoa Cabrera  lives less than a mile from her home in Providence This woman    and three other local Guatemalans related to people killed in the war    spoke to WBUR on condition of anonymity  She fears allies of Samayoa could come after her children  here in the United States Authorities in Guatemala say they are waiting for Samayoa with an arrest warrant in connection with crimes committed during the armed conflict Court records show the 67 year old Samayoa is the father of eight  and had been living in Providence as an unauthorized immigrant since the 1990s  Providence police say he has no criminal record in the city  where he owns a triple decker on Webster Avenue  and according to various accounts has worked as a landscaper In late October  officers from U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him for immigration violations    a quarter century after he first came to the States illegally from Guatemala After Samayoa s arrest  WBUR made repeated attempts to interview him through his family and his lawyer  Samayoa and family members declined to comment While his deportation case proceeds  Samayoa is in ICE custody at the Bristol County House of Correction in Dartmouth  Massachusetts  You Are Very Famous  In GuatemalaThe Providence woman said she found out by pure chance she was living in the same city as the man she thinks killed her father  Waiting in line at a Walgreen s pharmacy  she recognized Samayoa s face and black sombrero  Outside the store she confronted him The Providence woman is an indigenous Mayan  part of a group that suffered what is widely seen as a genocide in the early 1980s  For some cold warriors of the time  it wasn’t about genocide  but a war against communism Many Guatemalans in New Bedford and Providence come from the Quiche region in the country’s western highlands  It was there that Samayoa  by his own admission  led a paramilitary unit of 500 men  The unit was part of Guatemala’s Patrulla de Autodefensa Civil  which was documented as carrying out scores of extrajudicial killings  including the murder of the Providence woman’s father and uncle The Guatemalan government provided WBUR with a court document containing allegations against Samayoa s alleged accomplice  Candido Noriega  In 1999  Noriega was convicted in Guatemala of six murders and two cases of manslaughter  and sentenced to 220 years  In the document  Samayoa is named alongside Noriega  accused of involvement in 38 murders and dozens of kidnappings among other crimes carried out in 1982 and 1983 That was at the height of a genocide    headed by President Efrain Rios Montt  who legalized the Patrulla de Autodefensa Civil    that claimed the lives of well over 100 000 indigenous Maya  In Samayoa’s case  the accusations include burying people alive and torching their homes  The court document suggests one of the victims had his eyes ripped out of his head A man who recently moved to New Bedford from Guatemala says his father was killed in Quiche in 1982  The man  who also asked that his name not be used for fear of retaliation  said he remembers when Samayoa and his patrol came for his father The New Bedford man said Samayoa s group left him alone but took his father away  He said he was later told that his father had been killed in a ravine Immigration CourtIn mid November  at a bail hearing in immigration court in Boston  Samayoa appeared via closed circuit TV from the Dartmouth jail  He was slouched and serious and looked like he d just gotten out of bed  Ten Mayans came  some prepared to testify against him  but Samayoa s lawyer was not present and the hearing was continued A week and a half later  20 of Samayoa s friends and relatives showed up to support him in court  Just a few Mayans were there  Samayoa s lawyer said he wants his client released while the deportation case proceeds But an attorney for ICE  Jennifer Mulcahy  argued Samayoa should not get bail because of “human rights violations in his own country ” filing a mammoth document to support the motion  It appeared to be the first time human rights allegations have been filed against Samayoa in an American court Samayoa s attorney received a continuance to study the filing  and the next date was set for mid December After the hearing  Samayoa s wife and daughter declined to speak Asked if this is the first he s heard about human rights violations by Samayoa  his attorney  Hans Bremer  said  “I m not going to comment about that  so  I m sorry ” The Theater For Horrific Violence This is not Samayoa’s first time in immigration proceedings  In court documents filed in his asylum claim during the early 2000s  Samayoa detailed his version of how he got to the United States The records suggest Samayoa “made a good living” selling cattle and wood in Guatemala  “had several employees  owned land and a car  and had plenty of money  Samayoa claimed he took up arms in self defense  and in support of the military  In 1982 he began leading his local paramilitary unit in the municipality of Chinique  and he later joined the military as a recruiter of young cadets Without going into the details of his activities as a paramilitary leader  Samayoa claimed the guerrillas attacked him several times  and that he once spent three days in a coma  After leaving the hospital  in 1992  Samayoa fled Guatemala and entered the U S  illegally  His asylum claim was denied by the courts  and he stayed in Providence another 13 years before ICE arrested him in October People familiar with the case confirm ICE and the DOJ were investigating Samayoa going back at least three years Doyle notes that Samayoa is one of more than 1 900 suspected human rights violators living in the U S  And special units at the Department of Justice and ICE are going after them Justice In GuatemalaGuatemala’s top human rights prosecutor  Hilda Pineda  said officials there are waiting to arrest and charge Samayoa once he’s deported Pineda said prosecutors want Samayoa to be sent to Guatemala  so they can do their job  “We want him to be sentenced based on the facts ” she said But some Guatemalans here in New England lack faith in the justice system in their country  Just a few years ago  the courts overturned a guilty verdict against perhaps the most notorious author of Guatemala s genocide  the octogenarian former President Efrain Rios Montt Advocates in the country  however  say things have changed They point to recent convictions of Guatemalan war criminals as evidence there will be justice for the victims of Juan Samayoa For Samayoa to make his way to a Guatemalan courtroom  ICE must first deport him  and that could take months  if not years With a picture of her father on her kitchen table  the Guatemalan woman in Providence is watching and

848,For Marilyn Morrissey and her husband John  the new Our Lady of Good Voyage shrine symbolizes not just the Catholic faith  but the South Boston waterfront culture they grew up in The Morrisseys now live in Randolph  But they ve watched the transformation of the Seaport over more than a half century The Southie natives were among more than 200 people who attended Mass on Sunday at Our Lady of Good Voyage  the first newly built Catholic church in Boston for some 65 years  The shrine replaces a chapel of the same name — that building was razed recently to make way for a yet another towering Seaport development The new shrine is an ode to the churches that closed before it  The altar windows are made from stained glass from the former parish of St  Catherine of Siena in Charlestown  the main altar comes from the former Holy Trinity church in the South End  and the cross atop the bell tower comes from the former Mary Star of the Sea church in Quincy Since the 1970s  the Archdiocese of Boston has closed more than 150 churches  according to a spokesman  New churches have opened in Dracut and Plymouth over the last decade  but the Seaport shrine is the first newly built church in Boston since 1952 Souza is assigned to the new shrine and other churches in South Boston  He said he s been ordained for about four years  and previously worked in Billerica Souza says the original Our Lady of Good Voyage chapel was built to serve workers on the waterfront The shrine is brimming with symbols of the Our Lady of Good Voyage tradition  which stretches back not only to Portugal and Spain  but also here in Gloucester  where a church of the same name opened in the late 19th century Six model ships line the shrine s walls — including one of the USS Constitution and another of the Boston Lightship — and the structure of the roof invokes the carpentry used to build wooden ships of old This segment aired on April 24  2017

852,A case before the state s highest court Tuesday could determine just how much local law enforcement are legally allowed to cooperate with federal immigration agents The case  Commonwealth vs  Lunn  asks the Supreme Judicial Court  SJC  to decide whether local law enforcement are authorized to detain a person solely at the request of U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  An ICE detainer is a request to hold a person in custody whose criminal proceedings have been settled  meaning the charges have been dismissed  they ve posted bail  or their jail sentence has been completed  A detainer gives ICE up to two days to look into a person s immigration status and potentially pursue deportation In Sreynuon Lunn s case  larceny charges against him were dropped by a district judge  ICE  however  had issued a detainer requesting the court hold Lunn  even though his criminal charges were cleared and he was otherwise free to go  The judge ordered Lunn detained and he was taken into ICE custody And this is where the constitutionality of ICE detainers comes into play Kyes is following the hearing before the SJC and hoping the court will hand down clarification when it comes to the role of local law enforcement in fulfilling ICE detainers An ICE detainer is not the same thing as an arrest warrant  which requires proof of probable cause and sign off from a judge  legally empowering police to detain a person  ICE detainers  on the contrary  are voluntary requests coming directly from ICE On its website  ICE argues that when local police or courts decline to hold someone on a detainer  the safety of the community is jeopardized U S  Attorney General Jeff Sessions  the nation s top law enforcement officer  says the use of detainers is a common practice And that s the way it works with criminal cases  But immigration law is civil in nature  which means different rules apply One of the lawyers arguing on behalf of Lunn  Emma Winger  says the federal government s public safety logic is also problematic Winger said this case isn t about who ICE can and cannot deport  Instead  Winger is arguing that when local police and courts honor detainers — holding someone for civil immigration reasons at the request of ICE — they are actually violating a person s constitutional liberties She said this is especially relevant given the new enforcement priorities from President Trump The ACLU of Massachusetts filed a brief in this case  arguing that it s unconstitutional for local authorities to hold someone based solely on an ICE detainer The group s legal director  Matthew Segal  says holding someone without oversight from an independent judge can lead to mistakes Jacinta González is one of those U S  citizens  She s also an immigrant rights advocate living in Phoenix  She says that she was held in custody last year on an ICE detainer when she refused to answer questions from immigration agents  Eventually  ICE confirmed she was a citizen and told her to leave the office The decision by the SJC could have national implications  There are similar cases across the country looking at the constitutionality of local police and courts enforcing ICE detainers Attorney General Maura Healey s office is arguing on behalf of the state and the Suffolk County sheriff  both parties to the Lunn lawsuit In a statement  Healey s office said ICE detainers are voluntary under state law  and courts and police may not detain people based solely on a request from ICE The statement added   There are many ways in which state and local enforcement agencies can and do work with the federal government to protect against individuals who pose a risk to public safety  This segment aired on April 4  2017

866,Yusuf Alptekin is a slender man with deep set eyes  His government issued blue jumpsuit signals to guards and other prisoners at the Bristol County House of Corrections that the 53 year old is a low threat detainee Still  the door to the office we re sitting in needs to stay open for security purposes  and guards stand just outside Alptekin prefers to speak in English rather than through an interpreter   I like to live in safe place  that s why I chose this country  Because I m really honored to  be in  this country  because I really enjoy it all my 10 years   he says with a smile Alptekin was one of five people arrested by U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  agents last month in Lawrence while they were attending scheduled appointments at a U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  office All five of those arrested  including Alptekin  had final orders to be deported  but were beginning the process of gaining legal permanent residency  ICE confirmed that none of those arrested has a criminal record  Why I m Here  Alptekin left Izmir  Turkey  for the United States in 2007  He says his family was being threatened there by a terrorist group looking for retribution against him because of his work as a drug informant for the Turkish government He entered the country on a travel visa and spent some time in Florida looking for work  When he got word from his brother that the family was in danger  he went back to Turkey Alptekin says it was safer for everyone in his family if they split up  After about a month in Turkey he returned to the U S  on another travel visa  He tried applying for asylum in Canada but was told he needed to go back to the U S  to file for asylum  While he was detained in Canada  his U S  travel visa expired  Upon reentry into the U S   he was arrested by ICE officials and sent to a detention facility in Batavia  New York Alptekin applied for asylum while in custody  representing himself at the hearing  A U S  immigration judge denied his asylum claim  citing a lack of sufficient evidence to back up Alptekin s claim that he and his family were in danger in Turkey  Alptekin s appeal was dismissed in 2010 and he was ordered to leave the U S  within 60 days  Alptekin says he feared for his safety in Turkey  and chose to stay For the last seven years  he s lived largely under the radar — cooking and training chefs  opening new restaurants with friends  and doing odd jobs  He s started a whole new life With his hands folded on the table  Alptekin s face brightens when he mentions his wife Michelle  whom he met in Northborough  and some of the things they enjoy together  They Blew It Before When They Broke The Rules Immigration lawyers say last month s arrests in Lawrence signal a distinct shift in enforcement priorities under President Trump  Under President Obama  someone with no criminal record  but who did have orders of removal  was not considered as high of a priority for deportation as a

902,The USS Constitution  the world s oldest commissioned warship still afloat  has returned to Boston s waters The undocking of  Old Ironsides  on Sunday marked the end of restoration work that started two years ago  officials said  A celebration was held at the USS Constitution Museum The wooden ship was launched in 1797 and earned its famous nickname notching victories in the War of 1812 The restorations extend the life of the nearly 2 feet thick vessel — the last remaining survivor of six ships created when President George Washington signed the Naval Armament Act — said Margherita Desy  a historian at Naval History  amp  Heritage Command Detachment Boston A crowd of people gathered around the ship Sunday night to watch as the ship was floated off its blocks and into the harbor The ship enters dry dock about every 20 years for below the waterline repairs  The most recent work included replacing 100 hull planks and installing 2 200 new copper sheets  500 of which were signed by nearly 100 000 museum visitors  according to USS Constitution Museum President Anne Grimes Rand  who called the ship  a wonderful symbol for our democracy  The Constitution entered the dock at the historic Charlestown Navy Yard on the night of May 18  2015  and on Sunday   a day that was expected to have the highest tide of the summer — the dry dock at the navy yard was flooded  and the ship was lifted off the keel block When the height of the water at the dry dock equaled the height of water at the Boston Harbor  the ship was slowly towed out of the dock The vessel will be temporarily docked at a nearby pier to undergo more restoration work until September  when it will re open for public tours More photos of the USS Constitution in dry dock  
903,Read this story in English here  Our full climate series is here El aumento del nivel del mar no es la primera preocupación de Dolores Rivas   es más como la sexta o la séptima  Pero viviendo en un desarrollo de viviendas cerca de la bahía en East Boston  la amenaza de calles inundadas nunca está demasiado lejos East Boston está en pleno desarrollo  pero sigue siendo uno de los barrios más diversos de la ciudad  La mitad de los residentes son Latinxs y más de 40 por ciento no dominan el inglés  Oficiales de la alcaldía dicen que quieren conectarse con personas como Dolores Rivas en su esfuerzo para defender a East Boston de las futuras inundaciones  que amenazan una gran parte del territorio del barrio  Pero incluso con la iniciativa Climate Ready Boston en plena marcha  Rivas no ha oído ni una palabra de parte de la ciudad ¿Cuáles Son Nuestras Posibilidades De Sobrevivencia El barrio de East Boston está rodeado de agua  y en términos geológicos  es un racimo de cinco islas que fueron rellenadas de tierra durante los tiempos industriales  En el caso de una inundación  el agua fluirá más o menos entre las islas Además  el barrio está rodeado por el Mystic River  Chelsea Creek y Boston Harbor  Para llegar por tierra al centro de la ciudad  hay que usar un puente o túnel  Eso les preocupa mucho a residentes como Sandra Alemán Nijjar Aún sin tormenta  Alemán Nijjar ya ha experimentado la sensación de un East Boston apocalíptico   con un atasco de tráfico  Su papá se enfermó y tuvieron que salir en una ambulancia  cuando se quedaron atascados en la entrada del túnel   Los paramédicos realmente se disculparon  ¿Pero una emergencia  una tragedia masiva ” dijo Alemán Nijjar  “Ay Dios mío  Sería una pesadilla horrible” En una reunión comunitaria para presentar la iniciativa de Climate Ready Boston  Nasser Brahim está parado a la par de un afiche con varias proyecciones del aumento del nivel del mar   la más grave muestra el aumento de más de 7 pies en Boston a finales del siglo  Brahim es planificador de cambio climático con la compañía Kleinfelder  la cual fue contratada por la ciudad para diseñar una defensa de tres millas de la costa de East Boston Segun Brahim  la amenaza del mar es algo que se puede solucionar con la ingeniería  La propuesta es un sistema de bermas y parques levantados que contendrían una marea alta durante una tormenta severa La planificación en contra de la elevación del mar está pasando a la misma vez que otro fenómeno está transformando a East Boston   la gentrificación  La costa está brotando con glamurosos desarrollos de viviendas que se están construyendo  y con más en camino  Según Brahim  están diseñados para  resistir las inundaciones  y los propios edificios sirven como barreras  Pero  ¿de que servirán cuando las calles se inunden Nasser Brahim dice que está claro  invertir en defensas contra inundaciones valdrá la pena La alcaldía estima que las inundaciones en East Boston podrían costar decenas de millones en daños a la propiedad y pérdida de productividad  Pero también podrían amenazar a las masas de personas que viven en el camino de inundación El informe sugiere que cerca de 300 residentes de East Boston ya están afectados por las inundaciones comunes  Y al fin del siglo  una extrema tormenta podría amenazar a casi la mitad de la población de más de 40 000 En Boston  las personas involucradas en la preparación para el cambio climático apuntan a huracanes como Sandy y Katrina  que motivaron a Nueva York y Nueva Orleans a planificar las defensas costeras  En cambio  Boston está comenzando a planear antes de que ocurra un desastre Pero las defensas costeras son sólo una parte de la infraestructura de mitigación de inundación  Los urbanistas quieren abrir acceso a la costa para la recreación  con barreras de inundación que también servirían como parques  ramblas  y anfiteatros entre otras comodidades En Julio los residentes llegaron a un evento comunitario para opinar de cómo las barreras de inundación deben de ser usadas  El consenso estuvo en contra de la llamada  infraestructura gris   grandes estructuras de cemento  y a favor de la  infraestructura verde   estructuras que incorporan a sistemas naturales  tanto estéticamente como funcionalmente  Falta mucho para que el plan para un sistema de protección costera pase por la fase de diseño  Tal como está ahora  alrededor de dos docenas de estructuras irían a lo largo de la costa  incluyendo bermas  parques elevados y otras barreras temporarias  El sistema podría ser construido en una gran inversión  o una pieza a la vez  dependiendo del peligro más urgente Es un gran proyecto que podría costar muchos millones   la alcaldía no ha publicado un estimar  Pero según Paul Kirshen  profesor de UMass Boston que empezó a estudiar la defensa de East Boston hace una década  costaría medio billón de dólares para proteger todo el barrio  no sólo el tramo de tres millas estudiado por la ciudad  Kirshen dice que el retorno sobre la inversión sería mayor que 10 a 1 Parte De Un Plan Más AmplioEast Boston forma sólo una pieza de un amplio esfuerzo para proteger a la ciudad de las inundaciones  Otros vecindarios que podrían ver sistemas de defensa costera incluyen Charlestown y el Seaport de South Boston  Además  los investigadores en UMass Boston están estudiando la posibilidad de una barrera de millas de largo desde Winthrop hasta Hull  que defendería a todo Boston Harbor Pero las defensas costeras son sólo la primera línea en una defensa más amplia de la ciudad Paso 1  mantener el agua fuera con la infraestructura de mitigación de inundaciones Paso 2  cuando eso llegue a fallar  canalizar la inundación a un área controlada Paso 3  cuando eso llegue a fallar  evacuar a la población Paso 4  regresar a la normalidad lo más pronto posible

938,Mamadou is 45 years old  He fled his native country  Cote d Ivoire  10 years ago  escaping a brutal civil war  We’re not using his full name for his protection He applied for asylum status in the United States  but was denied  Still  U S  authorities deemed it unsafe to return him to his country  so he says he was granted temporary permission to stay here  Back home in Cote d’Ivoire  his father was killed by rebels and his home was burned to the ground Mamadou worked as a taxi driver in New York City for the last decade  But at the end of February  Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents began showing up at his home to arrest him Mamadou says if he were to be deported back to his country  he would be killed How he got to Canada is a dangerous and complex story  After the agents came to deport him  Mamadou fled New York City and made his way to the Canadian border  north of Plattsburgh  New York When he presented himself to Canadian border authorities  they denied him a hearing to seek asylum  citing procedural reasons  That s because the Safe Third Country Agreement prohibits refugees who are already in the U S  from applying for asylum in Canada So the Canadian authorities turned Mamadou back to the U S  Then  around 6 30 that evening  he says   I decide to walk in the forest to Canada  and it was so cold  the snow everywhere  I don t know which direction I was going  I was just walking  I fall in the river two times  Mamadou walked through the snowy woods in freezing temperatures for nine hours  He encountered two rivers he could find no other way around  The first was shallow  but he says the second river was deep and wide  After that crossing he says his body became dangerously cold It was so dark he couldn t even see the tree branches until he felt them whip his face  He says he saw a streetlight in the distance  and he walked for nearly three hours before he reached the street At that point  he says his whole body collapsed  The rest of the story he doesn t remember  until he woke up in a hospital bed Mamadou says a police officer found him lying unconscious in the street  and after realizing he was still alive  the officer brought Mamadou to the hospital  It took six days for him to regain the ability to speak and move his limbs  during which time he was handcuffed in his hospital bed Because Mamadou first approached the border in a legal fashion  presenting himself to Canadian authorities at the checkpoint  Mamadou inadvertently jeopardized his own chances of applying for asylum in Canada If he had simply walked through the woods first  crossing the border illegally between checkpoints  he could have arrived in Canada  and made his first asylum claim then  That s what hundreds of refugees who are fleeing the U S  are doing But because he didn t know about the Safe Third Country Agreement  his claim was denied without ever getting a hearing in front of a judge Stories like Mamadou s have some Canadian lawyers calling for the Safe Third Country Agreement to be revoked Toronto attorney Jared Will recently filed a lawsuit in Canada  arguing that the agreement is illegal under Canadian law Will says there are a number of problems in how the U S  handles refugees that could deem the country unsafe  For one  the U S  bars people from making asylum claims if they ve been in the country over one year If the U S  isn t considered a safe country  then he argues Canada shouldn t be able to deny asylum seekers the right to apply in Canada simply because they already landed in the U S Will s clients are a Syrian woman and her three children  Like Mamadou they also presented themselves at a border checkpoint  not knowing about the agreement The lawsuit is still in its infancy  Will says it could be several months before he hears back from the courts if he has an arguable case Mamadou s lawyer is also considering challenging the Safe Third Country Agreement  and he is in talks with Will about joining his lawsuit against the Canadian government This story comes via the New England News Collaborative  and was first published by Vermont Public Radio  This segment aired on March 22  2017

estadounidenses  Ex funcionarios de ICE dijeron que la orden de arrestar a todos los trabajadores indocumentados vino de los niveles más altos del gobierno De 361 trabajadores  abogados involucrados en la respuesta a la redada estiman que 150 fueron deportados De treinta y tres años de edad  Villeda encontró un escondite debajo de una mesa  Dice que pasaron seis horas antes de que los agentes de

que emigró de Polonia como niño y creció en New Bedford Su asignación fue contestar a las preguntas de diversas agencias  políticos o consulados Orlowski califica la operación como un gran éxito

1021,La administración Trump estima que hay más de 500 niños  de entre 5 y 17 años de edad  que fueron separados de sus padres en la frontera de EE  UU    México  y aún permanecen bajo custodia del gobierno de los EE  UU En muchos de estos casos  los padres ya han sido deportados de vuelta a sus países de origen y se les ha dejado esperando y  en algunos casos  dependiendo de la ayuda de extraños Una mujer de Boston está tratando de ayudar a algunas de esas familias  Aquí  hablamos con dos de las familias de Centroamérica  afectadas por la política de la separación  que ella está tratando de ayudar ‘Nunca pensé que ocurriría esto’La familia Gálvez se sienta a desayunar  vistiendo sus trajes domingueros  mirando hacia el Mar Caribe  Llegar a donde se encuentran  en la ciudad costera de La Ceiba  les tomó cuatro horas en autobús y les costó USD 40  Tuvieron que pedirle el dinero prestado a un amigo  Es  básicamente  el valor de seis meses de ingresos José Héctor Gálvez dice que a duras penas logra alimentar a su familia  y mucho menos reparar las goteras del techo de su casa  De hecho  fue la perspectiva de reparar el techo lo que conllevó a que la familia se separara En mayo  Gálvez y su hija de 16 años  Kenia  se fueron para los EE  UU  El plan era intentar conseguir trabajo durante más o menos un año  ahorrar dinero y regresar a Honduras para reparar su casa  donde habían quedado su esposa y sus otros dos hijos Luego de viajar en autobús a la frontera de EE  UU    México  Gálvez explicó a los funcionarios de inmigración de los EE  UU  que él y su hija querían trabajar  Le dijeron que lo deportarían inmediatamente y que su hija lo seguiría en más o menos una semana  Dice que le dijeron a él y a su hija que se quitaran sus cinturones y los cordones de sus zapatos  Él fue ubicado en una celda de detención con otros hombres mientras que mantuvieron a Kenia con las mujeres y los niños En este punto de la historia contada por su esposo  Rosa Lina Linder  la madre de Kenia  busca un paño para secarse los ojos  Ella dice que se sienten desesperanzados  Ella no ha recibido ayuda de su propio gobierno ni del gobierno de los EE UU Se agarra el corazón y dice  «Lo siento aquí  justo aquí  Me preocupo por ella y le pido a Dios que me la traiga sana y salva  Ella se fue con su padre para poder trabajar  simplemente para poder arreglar nuestra pequeña casa ‘Por favor  envíenme a mi hija’Hace unas semanas  Linder recibió una llamada telefónica de un amigo  El amigo había visto un reportaje de noticias  por televisión  Un número telefónico titiló en la pantalla  con un mensaje que decía  si tiene niños en inmigración de los EE  UU   llame a este número Quien contestó esa llamada fue Isabel López  una abogada inmigrante de Boston  y desde entonces ha contestado docenas de llamadas Sentada en un ruidoso Dunkin Donuts de Boston  López  que es originaria de Honduras  explica que su familia  que aún vive en el país  le dijo que nadie hablaba sobre estos padres que están buscando a sus hijos Desde entonces  dice que ha conversado con casi 70 familias  Ha creado una base de datos con los nombres y números de las personas que están buscando a sus hijos  está poniendo en contacto a estas familias con expertos legales y está comprando tarjetas para llamadas internacionales para que puedan intentar rastrear a sus hijos  Es así como la familia Gálvez terminó en La Ceiba  en donde se reunieron con abogados de inmigración residenciados en Boston ‘No van a quitarme a mi hijo’En Honduras  Carlos Alexis Hernández  de 33 años  ha estado enfrentando estas preguntas  todos los días  durante los últimos tres meses Él dejo su pueblo natal de Olancho para buscar trabajo en los EE  UU  Llevó consigo a su hijo  Carlos Gabriel  de 6 años de edad  Luego de viajar con un traficante de personas a México  él y su hijo compartieron un tubo interno para cruzar el Río Grande  Dice que  finalmente  llegaron caminando a McAllen  Texas  en mayo  y se presentaron ante los funcionarios de inmigración Pero sí me lo quitaron Licona  quien viste unos jeans algo desgastados y una camiseta polo roja  se pone emotivo  hace pausas mientras recuerda a su hijo que corre hacia él y dice llorando  «’Papá quiero quedarme contigo  no dejes que me lleven’  «Licona dice que estuvo allí otros 14 días antes de ser deportado de regreso a Honduras  Dice que el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de los EE  UU  nunca le dijo a dónde llevaban a su hijo ni cuánto tiempo sería retenido  Licona dice que aún no ha sido contactado por el gobierno de los EE  UU Así que cuando Licona vio el número telefónico de Isabel López en la televisión  el mes pasado  llamó de inmediato  López lo asesoró y lo ayudó a desenvolverse en un sistema de inmigración que puede llegar a ser muy complicado  incluso para alguien que habla inglés  Pero para Licona  quien solo habla español y quien no sabe leer  llamar a líneas de atención en los EE  UU  y conseguir ayuda para el papeleo  puede percibirse como algo insuperable Finalmente  Licona se enteró de que su hijo está retenido en unas instalaciones de Nueva York  Habla con él una vez a la semana y dice que su hijo de lo que más habla es de volver a casa  Pregunta cuánto más tiene que esperar y Licona le responde que pronto estará en casa En Boston  López aún contesta llamadas telefónicas de madres y padres que buscan a sus niños y que ponen sus esperanzas en una extraña 
1022,Este reporte tambien está disponible en inglés Fue una discusión a la hora del almuerzo entre los estudiantes de East Boston High School que rápidamente quedó en nada  Pero lo que ocurrió ese día puso en marcha una serie de acciones y  tres años después  todavía hay repercusiones para un joven llamado Orlando Su historia muestra cómo las observaciones de una discusión aparentemente mundana en la escuela secundaria pueden tener un profundo impacto cuando se ponen en manos de funcionarios federales de inmigración  Hay Demasiada Muerte Aquí La pequeña ciudad de Metapán está a aproximadamente dos horas en automóvil de la capital salvadoreña de San Salvador  Está cerca de la frontera con Guatemala Es una tarde calurosa y húmeda cuando nos encontramos con Orlando  de 22 años  Se limpia el sudor de la frente de vez en cuando y dice que es más seguro para nosotros hablar en la plaza en lugar de encontrarnos con él en la casa de sus abuelos  Regresó a El Salvador en enero y dice que la vida aquí es muy dura Hemos acordado usar solo su segundo nombre porque Orlando teme por su seguridad en El Salvador y por la seguridad de sus abuelos  Orlando nació en Metapán  pero nunca se siente como en casa  Dice que su madre lo abandonó cuando era pequeño y que más o menos se ha estado criando él solo durante una gran parte de su vida  Por eso decidió buscar a su padre  Cuando tenía 17 años  comenzó el viaje  solo  dirigiéndose al norte hacia la frontera de EE   UU  y México y  al final  a East Boston Orlando dice que fue secuestrado en México y retenido como rehén durante casi un mes antes de escapar  Poco después  cruzó ilegalmente la frontera cerca de McAllen  Texas Llegó como menor no acompañado en 2014 y fue puesto bajo la custodia de su padre en Boston  Orlando obtuvo una visa juvenil especial para inmigrantes y solicitó la residencia  Dice que se sentía seguro en Boston  trabajando y yendo a la escuela Y entonces  en 2015  un jueves por la tarde en noviembre  todo eso cambió  Es Una Caja Negra La abogada Sarah Sherman Stokes abre el cajón superior de un archivador en su oficina de la Universidad de Boston  Sherman Stokes es directora asociada del programa de Derechos de Inmigrantes y Trata de Personas de la universidad  Representó a Orlando en sus procedimientos de inmigración  Hojea docenas de carpetas  todas relacionadas con el caso de Orlando Dos de esas páginas  un reporte de incidente presentado por un oficial de policía de East Boston High School  activó lo que vino después Comenzó cuando unos cuantos estudiantes se burlaron de otro estudiante en un aula  detalla el informe  La clase termina y pasan a la cafetería para almorzar  momento en el que unos cuantos estudiantes se enfrentan unos a otros  Lo que sigue se describe en el informe como un intento  infructuoso  de iniciar una pelea  Se menciona a un estudiante que le dijo a un funcionario escolar que escuchó decir a unos amigos que algunos de los jóvenes involucrados podrían ser parte de una pandilla Según el informe  los policías escolares revisaron las imágenes de las cámaras de seguridad  Orlando fue identificado como uno de los estudiantes involucrados  En el reporte  aparece como asociado con la pandilla MS 13  La descripción del incidente termina indicando que       este incidente también se enviará al BRIC  El Boston Regional Intelligence Center  BRIC  es una unidad del Departamento de Policía de Boston que recopila y analiza inteligencia  Esa información se comparte con la policía federal Nueve meses después de que el policía escolar presentara el reporte  Orlando se estaba preparando para ir a trabajar a un restaurante mexicano cercano cuando fue arrestado en la casa de su padre por el Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de los Estados Unidos  ICE  Ese reporte de dos páginas sobre el incidente escolar se abrió camino hacia lo que se conoce como un  paquete de pandillas   información compilada por Homeland Security Investigations  o HSI  No está claro cómo ocurrió  pero Orlando supuestamente evolucionó  a los ojos de las autoridades  hasta convertirse en un miembro verificado y activo de la MS 13  Esas eran las clasificaciones impresas en letras mayúsculas en la primera página del paquete de pandillas del gobierno El caso del gobierno también incluía algunas fotos impresas de la cuenta de Facebook de Orlando  Las notas manuscritas en los márgenes y las flechas apuntan a detalles como cordones azules y un sombrero de los Chicago Bulls como prueba  según los fiscales  de la afiliación a MS 13 Orlando  por su parte  insiste en que nunca estuvo involucrado con la pandilla  La abogada de Orlando  Sherman Stokes  dice que este no tiene antecedentes penales Alrededor de este tiempo  East Boston y las comunidades vecinas vieron un aumento en los delitos violentos que se cree estaban asociados con la actividad de las pandillas organizadas  Muchas de las víctimas eran jóvenes de ascendencia centroamericana  En enero de 2016  las autoridades federales  estatales y locales hicieron arrestos en todo el Gran Boston que condujeron a una imputación general de más de 60 presuntos miembros y asociados de MS 13  El mes pasado  uno de los miembros fue condenado a cadena perpetua en relación con los asesinatos de dos adolescentes en East Boston  Las víctimas habían sido apuñaladas docenas de veces El informe del incidente escolar de Orlando fue enviado al BRIC por un sargento de la Policía Escolar de Boston  Según una transcripción de su testimonio en el tribunal de inmigración  el oficial dice que no recibió capacitación especializada en la identificación de actividades de pandillas  pero sus años en el trabajo le enseñaron sobre el comportamiento de las pandillas  Continúa testificando que el seguimiento del comportamiento de las pandillas es una parte importante de sus deberes en East Boston High Los policías escolares son empleados de las Escuelas Públicas de Boston  no del Departamento de Policía de Boston  En un correo electrónico  un portavoz de las Escuelas Públicas de Boston dijo que el Departamento de Policía de Boston brinda capacitación con regularidad a los policías escolares sobre la actividad de las pandillas  Yo Nunca Pondría Esto En Una Base De Datos De Inteligencia Criminal Thomas Nolan es un ex detective de pandillas de la Policía de Boston y profesor de criminología  Actualmente trabaja como analista  evaluando información para abogados de inmigración cuyos clientes tienen los llamados  paquetes de pandillas  creados por el gobierno federal Nolan dice que le preocupa que los oficiales de la Policía Escolar de Boston se estén comportando más como la policía de Boston  pero sin la capacitación adecuada Nolan también trabajó para el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de los EE  UU   la agencia que supervisa los centros de inteligencia regionales como el BRIC  Dice que viajó por todo el país capacitando a las autoridades policiales sobre el tipo de información que debería compartirse en estas bases de datos  WBUR le mostró el informe del incidente de la escuela en el que se denunciaba la asociación de Orlando con la pandilla y describía el incidente de la cafetería El Departamento de Policía de Boston no respondió a las solicitudes de comentarios Algunos policías escolares de Boston han ejercido su autoridad fuera de la propiedad escolar que  según los funcionarios de las Escuelas Públicas de Boston  está fuera de la jurisdicción de la policía escolar  Seis estudiantes enumerados en un  Informe de inteligencia de la policía escolar de Boston  obtenido por WBUR fueron detenidos y registrados en 2017 por agentes de la policía escolar de Boston en un parque para perros en East Boston  El informe fue incluido en uno de los  paquetes de pandillas  del gobierno federal  Fue presentado por el mismo sargento que alegó que Orlando era un miembro de una pandilla Nolan se pregunta si los líderes de la ciudad son plenamente conscientes de la forma en que fluye la información entre la Policía Escolar de Boston y los funcionarios federales de inmigración WBUR envió repetidas solicitudes de información pública a las Escuelas Públicas de Boston  solicitando detalles sobre la capacitación para la policía escolar y otros informes de incidentes que incluyen denuncias de pandillas  A pesar de ganar una apelación de la oficina de registros del estado  WBUR recibió una respuesta de la ciudad denegando la solicitud y declarando que los registros son parte de un litigio activo y en curso  La ACLU de Massachusetts demandó recientemente al Departamento de Policía de Boston por el acceso a su base de datos de pandillas  citando un aumento en las denuncias de pertenencia a pandillas para mantener a las personas detenidas y  en algunos casos  como base para la deportación El Paso De Los Días Después de pasar más de un año detenido por inmigración en Boston  Orlando firmó su propia deportación en 2017  contra el consejo de su abogada  Estaba demasiado deprimido  dice  para esperar el resultado del proceso de apelaciones tras las rejas Sentado en Metapán  Orlando mira hacia la plaza  reflexionando sobre su vida en Boston Orlando todavía se está adaptando a sus alrededores en El Salvador  Está buscando trabajo  pero dice que es casi imposible de encontrar  Pasa la mayoría de los días en la casa  solo para pasar el tiempo

1031,Two separate crimes against children in recent days have one haunting similarity  authorities have pointed to Voodoo rituals as a possible motive But practitioners of Haitian Vodou  which adherents spell differently to distinguish it from other variants  say the religion does not sanction violence and fear the crimes will spark a backlash against their community Two sisters in East Bridgewater were arrested last month after they tied down and burned a 5 year old girl  permanently disfiguring her  in a  voodoo ritual  meant to rid her of a demon  authorities say  Peggy LaBossiere  who was arrested with her sister Rachel Hilaire  also is accused of threatening to cut off the head of the girl s 8 year old brother with a machete About a week later in nearby Brockton  officials said  a mother stabbed two of her children in what she described as a ritual involving  voodoo stuff   according to court documents  Days later  at a candlelight vigil that drew hundreds of mourners to the crime scene  a local Christian bishop denounced the practice of Voodoo  to cheers from the crowd Voodoo refers to religious practices developed by Caribbean slaves who took spiritual traditions from their native Africa and merged them with elements of Christianity and other faiths  Adherents generally believe everything is infused with a spirit and that prayers and other devotional acts will help bring them good health and protection But there has been a movement in recent years in Haiti to refer to the practices as Vodou  which means  spirit  or  deity   to set it apart from U S  Deep South variants more commonly associated with occult objects like Voodoo dolls and talismans The negative portrayal of Voodoo in American culture goes back at least to the Hollywood films of the 1920s and 1930s  said Patrick Bellegarde Smith  a retired professor of African Studies at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee  In  White Zombie   a 1932 film that often is credited as the first feature length zombie flick  Bela Lugosi played an evil Haitian voodoo master who commanded an army of zombies Lunine Pierre Jerome  a Randolph resident who was raised in a Haitian Vodou household and still practices privately  is adamant that what is being described as  voodoo  in these cases is not a reflection of her culture Evans agreed   We don t hurt children  It s about healing  The mother of the woman accused of killing her sons had voiced concerns to police about her daughter s mental health and said her daughter had become obsessed recently with a range of conspiracy theories  rituals and mythologies  The Brockton Enterprise reported   It is not clear whether the woman is a follower of Haitian Vodou  and her attorney did not respond to an email sent on Friday The women accused of burning the child blew fire in her face and cut her on the arm and in the collar area with a needle like object  police said  LaBossiere and Hilaire  who are of Haitian descent  said they had performed  cleansing baths  on the children but denied threatening or harming them  The Enterprise reported  Police said the girl s mother requested the ritual The women have pleaded not guilty to mayhem  assault and other charges and are being held without bail  An attorney for LaBossiere declined to comment  and an attorney for Hilaire did not respond to a phone message on Friday A spokeswoman for the Plymouth County District Attorney s office  which is handling both cases  declined to comment Animal sacrifices are also common in Vodou  but  only the devil may destroy people s life   Pierre Jerome said Elizabeth McAlister  a religion professor at Wesleyan University in Middletown  Connecticut  who specializes in Haitian Vodou and other Afro Caribbean faiths  also questioned the link between Vodou and the two cases

1035,This report is also available in English Cándido Reyes y Luz María Muñiz encontraron el amor tarde en la vida  ella a sus 50 y tantos y el a sus 60 y tantos  pero al menos encontraron lo que algunas personas nunca encuentran  Él le dijo que la amaba más que a Dios y él lo creía hasta el punto en que se disculpaba por ello en sus oraciones Cuando golpeó el huracán María  este jueves hace un año  Pérez dijo que estaba desesperada por saber cómo estaba su madre  pero no había servicio de celulares Pasó una semana antes de que Pérez recibiera noticias de que todos estaban bien  pero pasaron meses antes de que se restaurara la electricidad en Toa Baja  Cándido Reyes y Luz María Muñiz sobrevivieron a la tormenta  pero lo peor aún estaba por llegar Personas de toda la isla  de 135 millas de largo  dicen que la estela del huracán María es lo más difícil con lo que han tenido que lidiar  significó una vida sin electricidad durante meses ininterrumpidos  Para las ancianos y enfermizos  personas cuya atención médica depende de electricidad estable  el huracán era una sentencia de muerte Para Cándido Reyes  el hombre que amaba más a su esposa de lo que amaba a Dios  los meses posteriores a la tormenta fueron demasiado para su corazón Tres meses después de la tormenta  Cándido Reyes murió de insuficiencia cardíaca Contando los fallecidosEl recuento de fallecidos por una catástrofe natural  normalmente  no está sujeto a controversia  pero Puerto Rico es único Durante meses luego del huracán  el gobierno puertorriqueño insistió en que solo murieron 64 personas en la tormenta  El presidente Trump  cuando visitó por primera vez la isla  dijo que María no era una “verdadera catástrofe como Katrina ”Pero las personas sobre el terreno pensaban distinto  El Centro Puertorriqueño para el Periodismo Investigativo fue el líder  Los periodistas  en colaboración con Quartz y Associated Press  entrevistaron a las familias de 300 personas que murieron en la estela de María y revisaron los testimonios de 200 más Los periodistas determinaron que para el 1o de octubre  casi dos semanas después de que atacó la tormenta  habían muerto 152 personas por falta de electricidad No fue sino hasta agosto de 2018 cuando el gobierno puertorriqueño cambió el número de víctimas oficial estimado de 62 a 2975 Lidiando con las secuelasAlgunos puertorriqueños lidian con la muerte por medio del arte  Uno de ellos es Pedro Adorno  que ha sido presidente  durante 25 años  de Agua  Sol y Sereno  una colectivo teatral comunitario de San Juan  La compañía viajó por todo Puerto Rico en las semanas y meses posteriores a la tormenta  llevando sus títeres a las personas  y Adorno dice que pronto fue evidente que no se estaba comunicando la verdadera dimensión de la devastación Esta semana  como WBUR está de nuevo en Puerto Rico  condujimos hasta Sabana Seca para buscar a Luz María Muñiz  La noche anterior nos había dicho que estaría contenta de recibirnos  aunque no estaba contestando el teléfono en la mañana Las primeras personas que vimos en el pueblo se ofrecieron a ayudar a encontrar la casa  Nos contaron sobre su propia devastación y dijeron que la mayoría de las personas se habían ido del pueblo  bien a tierra firme o a otras partes de Puerto Rico Podíamos sentir su ausencia en el aire  a pesar del zumbido de las herramientas eléctricas y al canto entrecortado de los gallos de pelea  Sabana Seca se sentía de alguna forma más tranquila de como debería estar La residente Marta María Hernández dijo que la vida no es igual con tantas personas que se han ido  Ella dijo que las personas solían pasear a sus perros y saludar a los demás  Ahora todo es silencioso y nadie sale de su casa Finalmente encontramos la casa  Golpeamos el portón de acero   ¡Maríiiia    Gritó el hijo de Hernández  pero no hubo respuesta En el sofocante calor la vecina de al lado  Juana Alicea  nos ofreció jugo de naranja frío en su patio  Ella recordó los gritos en la casa de al lado de que Cándido Reyes había muerto  Ella dijo que se apresuró en dirección a los gritos y cuando vio a Cándido Reyes  estaba tendido en el suelo  respirando por última vez Ella pasó su mano sobre los párpados de él y le dijo a Luz María que no se preocupara  su esposo ya no estaba sufriendo Le envié un mensaje de texto a la hija de Muñiz  Pérez  a su casa  y finalmente supo sobre su madre Nos fuimos de Toa Baja y esperábamos que Muñiz hablara con nosotros cuando se sintiera mejor  pero no volvió a contestar más el teléfono La muerte es algo que muchos puertorriqueños se han visto forzados a confrontar en la oscura estela de María  bien del lado de sus seres queridos  o más recientemente  en la aseveración de que el recuento de muertes es una ficción diseñada para difamar al presidente Pérez describe los eventos como su llamado a convertirse en activista  Inició un podcast sobre puertorriqueños en la diáspora  y luego de haber nacido y crecido en tierra firme  por primera vez consideró mudarse a la isla Cuando murió su padrastro  Pérez decidió mudarse definitivamente a Puerto Rico   Para mí es una travesía espiritual  porque  puedo regresar y conectarme con mi cultura y mi gente  y puedo encontrar maneras de ayudar sobre el terreno  Puerto Rico perdió a miles en la estela de la tormenta  pero al menos la isla ganará una con la llegada de personas como
