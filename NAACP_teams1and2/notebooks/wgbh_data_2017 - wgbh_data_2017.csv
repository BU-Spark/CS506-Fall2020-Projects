""And that’s probably caught these sharks off guard, and they’re trying to move rapidly south. What they’re doing is bumping into Cape Cod and getting trapped in Cape Cod Bay, and that’s causing these issues.”, The three sharks died from being stranded. Skomal emphasized the strandings appear to be a natural event, and there's no indication of what he called ""foul play."" He said it's common for one thresher shark to strand on the Cape in a season, but three in one week is unusual., , ""We want the folks out there who are walking the beaches — who dare walk the beaches in this weather — if they see these things, please report them to the Division of Marine Fisheries or the New England Aquarium,"" he added., The Atlantic Shark Conservancy and state and federal officials collected organ and tissues samples to help research the sharks and their deaths. The conservancy is raising money for equipment to help them respond to shark strandings., The geography of Cape Cod also traps hundreds of sea turtles each winter. So far, more than 260 have been rescued and brought to the New England Aquarium’s sea turtle hospital. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

Why You Should Care More About 17th Century Bathrooms Than You Do (18.6% of the vote), Back in October, an archaeological dig in the North End uncovered a 17th century outhouse near where Paul Revere lived. While it may be interesting enough that this is where Revere may have relieved himself, old bathrooms such as this one are treasures for archaeologists, giving them valuable insight into the past. , , 3. Thinking And Driving? The Brain Is Built For That (11.9% of the vote), One Curiosity Desk listener reached out describing a situation that many of us are familiar with: realizing there are long stretches when their mind wanders while driving, but simultaneously managing to stay on the road and make all the right turns.

6,"[In Quincy, An Animal Hospital Rescues A Growing Number Of Sea Turtles Stranded On Cape Cod]","[Ten minutes before the patients arrive, walkie-talkies start buzzing. Clusters of technicians and interns, dressed in scrubs, snap to attention. Carts loaded with medical equipment are wheeled into place., Suddenly, the patients are here — and they’re in rough shape. Some, when prodded with thermometers, twitch an arm listlessly. Others are so comatose they look completely dead., But these patients aren’t being unloaded from ambulances and wheeled in on gurneys. They’re packed in cardboard banana boxes lined with towels. And they’re not even human, though you’d be forgiven for thinking so, given the careful medical attention they’re receiving., They’re sea turtles., Biologist Adam Kennedy is working the floor today at the New England Aquarium’s Animal Care Center, a state-of-the-art marine animal rehab facility nestled in Quincy’s old shipyard. Two turtles have just come in, rescued off the beaches of Cape Cod by volunteers, and he’s giving them a preliminary check-up. One turtle is completely motionless, and Kennedy directs it to an ultrasound machine to check for a heartbeat. The other flaps its fins sluggishly when poked — a promising sign. He writes an identification number carefully on its shell., Kennedy wasn’t always in this line of work. Originally a programmer in the pharmacy business, he started volunteering with the aquarium back in 2002, hoping to work with seals and whales. But it was the turtles and their unusual plight that won him over., “Like a lot of folks, I didn’t really know there were sea turtles in Cape Cod Bay,” he said. “Who would think a reptile would be in Cape Cod Bay?”, , Turtles come to Cape Cod for the same reason we do, explains Tony LaCasse, the New England Aquarium's media relations director: “The restaurants are good, the seafood is good.” They travel up north from the Gulf of Mexico in the summer to feast on the crab off the Cape Cod coast, when the water is in the balmy 60s or 70s. But when the temperature starts to drop, the trouble starts., Come September, as the water begins to cool, the turtles feel the urge to migrate back down south. But blocking the way to the south and east is the arm of Cape Cod’s peninsula. Many of these turtles are babies and inexperienced, unable to intuit that they must swim north, past Provincetown, before they can get back out into the Atlantic. Many become trapped in the bay., Turtles are reptiles and cold-blooded, which means that their inner temperature fluctuates with the temperature of their surroundings. As the water chills to a frigid 50 degrees or less, these turtles, over time, become seriously hypothermic, or ""cold stunned."" Their metabolisms slow, and so do their heartbeats (some even as slow as one or two beats per minute.) They become so sluggish that they’re no longer able to catch food and feed themselves. Then they wash up on the north Cape’s beaches — in recent years, hundreds and hundreds of them — some covered in algae and even barnacles like you’d see on rocks and shipwrecks., “The average sea turtle somebody would find on the Cape, particularly by Thanksgiving on,  if you discovered it, you’d probably think it was dead,” La Casse says., The New England Aquarium believes Cape Cod is the only place where these annual mass turtle strandings occur in the entire country, maybe even the world. And a unique problem requires a unique solution, which is where the turtle hospital comes in., , The Care Center is filled with tanks, some outfitted with glass along the sides so you can see turtles zipping through the water. In one is a handful of three-or-four-pound Kemp’s ridley sea turtles, the rarest and most endangered sea turtle species. Most turtles that wash up on the Cape are Kemp’s ridleys., In another tank is a hulking loggerhead turtle — named so for its large, thick head and neck — lumbering solo. These can grow to be hundreds of pounds, which can make for a challenge when they need medical attention or there are more than one of them. (Loggerheads get aggressive with other loggerheads, so staffers sometimes have to separate the snippy ones with a few strategic swipes of a netting pole.), Today, interns Kathy McCarthy and Sarah DiCarlo had to hoist an 80-pound loggerhead over to the X-ray labs. “How do you lift something like this?” they’re asked.  “With your legs, not your back,” DiCarlo quips., Since the turtles become hypothermic over the course of weeks, the Care Center takes a similar approach to warming them back up again: they do it over time. A series of tanks are heated to different, gradually warming temperatures (for example, 55 degrees, then 60 degrees, then 65 degrees, and so on) and turtles move from one to the next when they’re ready. Warming them too quickly creates a fertile atmosphere for the pathogens that have loaded on board while they’re stranded, and these turtles — whose immune systems have been compromised by their hypothermia — wouldn’t be able to fight them off., In the meantime, they’re monitored closely. They get X-rays to check their lungs for pneumonia, are administered antibiotics and antifungals, get regular exercise, and are encouraged to build an appetite back up. The goal is not only to rewarm them, but to nurse them back to full health., “It’s both rehab and convalescence,” La Casse says., , This hospital was built to comfortably house around 100 patients, which in the past, when their average intake was around 70-90, was more than enough. But that’s changed., In the last five years, their average has ballooned to over 300. One year, they had 700. When the numbers get that high, the Care Center must find other places for the turtles to complete their rehab, sending them to aquariums all over the east coast., The influx points to both the Care Center’s successes and signs of a changing climate around Cape Cod. More turtles means their populations are growing and stabilizing. On the other hand, it points to the fact that the seas around the Cape are warming up — according to some estimates, the Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest-warming bodies of water in the world — which means that turtles will venture further and further north to feed on crab.  , “In 30 or 50 years, our ecosystem could look much more like what you’d find off the Maryland-Virginia coast,” La Casse says. “That also means that the cold temperate species are not going to be able to survive here as well, or maybe not at all.”, New England staples, like lobster, could become rare or even disappear from the region., When animals move into areas that don’t have rules in place to protect them, tragedy can strike. That’s what happened when North Atlantic right whales began moving outside of protected areas to search for food: many were entangled in fishing traps and killed, which decimated their already-fragile population. , For Kennedy, protecting these vulnerable species from human damage is one of the concerns that drives his work., “A lot of what has been done to the sea turtles has been done by humans,” Kennedy says. He hopes that there will still be Kemp’s ridleys and loggerheads when his three young sons are his age., “We’ve done so much to this planet,” he continues. “Every little thing we can do to help, I think we should. “, Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

8,"[2017: The Year Of Trump, Tax Cuts, Twitter Battles, America Divided and #MeToo]","[
	From inauguration drama and ensuing protests to the eleventh-hour tax bill just passed by Congress — with Twitter battles, legal drama, and the “Me Too” movement in between — it has been quite the eventful year. Boston Globe Business Columnist Shirley Leung
	and Shannon O’Brien, former state treasurer, joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston to reflect on the stories that defined 2017.
	 
	“I think the Republicans in Congress have figured out what they need to do to work with Donald Trump,” said Jennifer Braceras, conservative columnist and former editor of NewBostonPost.com, when she joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston. “Sadly, flattery is a big piece of it.”
	 
	“Love him or hate him, [Trump] has really shaken up Washington and shaken up politics just as he promised,” said Shirley Leung, a business columnist at The Boston Globe and WGBH News contributor. “The tax bill at the end of the year is pretty big. That will have a lasting impact.”
	 
	In addition to presiding over the passing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which also includes a repeal of the individual mandate that helped define Obamacare — the president also scored major wins by confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, as well as 12 other judges to federal appeals courts, and he has made a slew of regulatory changes through executive orders.
	 
	“I think you’re going to see it has been a major change,” said Shannon O’Brien, former Democratic state treasurer, referring to the tax bill. “I think he’s done a lot. I think he’s harmed a lot.”
	 
	Braceras disagreed, saying that despite what, at times, has been a chaotic White House, the Trump administration’s accomplishments have been “standard Republican red meat.”, 
	“They are all things that almost all of Republican candidates for president campaigned on,” said Braceras. “The critique on the merits [of Trump’s policies] is no different than the critique on George Bush or Ronald Reagan, or any other Republican president.”
	 
	Outside of Washington, D.C. there has been plenty of controversy surrounding the President’s relationship with the rest of the American public over the past year – including fallout from the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville and Trump’s anger toward a group of mostly black N.F.L. players kneeling during the national anthem.
	 
	Leung said all of the controversy is simply Trump playing to those who put him in office., 
	“He’s really speaking to his base,” said Leung. “A lot of these issues came up last year on the campaign. While it can be shocking, he’s speaking to the people that elected him.”
	 
	“Everybody is doubling down on their divisiveness,” said Braceras. “The Democrats are doubling down on deplorable, the Republicans are doubling down on anti-political correctness and, as a result, we're not able to find common ground or really talk to each other. That, to me, is the greatest harm that Donald Trump has done.”
	 
	While there’s little bipartisanship in Washington, one movement has managed to create common ground across political lines: the women of the nation who have stepped up and spoken out against sexual misconduct in the #MeToo., 
	Recently, Cambridge-born actor Matt Damon stirred up controversy when he argued that society needs to differentiate between varying degrees of harassment and assault. 
	 
	“Matt needed to say that,” said Leung. “A lot of people are thinking that but are afraid to say it — that a pat on the butt is not the same as sexual assault. And we have to find a way to talk about the issue without saying all men are sexual harassers.”
	 
	“There is something that is unprecedented in this county,” added O’Brien. “I believe there needs to be a differentiation and there needs to be process. But most important is, it’s out in the air right now.”, Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"

12,[Massachusetts man released on bail 32 years after 1986 murder conviction vacated],"[BROCKTON — Darrell Jones walked out of a courthouse Thursday afternoon after his release on bail more than 30 years after being convicted for a murder he always maintained he didn’t commit. , The 50-year-old man left Brockton Superior Court, where he was found guilty in 1986 by an all-white jury and sentenced to to life without the possibility of parole. , Surrounded by friends and family, he thanked lawyers, family members, and reporters who investigated his case. He said he plans to fight for justice for others and prison rights. , “I stayed in prison a long time. It was hard to get people to hear you,’’ he said. “There is somebody else back in that jail that nobody is listening to that is probably innocent. , Jones was out of prison on $5,000 bail after Superior Court Judge Robert Cosgrove made the decision to release him on the original bail required when the then-18-year-old was first charged in the 1985 murder of alleged Cuban drug dealer Guillermo Rodriguez. , The hearing came days after a different Superior Court judge, Thomas F. McGuire Jr, vacated his conviction, ruling that the case was tainted by racial bias and misconduct. Jones is planning to move in with a Jesuit priest – whom he calls “Dad” -- who has been serving as a friend and mentor for more than a decade. , “This is absolutely spectacular,’’ said Rev. William Barry who has secured a place, free of charge, in his religious retreat in a Boston suburb for Jones to live in for a year. , The Plymouth County District Attorney’s office opposed Jones’s release claiming it still had a strong case to either appeal McGuire’s decision or re-prosecute the case. , But Jones’s attorney, Lisa Kavanaugh, argued that her client is not a flight risk because he wants to stick around to prove his innocence -- and he has a “strong likelihood of winning.” , She also argued that Jones has “an extraordinary amount of support” including Barry, a pro-bono therapist he has been talking to for years, as well as family. , Jones filed a motion to re-open his case in 2015 based on allegations that police tampered with a videotaped interview of a key witness shown at his trial to remove exculpatory evidence. He claimed the tape was key to his conviction because none of the eyewitnesses testified in court that they were sure Jones was the shooter. , Allegations of racial bias in the court were raised in a 2016 
investigation by the the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and WBUR public radio. Juror Eleanor Urbati, a white Hingham resident who said she always regretted convicting Jones, told NECIR that two jurors had told her they thought the defendant was guilty because he was black. , McGuire, who now presides in Bristol County Superior Court, ruled on Jones’s motion because he was seated in Plymouth when the motion was first filed. He wrote that he first learned of allegations of racial bias when someone flagged the 2016 investigation and then requested Urbati and other jurors to detail what had occurred. The hearing came months after a US Supreme Court ruling that a trial judge must pry into typically secret discussions if there is evidence of racial bias. , Urbati, reached at home Thursday, said she was thrilled to hear about Jones’s release. “I’m very happy for him,’’ she said. “I told the truth.” , Jones’s sister, Classie Howard, 53, who flew in from Texas for the last-minute hearing, said she could hardly believe her brother was finally walking out of the same courthouse he was convicted in. She said she was thrilled about his release but angry about the pain her family suffered. “It started here and it ended here,’’ she said. , Jones spoke for a few minutes but was eager to get in a waiting car and leave Brockton., “Keep the car warmed,” he said. “I want to get out of here.” , This story was co-published with the Boston Globe.

16,"[15 Years After Sex Abuse Scandal, Has The Catholic Church's Track Record Improved?]","[It's been 15 years since the legacy of former Boston archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law, who died Wednesday morning at the age of 86, was tainted by the Catholic Church abuse scandal. In that time, understanding of sexual misconduct and procedures for reporting sexual abuse have evolved — both within religious spheres and beyond. Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, former state attorney general and district attorney Martha Coakley, and Boston Public Radio co-host Margery Eagan joined Greater Boston Wednesday to discuss whether this understanding has evolved enough to prevent incidents like those detailed in 2002 scandal. , Law went from being a beloved, devoted member of the Catholic Church to an emblem of the scandal after it was revealed that he and other clergymen in the city's archdiocese covered up decades of accusations of child sexual abuse. In December 2002, Law resigned as the archbishop of Boston. He moved to Rome, where he was appointed the archpriest at Basilica of St. Mary Major by Pope John Paul II in 2004. He left that position in 2011., Garabedian, who has represented hundreds of victims of clergy sexual abuse, was on the fence about whether the laws or societal views surrounding church abuse have improved since the scandal. , “In Massachusetts, they're getting better. Across the country, they're not. You often hear opponents of victims speak out saying, 'That person should not be speaking out. They should try this case in court.' But they can't try the case in court because the statute of limitations has run,"" Garabedian said. ""The church isn't going to change. They've been doing this for centuries. They've been raping kids at a wholesale pace for centuries. You can't keep track of the church, it's a trillion-dollar business. What is changing is society's attitude of 'I better watch my child when that child is around a priest,' or in Hollywood or in anywhere else. That's what's changing.”, , Coakley, who successfully prosecuted former priests John Geoghan and Paul Shanley for abuse-related crimes, believes reporting laws are stronger now., ""The church has to report,” she said. “I think DAs offices have specialized child abuse units that have gotten better at this, and I think the power of the church has also changed — that they no longer have the ability to enable, to hide, to move priests around. That's the biggest change, and that's the important thing. We see this now in other cases where predators are supported in their movie careers and politics. That is all crumbling, but some of this started with this — not letting authority get away with enabling predators.”, “I think what's changed is attitudes,” added Eagan. “We’ve seen the priests. Now we're seeing this 'Me Too' moment, and I think there's a change in attitudes. I think we believe victims a lot more than we used to.”, Garabedian, though, was still not convinced., “Right now, in my office, I have over 500 Catholic clergy sex abuse cases,” he said. “I'm fighting tooth and nail with law firms. I'm fighting tooth and nail with churches. I'm fighting with religious orders or diocese or archdiocese saying, 'You're not going to touch us. Don't bother us' … The public has been more aware of the need to protect children. That's the success. The church has circled the wagon tighter than ever.”, He also criticized the Catholic Church's decision to give Law a full cardinal's funeral, complete with a final blessing from the Pope., “It’s a slap in the face. It's insulting,"" he said.

But for many today — Catholics, non-Catholics, and perhaps most of all, former Catholics — he’s remembered primarily as an enabler of child sexual abuse, who oversaw the relocation of pedophile priests from parish to parish., “Cardinal Law was the scapegoat of the hierarchy,"" said James Carroll, a former priest and author of many books, including his upcoming novel “The Cloister.” ""But he was also its hero, because, after all, he had only done what all bishops were doing and what the Vatican itself had instructed bishops to do.”, And that understanding — that in Boston, not only were children victimized by priests, but that the church hierarchy, with Cardinal Law at the helm, allowed it to happen — continues to test the faith of many Catholics: not necessarily their faith in the religion, but in the institution of the church. Carroll says many decided just to leave., “And then of course those of us who remain Catholics — I'm a churchgoing Catholic myself — still carry this deep, deep wound, not only of the scandal of the decades-long abuse of children by priests, but at the church's ongoing failure to recognize to reckon with what was laid bare in that scandal,” Carroll said., Some who remained in the church banded together to found Voice of the Faithful, an organization devoted to supporting the victims of abuse and to help direct change within the church that prevents this sort of thing in the future. Donna Doucette, the group’s executive director, said at first, their plan was to help Cardinal Law in addressing the harm that was done., “It quickly became obvious that Cardinal Law wasn't interested in help from anybody, especially from laypeople,” Doucette said. She said Voice of the Faithful continues to try to help victims of abuse to heal, in a way she says the church still hasn’t. “The effort in the church appears to begin from the premise that we have to bring everybody back to the church if they left and then they'll all be healed. No. Some people are not going to come back to the church. But that does not eliminate your need to offer whatever pathways towards healing that you can.”   , Although many did leave the church, some Catholics, like Tiziana Dearing, decided to become more engaged. Dearing, who’s now a professor at Boston College, became the president of Catholic Charities, an independent nonprofit within the Archdiocese of Boston. And she says they didn’t actually see donations go down as many left the church., “I would argue that there were probably some donors, and I heard from some of these donors when I was running Catholic Charities, who in fact took the money that they might have given to their parish in the past, and, in fact, put it into Catholic social justice work like a Catholic Charities or a Catholic Relief Services instead,” Dearing said., Dearing said nothing that happened in the clergy sex abuse scandal changes the fact that the faithful are called to help the victimized, the poor and the marginalized., One parish that’s trying to do that ultimately wound up founding an entirely new church. St. Frances Xavier Cabrini Church was among dozens the archdiocese said in the 2004 that they were closing to address their debt. The archdiocese doesn't acknowledge that the sale is related to the scandal, but settlements in those cases led to financial problems. Jon Rogers, a spokesperson for the group of parishioners, says several of the abusive priests were part of the church at some point, and there were victims among church members., “It really is upsetting to look back and say, 'OK, you know, this community was damaged by these people. And now on top of that they destroyed our church because they had to pay off the coffers that were depleted by the sexual abuse crisis,'” Rogers said., The parishioners of St. Frances refused to leave, staging a 24-hour vigil in the church that wound up lasting 11 years, before they exhausted their legal challenges and were evicted., Now, they meet weekly at a rented Freemasons hall. Rogers says while he’s still a Catholic, he’s no longer a Roman Catholic. He blames that, in large part, on Cardinal Bernard Law., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
18,"[Survivor, Local Journalists Speak On Cardinal Law's Death]","[“I decided to wear my mourning suit today,” said Phil Saviano, an abuse survivor and founder of the New England chapter of Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests (SNAP) when he joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston to discuss the death of Cardinal Bernard Law., “Not in recognition of the departure of Cardinal Law, but out of respect for the thousands of clergy abuse survivors who are so traumatized by their childhood experiences that they grew up to die of drug overdoses and alcoholism and suicide. Those people and their families are where my thoughts are today,"" he said. , Law, who became an emblem of the Catholic clergy abuse scandal in Boston, died Wednesday morning at age 86. He was propelled to notoriety when it was revealed that he and other clergymen in the archdiocese of Boston covered up decades of accusations of child sexual abuse. In December 2002, Law resigned as the archbishop of Boston and, in 2004, moved to Rome where he was appointed the archpriest at Basilica of St. Mary Major by Pope John Paul II. He resigned from that position in 2011., “It's easy to forget, 15 years later, that at that time, the Catholic Church was the most powerful institution in the city of Boston,” said Michael Rezendes, who was on The Boston Globe Spotlight team that helped expose the abuse to the world. “Boston was the most Catholic city in America and it was a city of devout tribal Catholics. Law was a very powerful man in Boston, across the United States and at the Vatican.”, “It just struck me that he went on to a life of luxury and prominence in the Vatican,” said Boston Public Radio co-host Margery Eagan, recalling a recent tour she went on of Rome and the Vatican, during which her bus went by the Basilica of St. Mary. “It just was realizing how the salt was rubbed into the wounds.”, “In addition to living a pretty nice life, Cardinal Law also maintained a lot of influence and a lot of power at the Vatican,” Rezendes pointed out. “I think Cardinal Law saw his job as protecting the church from scandal. Cardinal Law saw his job as protecting the institution and he forgot about the people the institution was supposed to serve.”, “I always like to think if there had been a few women in those rectors we wouldn't have the problems that we’ve ended up with,” said Saviano., As for the announcement that Law will receive a full cardinal’s funeral, complete with a final blessing from the Pope — all three were displeased., “I think it's disgusting and I think it's a slap in the face to survivors,” said Saviano. “And I wonder just what is the message that he's sending with this sumptuous going away party.”, Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"
19,[Town Criers Preserve A Christmas Tradition On Nantucket],"[During the recent Christmas Stroll on Nantucket, throngs of people milled around the intersection of Main and Federal Streets awaiting the arrival of Town Crier Eric Goddard to officially kick off the festivities., Goddard is the latest in a long line of town criers on the island. And he looks every bit the part, with a top hat, bell, and a scarf that was knitted by his mother for this occasion., “This scarf’s probably 10 feet long. And I wear this once a year on Christmas Stroll Saturday,” Goddard said., Goddard became the town crier after assuming the position from his friend and long-time island resident Curtis Barnes, who filled the role for 28 years., These days, the town crier’s role is purely ceremonial. But during the 18th and 19th centuries, town criers played a vital role on Nantucket., “There were no newspapers,” said Barnes. “The town crier would walk around and ring the bell and pass the news whenever something was happening.”, Barnes points out that when Price Harry recently decided to get married, the town crier of London announced it to the population., “There’s a very long tradition going back into Medieval history of the town crier being the person who brought the news and told people when they had to pay their taxes, and they were the walking, living, breathing newspapers of the day.” , Town criers on Nantucket also had an important function during Nantucket’s whaling days., “When the whaling ships would come back after three years in the Pacific Ocean, the town crier would go around and broadcast, ‘Hear ye! The ship is coming in!’ And that would warn everyone and get them ready for their husbands and friends to return,” Barnes explained., Some criers also used long horns, called “trumpets,” to make their voices louder., “The trumpet was to broadcast out. You didn’t have microphones and speakers and stuff, so it was to spread the word. Now some of us don’t need that. I’m pretty loud, and I can be heard,” Barnes said. , By the early 1900s, the town crier’s role had become obsolete, but it was re-instituted in the 1970s with the start of Christmas Stroll., During this year’s stroll, current town crier Eric Goddard led a crowd of children and parents down the cobblestones of Main Street to greet Santa at Straight Wharf., Santa hopped up onto an old fire truck for the festive trip back into town, with Eric Goddard calling out holiday greetings to young and old as he led the crowd., With his bell, top hat and 10-foot long red scarf, he was clearly in his element — performing a function that’s no longer a necessity in people’s lives, but which added a welcome touch of tradition to a Nantucket Christmas.  , ]"
20,"[Cardinal Law's Life, Legacy And Fall From Grace]","[Cardinal Bernard Law will be remembered for his inaction when in fact he was a powerful voice for action on issues ranging from AIDS to education and racial inequality. While his manner was often imperious, he had an accessible approach. He wrote and spoke eloquently, and he made himself available to both the people and the press in ways no previous cardinal had ever done., When he first arrived in Boston in January of 1984, the Boston media was already well acquainted with the archbishop-to-be. Thousands of words had already been written, and as Law said on that introductory day, “I find difficulty recognizing myself in some of the things I read and hear. I hope it is not a false expectation, so a subsequent disappointment won’t set in.´´ Little did we know., Now forever tarnished by his role in allowing pedophile priests to transfer from parish to parish with no criminal liability, Law’s legacy is one dimensional. Lost is his deep appreciation for the struggles of others, his uncompromising devotion to causes and battles of social concern, and the memories of how he reached out to leaders of all faiths, government, and business to pull them together for combined efforts of good will. It was Cardinal Law who ensured that the name of our now iconic cable-stayed bridge would honor Lenny Zakim, the onetime head of Boston’s Anti-Defamation League., His arrogant, charismatic and sometimes self-deprecating manner served him well. He was a power player, though deeply flawed., Law’s own words on the day of his historic installation at the Church of the Holy Cross in Boston now leave us with a haunting memory of what could have been – and never will be. He said, “However future historians may judge what begins to be unfolded this day, the graced event of which we are a part, will be remembered long after each of us has died.”, This post has been updated., Emily Rooney is the host of Beat the Press and a WGBH News special correspondent.]"
21,[Jill Stein Campaign Under Investigation For Possible Russia Ties],"[The Russia probe coming out of the Senate Intelligence Committee now involves another presidential candidate from 2016: Green Party nominee Jill Stein., National security expert Juliette Kayyem joined Boston Public Radio to explain how Stein might be linked to Russia., “The Senate has asked for information about her campaign ... and Russia involvement,” Kayyem said. “She, to be fair to her, says they're not going to find anything.”, The committee is leading one of at least three federal investigations into Russian ties to the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to manipulate the 2016 election. It is now interested in the ties between the Stein campaign and Russia., Jill Stein attended a 2015 party in celebration of Russia’s government news service, and she was photographed at a table with President Vladimir Putin and former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who has entered a plea deal with the special counsel investigating campaign ties to Russia., “Her opinions are definitely pro-Russia, much more so even the Trump campaign,” Kayyem said. “That’s the question that [Sen. Richard Burr (R-North Carolina)] is raising — were there any contacts [or] a conspiracy of the opponents, and one of them was working with the Russians?”, Kayyem says if Jill Stein colluded with Russian officials, it was not in an effort to cement her own victory; instead, it would have been designed to weaken Hillary Clinton’s campaign., “Sometimes you wonder, was the goal to even have Donald Trump win?” she said. “It was just to disrupt or undermine Hillary Clinton before she became president.”, National security expert Juliette Kayyem joins Boston Public Radio every week.

22,[Boston Public School Parents Unhappy About New Start Times ],"[The parents of Boston public elementary and middle schools students continue to criticize the school committee's decisions to make start times later for the next school year., In an attempt to save money on busing and to accommodate the 8 a.m. or later high school start times, K-8 schools would have to start and be released earlier. This would create childcare problems for working parents who would now either have to pick their children up earlier or be forced to spend more money on after-school care., Former Secretary of Education Paul Reville emphasized the school system’s second role as a daycare center on Boston Public Radio Wednesday. “Beyond any function it performs as an education center, it is a daycare center,” said Reville. “When you change the terms of the daycare agreement, people get upset.”, Reville believes that the thought process behind the later start times is well-intentioned, but changing any aspect of the school system — even something seemingly trivial like start times — can be quite difficult., “Naturally, it disrupts people's lives, so there's a political response to it,” said Reville., Parents unhappy with the change still have a chance to have their grievances heard as the school committee will be assessing their decision in January, when they will reach a final verdict on the start times for next school year.   , Click the audio player above to hear more from Paul Reville., Jason Turesky is an Associate Producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

24,"[Bernard Law, Former Archbishop Of Boston, Dies In Rome]","[Updated at 8:30 a.m. ET, Cardinal Bernard Law, the former archbishop of Boston — once widely seen as America's most influential prelate before resigning in disgrace amid the growing clergy sexual abuse scandal — has died in Rome., The Holy See's press office confirmed Law's death ""after a long illness."" He was 86., In a carefully worded statement, reflecting the ongoing anger at the longtime prelate for his role helping to cover up the sins of pedophile priests, his successor, Cardinal Sean P. O'Malley said, ""I recognize that Cardinal Law's passing brings forth a wide range of emotions ...particularly ... all who experienced the trauma of sexual abuse by clergy."" He offered ""sincere apologies [and] continued prayers and ... support."", O'Malley went on to say, ""It is a sad reality that for many, Cardinal Law's life and ministry is identified with one overwhelming reality, the crisis of sexual abuse by priests ... because his pastoral legacy has many other dimensions,"" from civil rights and ecumenical work, to his care for the poor and immigrants., The Vatican on Wednesday also released a statement expressing condolences, praying ""for the repose of his soul,"" but making no mention of the clergy's sexual abuse scandal., Law was at ground zero of the crisis when it exploded in Boston in 2002. He remained the face of the scandal, as it swelled to the tsunami that engulfed the Catholic Church worldwide., Law's response to the growing crisis only fueled the rage. For example, shortly after the scandal broke, he showed little compunction, issuing a carefully worded, Nixonian concession., ""Judgments were made ... which in retrospect were tragically incorrect,"" he said. Even as allegations and protests continued to mount, parishioners seethed that Law ""still didn't get it."", ""These are not easy days to serve in the pastoral role that is mine,"" he allowed at a special Mass in Boston in April 2002., It was only after almost a year, when even his own priests were publicly calling on him to quit, that Law did so after 19 years as head of the Boston Archdiocese. Pope John Paul II accepted his resignation., ""To all those who have suffered from my shortcomings and mistakes, I both apologize and from them beg forgiveness,"" he said in a statement announcing his resignation. ""The particular circumstances of this time suggest a quiet departure. Please keep me in your prayers."", It was a shattering fall from grace., ""This was a man who came to Boston with great promise and hope, and people were talking about him being the first American pope,"" recalled attorney Eric MacLeish, who represented hundreds of clergy abuse victims and made the once-venerated and powerful cardinal squirm through days of depositions., ""He ended up in disgrace,"" MacLeish said., Law also left behind parishioners in a crisis of faith, and a church in financial crisis. The archdiocese would ultimately sell some of its most valuable real estate, including the cardinal's residence, to pay about $85 million in settlements to more than 500 victims., In 2003, Massachusetts Attorney General Thomas Reilly issued a scathing report saying ""the mistreatment of children was so massive and so prolonged that it borders on the unbelievable."" The report estimated that nearly 800 children had been abused by at least 237 priests over a period of six decades., ""Time after time ... when [senior clergy] were tested ... and faced with the choice between protecting children or protecting the reputation of the church and the priest abusers, they chose secrecy,"" Reilly said. ""In effect, they sacrificed children for many, many years."", While Reilly said the archbishop could not be prosecuted under the weak laws in place at the time, the attorney general said Law ""bears the ultimate responsibility"" for what happened. Reilly added that Law did not ""bear sole responsibility."", Indeed, it would come out later that countless others in the church transgressed as well. But James Post, who founded the lay activist group Voice of the Faithful in response to the scandal, said Law will be remembered for the sins of them all., ""He was the poster child for a church that was in denial and refused to acknowledge the facts of this terrible abuse,"" said Post., The scandal eclipses Law's long career as a minister and self-described ""meddler"" in politics. He was as well-connected in Washington, D.C., as he was in Rome and outspoken on everything from abortion and affordable housing to foreign policy., He was a staunch advocate for immigrants and the poor and having started his career in Mississippi in the 1960s, he was a champion for civil rights and better race relations. Law was also known for his ecumenical work, building bridges to the Protestant and Jewish communities., But David G. Clohessy, who was national director of the victims' advocacy group, Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said Law's legacy will forever be stained by his failure to protect his flock., ""Bishops' No. 1 goal is to follow the example of Jesus Christ, safeguarding the most vulnerable,"" he said, fighting back tears more than a decade after the scandal broke., ""I get choked up about this because imagine how this would be different had Cardinal Law said [to church officials] 'You've got to report anything you know or suspect,'""  Clohessy said., Born in Mexico, to an Air Force pilot and a mother who converted to Catholicism, Law was known as a stalwart of Catholic orthodoxy. His desire to guard against dissent led him to be influential in the creation of the Catechism of the Catholic Church., While he struck many as autocratic and arrogant, Law saw himself as a loyal servant, defending the church and its top-down hierarchy, according to James Bretzke, Boston College professor of moral theology., ""He considered himself to be a prince of the church and responsible for upholding the dignity of the church and protecting it as an institution,"" said Bretzke. ""I think that was part of his overall corporate mentality."", With time, some people are hoping the cardinal will come to be seen in a more sympathetic light, as a product of a different era., ""I personally don't believe he could possibly have been indifferent to the children,"" said the Rev. Joseph M. Hennessey, who has known Law since the early 1980s, adding that in the priesthood, as in other walks of life, there was a time when people ""would be kind of slapped on the wrists, so to speak, for these kinds of crimes."", Law, ""like so many people, came to believe that you could just send a priest away to a treatment facility and as long as he came back with a good report, then he was ready to be thrown back into the front lines,"" Hennessey said. ""And then [he] found out the hard way that that didn't work."", Law had barely been seen or heard since he left Boston for the Vatican in 2004, facing potential criminal charges. At the Holy See, he served as archpriest of a basilica until 2011. His last years were likely filled with both pain and penance., As Boston businessman, philanthropist and former Law confidant Jack Connors, notes, Catholicism teaches that all sins can be forgiven. ""I think a lot of us have crossed a bridge here, and forgiven Cardinal Law's decisions that put children in harm's way,"" he said. ""But I don't think any of us are ever going to forget it."", The ultimate judgment, Connors added, will come from a higher authority., Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.]"
25,[Walter Robinson On Bernard Law's Legacy In Boston And Beyond],"[Walter Robinson, editor at large at The Boston Globe, joined WGBH's Morning Edition to discuss Boston Cardinal Bernard Law's legacy and the sex abuse scandal he covered up. , The below transcript has been edited for clarity., Joe Mathieu: You're listening to WGBH's Morning Edition., The disgraced archbishop of Boston Cardinal Bernard Law has died. Law became the head of Boston's archdiocese in 1984 and for the next 17 years would be the country's most influential church figure. He was beloved in this city, Boston Magazine ranked him fourth on its power list back in 2001. How long ago that seems., An investigation by The Boston Globe Spotlight Team, of course, would change that. Their Pulitzer Prize reporting exposed a sexual abuse scandal that rattled the church and revealed that Law had protected dozens of clergy accused of child molestation. The team of investigative reporters was led by Walter Robinson, editor at large at The Boston Globe and he joins us now. Walter welcome to WGBH's Morning Edition., Walter Robinson: Good morning, Joe., JM: I can't imagine what's going through your mind as you read this headline today., WR: Well, you know, the cardinal as we've known has been ill for quite some time. So his death does not come as a surprise., Perhaps it's less of a surprise, and more of a reminder of the trauma that has beset the church since 2002, not just in Boston but in virtually every archdiocese around the world, where similar crimes, cover-ups of thousands and thousands of priests who molested children, as the church hid their crimes and in effect enabled the abuse to go on for decades., JM: With the amount of time that you put into covering this story, is there a sense of finality?, WR: No there isn't. This is a hackneyed phrase but I think somehow this is the end of the beginning of this story. The scandal continues, revelations continue in many places around the world including in the United States. The church's efforts at reform seem to have come off the rails, most of the time in most places, and as tragic a figure as Cardinal Law was, his death is another reminder to us that he was essentially the product of a cookie cutter that produced scores of cardinals of his generation, all of whom did the same thing., They all tried to hide the abuse, they all refused to bring the perpetrators to civil authorities unless forced to. They all moved priests from one parish to another, so their crimes would not be uncovered. And the result was horrific. In Boston, as you know, more than 10 percent of priests who served over a 60-year period had been credibly accused of abusing children. And, I mean, that's a tragedy from which the church may never recover., JM: Does this also not remind us of the number of years he walked and lived freely in Rome without punishment?, WR: Well he was, he lived in disgrace, and I suppose I think of him sometimes a little bit like Richard Nixon. He was a man who had the ultimate power of the church in America. He was a senior American cardinal. He was a friend and adviser to presidents. He was sometimes talked about as the likely first American cardinal. And because of his misdeeds in Boston, he lost all of that. So whatever cushy position he had in Rome, and they certainly gave him one, it was for him a fall from grace that was absolute and deserved. And the fact that the church gave him such a comfortable position in Rome is in itself an acknowledgment that the church and its leaders in the Vatican knew that he was basically taking a bullet for the team. That he merely did what all of them did. It's just that he was the first one to get caught in a wholesale way., JM: Walter Robinson, when you look back at the work you did on this, that of course led to the downfall of the cardinal, that was eventually turned into a movie, is that the defining moment of your career?, WR: Well, I think certainly the the work that we did, the reporting that we did back in, from 2001 to 2003, was far and away the most potent story that the newspaper has ever encountered. You know, for reporters that sometimes is a little dumb luck involved in that. You know we started out looking at just one priest, Father John Geoghan, and because there were four of us digging deep on this, within a week or so we found out that the problem was much bigger, that there were a whole bunch of priests who had done the same thing, and their crimes had been covered up., And at the time we thought it was a dozen priests, and by the time we began to publish we we knew it was already over 100, and it ended up in Boston at 250. And as soon, as you'll remember, as soon as we began to publish, it was the dawn of the Internet age and we immediately began to get e-mails from victims all over the world. Within a day we had e-mails from as far away as Australia from victims of priests saying please write about my story., JM: It was portrayed by Michael Keaton in the movie. Walter Robinson, of The Boston Globe Spotlight Team, there are few people we wanted to talk with more than you at this moment, we thank you for sharing insights on WGBH's Morning Edition., WR: My pleasure, Joe.]"
26,[Rhode Island Jewelry: One Company's Story Of 21st Century Survival ],"[There nothing from the outside of the unremarkable, industrial building in East Providence that houses LDC, Inc., that even hints at the sprawling, gilded, controlled-chaos inside. There are more chains, beads and pendants that you can imagine. Designers sit at artfully cluttered desks, sketching with pencil on paper. Hundreds of metal baubles stew in metal vats, being cleaned and polished. And George Cantara sits at one of a few dozen hulking orange and green machines with a tweezers, plucking and placing delicate steel hoops., Cantara presses two buttons, and with a huge thump, a metal die strikes down on the hoop, leaving it looking a little more decorative.  , ""It’s a steel hoop that we’re embossing a pattern in the bottom of,"" explained Ed DeCristofaro, who now runs this company that his father started more than 30 years ago. ""Back in the late 80s and early 90s we made all these different dies with different patterns if you look on the shelf behind you."", These made-in-the-USA hoop earrings are considered fashion jewelry — or costume jewelry. They are the inexpensive-to-medium priced bracelets, bangles or necklaces you might buy at a mall kiosk — or from a retailer, like J. Crew or Anne Taylor. For much of the 20th century, if you were you were buying these kinds of adornments, chances are they were made in Rhode Island., ""Providence was once the jewelry capital of the world,"" said DeCristofaro. ""Between Providence and Attleboro, absolutely the jewelry capital of the world — fashion jewelry capital of the world."", In the mid-1980s, America’s smallest state boasted some 25,000 jewelry workers at 900 companies pumping out a million pieces of jewelry a week — about 80 percent of all fashion jewelry manufactured in the country, , ""It’s a very, very hard-working industry,"" said DeCristofaro. ""No one in this industry makes money without working hard and nobody survives without working hard."", Hearing DeCristofaro talk about the industry he’s been in since the age of 15 — and its history here in Rhode Island — is a bit listening to a Bruce Springsteen song., ""Model makers were third and fourth generation,"" he explained. ""Their great-grandfather, their grandfather, their fathers were model makers. What were they gonna be? A model maker. It was already predetermined for them. And it provided them good livings."", And true to the Springsteen form, the hard times came: the post-NAFTA exodus, and the rise of cheap manufacturing overseas that devastated the industry., ""The industry changed,"" said DeCristofaro. ""They worked as hard as they could, and it still changed on them. Some of these guys they were older and they kept looking at it like, 'It’s leaving, it’s leaving, it’s leaving.'”, But DeCristofaro was still young and determined that LDC could survive. And that meant changing, too., ""It was a constant evolution,"" he said. ""We started making tools and dies for people, and [when] that was changing we started making component parts and pieces and selling those to other manufacturers."", Today, a nimble company of 40 employees, they do it all. Their chief business is the design and manufacture of finished jewelry products for name-brand retailers. , ""Most women out there probably own many, many pairs of LDC hoops — they just don’t know it,"" said Executive Vice President Jennifer Brousseau. ""They’ve been wearing it under another brand name."", LDC is able to compete with cheaper overseas companies in part because some customers still want products made in the USA., And some of their customers simply want flexibility and fast turnaround, which Alexys Garrepy, director of sales for LCD, says is the company's specialty. , ""A lot of other places I worked before, you worked with a lot of overseas vendors, you weren’t able to be quick with things,"" she said. ""LDC is very quick. It’s a huge, huge selling point for us."" , But retail is also transforming. And so LDC’s newest evolution is their own line created by Broussard and Garrepy, called Alexys Ryan. It's sold direct to consumers, primarily online., “It’s a simple line with clean, recognizable for icons for pendants, and the comfort was really important to us,” said Brousseau., “And affordable,” added Garrepy. “We wanted to make sure we were affordable.”, And to help keep it affordable, much of their Alexis Ryan line is made in China., Such is the picture of 21st century manufacturing in America. Drill presses from the early 1900s and 3D printers are both used to make a bracelet. Products manufactured in China help keep a small company afloat, so they can make other products right here in the U.S., As for whether jewelry’s future in Rhode Island looks as bright as its ""glory days?"" Maybe not. Still, DeCristofaro says this is the place to be., ""There’s new energy in it but you gotta go find the new energy. It’s not gonna come to you,"" he said. ""You really need those core competencies, and they are here. The finishers are here, the platers are here, some of the stone suppliers, they’re still here. So you need to be here.""       , Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"

You almost expect him to pull up in a sleigh. Instead, he relies on his Hyundai sedan to get him to the suburban homes where he loads the trunk with donated dolls, toy trucks and warm winter coats. It’s all part of an operation his wife, Mary Ellen Hussey, runs from the front room of their temporary home., “Put it up here,” she calls, “I’ve got to start sorting some of this stuff.”, For nearly 20 years, Mary Ellen Hussey has been collecting presents for Housing Families, Inc, a Malden nonprofit that helps homeless families. Over the years her reach and reputation have grown. Emails often land in her inbox requesting help., “It’s two boys, one’s 10 and the other’s going to be five,” says Hussey, as she reads aloud from an email sent by a grandmother., Hussey sends out her own emails seeking donations. Friends forward the requests to more friends. It’s a kind of viral generosity., “Yes, love it, love it,” exclaims Hussey, as she reads an incoming email from someone offering to donate presents., Hussey calls her network “email angels""., “All I do is organize it and I pick it up and I deliver it. That’s it, that’s all I do,” she says, before acknowledging, “It is a little bit of work.”, It's hours of work. And, as Christmas approaches, the time commitment increases. Hussey says she never makes a promise she can't keep. Yet, when she hears about a family in need, she always finds a way to help. Some years she's procured presents for up to 250 kids. , This year, it's been tough to find the time to reach out to the email angels. The Hussey's have been struggling with the same thing that consumes many of the families they help: trying to keep a roof over their heads.   , A car exploded in their next door neighbor’s driveway last March and set the Hussey’s Everett home on fire.,  “There was myself and my husband, there was my daughter,” Mary Ellen Hussey says, standing on the charred remains of her back porch. “There was six of us, and we had nowhere to go.”, , They got out safely, but just about everything they owned is gone. The family, including two grandsons, spent three months in a motel. , “It’s been a rough year,” she says.  , As he put his arm around her, her husband echoes the sentiment. “Yes, it has,"" he says. ""It’s been a rough year.”, Insurance money only goes so far, and for the Husseys, it has taken a long time to kick in. Nine months after the fire, melted siding is peeling off the outside walls. The wood frame is burnt black. Anyone would understand if this holiday the Husseys focused on their own misfortune. But it’s only made them more determined than ever to help others., “Going through this, I know how hard it is and the last thing you need to worry about is Santa going to find me,” says Mary Ellen Hussey. “How do you say, ‘I’m sorry honey, Santa can’t find you today because we’re not in a house?’”, They don’t know when their own house will again be home. So, for now, the Husseys are spending big money renting a small apartment. But they figure a lot of people — especially kids — have it worse., And as she admires a set of Barbie dolls that came in with the latest haul of donations, Mary Ellen Hussey knows she has something no tragedy can take away: the power to tap the keys of her well-worn laptop and send out a summons., Her email angels always deliver. , Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

She was thrilled to meet Mayor Marty Walsh before she filled up her shopping cart at the Target store at South Bay. Collins received a $100 gift card, paid for with donations., “I got my little sister some clothes and then I got clothes for me and some toys,” she explained., Collins and more than 300 other Boston area children flooded the store, each paired with an officer. She was paired with Boston police detective Anthony Williams, a 20-year veteran of the department., For Collins’ family, this year’s program was especially timely. Her grandmother, Robin Gibbons, who is taking care of her, said it has been a rough year., “I was kind struggling this year for Christmas because I am not working right now,” Gibbons explained., Boston Police started “Shop with a Cop” as a way to help families in need and to build relationships between kids and officers. It is modeled on programs started in other cities about two decades ago., “I’m from the city. I grew up in the city so I find something like this to be a blessing for us and an opportunity to give back,” Williams explained. “Growing up, I didn’t have a chance for opportunities like this to meet police officers for who they really are. In this day and time, it’s really important to develop that type of communication and understanding.”, With communication, understanding, and an eagle-eye for gifts, Madison said he won the 12-year-old over., Thanks to her shopping partner — Collins said she found exactly what she was looking for this year., “He helped me find Family Feud the game, and I got everything I wanted,” she said., At the end of the night, Williams picked up the tab for what the gift card didn’t cover., Boston police find participants by giving a number of slots to area schools, community centers and programs. Sometimes, officers pick children who are already in the store, with their parents' permission., Money for the gift cards comes from Target stores, the Police Athletic League, police organizations, several local colleges and other private donors., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"
30,[Does Matt Damon Deserve The Backlash Over His #MeToo Comments?],"[
	There are two kinds of people in this world right now: those who agree with Matt Damon and those who don’t. At least that seems to be the perspective of the hundreds of stories demanding we take sides ever since Damon waded into the #MeToo discussion on ABC’s “Popcorn with Peter Travers” last week. Damon told Travers that he think's ""it's wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories,"" but, he adds ""there's a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation. Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated, without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated.”
	 
	The backlash was swift. Actress Alyssa Milano wrote on Twitter, ""There are different stages of cancer. Some more treatable than others. But it’s still cancer."" And Damon's ex, actress Minnie Driver, wrote, ""You don’t get to tell women that because some guy only showed them their penis their pain isn't as great as a woman who was raped."" But then came articles like the Globe's Joan Vennochi's, arguing ""isn't it better to hear what men have to say, than to tell them to shut up, as Damon was angrily urged to do?

31,[Could #MeToo Prompt A Backlash?],"[Barbara Howard: The ""Me Too"" movement is showing no signs of slowing down, with women coming out with allegations of sexual misconduct against prominent men from many walks of life. It seems like there's a new one each day. But could there be a backlash brewing? One former federal judge, a self-proclaimed feminist, Nancy Gertner, says that the ‘Me Too’ movement is running the risk of getting pushback. Judge Gertner is with me now in the studio to talk about it. Thanks for coming in., Nancy Gertner: Good to be here., Howard: What does ‘Me Too’ mean? Does that mean you were physically sexually assaulted? Does it mean you were raped? Does it mean somebody said something that you found offensive, but they didn't intend for it to be? How do we define what ""Me Too” means?, Gertner: Well that's right, there's a continuum of conduct here, but what is challenging here is that even the most extreme sexual predation was kept under the rug. And so, I understand this reaction completely, but there is a range that goes from what Weinstein is accused of doing, on the one hand, to dirty jokes on the other., Howard: And if a dirty joke can deep-six a man's career, there's going to be a backlash., Gertner: Well what I worry about is that the further we get to that side of the continuum that the backlash here might be, 'Well maybe I don't want to hire women because these issues are going to come up.', Howard: Is there a chance that conflating real bad stuff — the rapists — with an offensive remark made, that it somehow diminishes the really seriously bad stuff?, Gertner: Well it could immunize it. In other words, one of the things that, for example, President Trump said after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape, was that this was locker room talk, as if that was OK. And the more locker room talk from more prominent men that we surface, what I fear is it will immunize those who shouldn't have talked like that to begin with., Howard: The vast majority of women in these situations, if they're lucky, they get to settle and nothing changes, is what I understand., Gertner: And the settlements are confidential, so other women don't have access to them. Even those people have sued — the law has not been particularly helpful. Eighty percent of civil rights cases of all kinds fail in federal court. Many of the women in the Trump case and Weinstein case and Charlie Rose [case] actually had no other place to go. The statute of limitations will have run. These are not necessarily people who were employed, and the best setting for dealing with sexual harassment and sexual abuse is in an employment setting because we have rules about it. The campus situation has Title 9 protections for women students. So what's interesting about these accusations is that many of these women had no other place to go, but the front pages of the newspapers or CNN., Howard: In recent days, there have been quite a few men who've been removed from their positions at work based on — nobody knows., Gertner: How much of this is played out in the public is one thing, but you would hope that they would know the accusations against them. You would hope that before anything is announced, there is an investigation. And you would hope that if the investigation proves that these were unfounded, that they come back., Howard: Some of the local cases — Leonard Lopate in New York City and others — it seems as though people were unaware of any kinds of problems until the institution made it public before an investigation., Gertner: Right, that is problematic. That's very troubling, because it was certainly available for the institution to do their own investigation before someone is publicly shamed, which is really what this is., Howard: So what happens, though, when the investigation concludes and the person who was accused is found in the clear — but their reputation, how did they get that back?, Gertner: Very difficult. Usually the accusers, oftentimes, the accusers’ identities are kept confidential. So how do you get cleared of something like this where one side is known and the other side is confidential?, Howard: Isn't there a right to face your accuser?, Gertner: We're dealing in a lawless zone here. We're dealing with naming and shaming. We're dealing with people who are making accusations in public and not in a court of law. So the obligation to fairness is the obligation that the companies may feel, but not necessarily anything that the law requires. I suppose there could be a counter suit if someone is exonerated for defamation or whatever, but one way of looking at this — and I'm ambivalent, I mean, you're hearing my ambivalent in my comments. One way of looking at this is it this is a swing to address really horrific kinds of abuse, namely Weinstein and even Charlie Rose, etc. And it's a swing in one direction and there are bound to be casualties when that happens. And the question now is how do we swing back so that we have a more appropriate response. That's what I think is going on. You have people being swept under this bus because for years, it has been kept quiet. So it's not an inappropriate reaction to that, but I wonder if there shouldn't be a corrective, too., Howard: Thanks so much for coming in., Gertner: Thank you., Howard: That's retired federal judge Nancy Gertner., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

34,[Author Celeste Ng On Her New Novel 'Little Fires Everywhere'],"[In Celeste Ng's new novel, ""Little Fires Everywhere,"" a quiet and well-ordered Ohio suburb gets turned upside when a single mother and her daughter move in — and a debate over a transracial adoption splits the town in two., Ng, also the author of the bestselling novel ""Everything I Never Told You,"" joined Boston Public Radio to discuss the new book and her own experience growing up in the meticulously ordered suburb that inspired it. A partial transcript of the conversation follows., MARGERY EAGAN: Give people a bigger picture of what you're getting at in ""Little Fires Everywhere."", CELESTE NG:  ""Little Fires Everywhere"" takes place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, which is a suburb of Cleveland. It's actually my own hometown. It follows two families: one, the Richardsons, who have lived there for several generations, they've got four teenagers, mom and dad, in a typical nuclear suburban family, and they're very much of that community; and then a mother and daughter who come in from out of town and stir up some trouble for them. The complications they cause for each other as the town is sort of split over a transracial adoption, the adoption of a baby. These two families end up on opposite sides and start digging into each others' pasts with disastrous consequences for everybody., JARED BOWEN: To understand the people of this town, it's great to understand the town. It's fascinating to know you grew up there. Describe for us what it is, how it was planned. It seems ripe for a writer., NG: Shaker Heights was one of the first planned communities in the United States. It's on the east side of Cleveland, it's a commuter suburb, and it was a great place to grow up. I loved growing up there, and I still have really fond memories of the town. It prides itself on being very idyllic, very beautiful, very progressive, and very racially integrated, and it is all of those things. But the way that they get there is through planning out everything. So for a long time, the city had rules about what colors you could paint your house, so every house would be harmonious — not the same, but harmonious with all the other houses. They had a lot of different rules. There are still rules about how often you have to mow your lawn, how you can't put your garbage at the curb and make the street look messy., EAGAN: Hold on. So that's really true, what you talked about in the book, if you had more than six inches of lawn, somebody called you or came over? , NG: We definitely went away to Hong Kong one summer to visit family, we were away for about three weeks, and we came back and the city had mowed our lawn, and they had sent us a bill because the lawn had grown too tall, and we couldn't have that. So they mow your lawn and send you a bill because they've done yard work for you., And the garbage trucks, as I said in the book, it's really true: you're not supposed to put your garbage at the front curb because then the street will look messy on garbage day. You have to keep your garbage in the back of the house, and the city has these very small garbage trucks, about the size of a golf cart, that just zip down every driveway and pick up the garbage in the back and carry it up to the regular garbage truck in the front. So you never see garbage at the front of the house. At the time I thought this was normal, and then I went elsewhere and noticed that not many people do this. ...It was garbage day yesterday where I live, and I was thinking, 'Well, the garbage cans are out on the street — it does look really messy!', BOWEN: One other element of the planned community that struck me — and this really comes to the surface with two of the characters in your book — is where people of less means, how they have to live. They're almost kind of hidden, in a way., NG: Yes. It comes from a good place, in a way. The community is very aware of class distinctions, but the way they choose to try and mitigate those distinctions is, in some ways, making people live in, say, a two-family house, who are often renters, pretend that they're not. There are several areas in which there are a lot of duplexes, and the rule is they have to look like a single-family house from the outside. So here in Boston, it's pretty easy to tell if you go to Dorchester or even parts of Cambridge or Somerville, it's easy to tell when it's a two-family house, because often there are two doors. It's easy to tell if it's a triple-decker because you can see that there are three apartments that look exactly like each other above, and sometimes the people who live in those houses don't agree, and the house is painted two different colors, that happens every now and then. In Shaker Heights, the rule is the house has to look like a single-family. There can only be one front door. There can only be one mailbox. There's only one front door light. The two apartments aren't necessarily the same, because from the outside you don't want the house to look like it's been split in half. And so, it comes from this good impulse of saying, 'We don't want people to feel like they're lesser because they're renting or because they can't afford a whole house,' but it's an odd way to solve the problem because it's saying 'We're going to make everyone pretend they're living in a single-family house.' ..., BOWEN: How did you arrive at this concept that you explore in the book, of one family rubbing up against another, and one family really feeling — and, in some regard, made to feel — 'other,' because of where they live, and how they're treated?, NG: It always happens organically for me. I started from wanting to write about this community, because it was so intriguing to me. It was both that it had this progressive inclusiveness and also these blind spots that communities have. I thought, 'Let me think of families who would live there,' and that's how I came up with the Richardsons, who had been there for a long time. They're nuclear, the mother and father are white-collar, well-to-do. Then I thought, 'Well, who is going to come in and stir up trouble for them?' That's when I came up with this other family who, as you said, are the opposite. They move around a lot. She's a single mom. She's an artist, so she doesn't have the most stable of careers, and so on. She's very secretive about who she is, whereas in Shaker Heights and for this other family, roots are such a big thing. As a writer, once you get those two components, you put them together and you see what happens. , Click the audio player above to hear more from Celeste Ng. This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"
35,"[After 30 years denying he was a murderer, Darrell Jones will get a new trial]","[Darrell Jones has steadfastly maintained his innocence in a murder that has kept him in prison for more than three decades. On Tuesday, on his third attempt, the 50-year-old Boston man learned he would get a new trial. , After a three-month review of the case, Superior Court Judge Thomas F. McGuire Jr. overturned Jones’s conviction for the 1985 murder of Guillermo Rodriguez in a Brockton parking lot, saying the case was tainted by racial bias and misconduct. , “Since the defendant did not receive a fair trial, his conviction cannot stand,’’ McGuire wrote in a 39-page ruling released Tuesday. , Beth Stone, a spokeswoman from the Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office, said the office is reviewing the decision “and will determine our next course of action.” , Jones’s attorney, Lisa Kavanaugh, said she was notified of the decision Tuesday morning and drove directly to the state’s maximum security prison in Shirley to tell her longtime client the news. She plans to file a motion Wednesday morning for his immediate release. , “He was quite overcome with emotion,’’ said Kavanaugh, director of the Innocence Program at the state public defender’s office. “It was pretty wonderful.” , Jones filed a motion to reopen his case in 2015 based on allegations that police tampered with a videotaped interview of a key witness to remove exculpatory evidence. The tape, shown at his trial, was pivotal because none of the eyewitnesses testified in court that they were sure Jones was the shooter. , McGuire, who now presides in Bristol County Superior Court, is hearing Jones’s case because he was seated in Plymouth when the motion was first filed. He wrote that he first learned of allegations of racial bias as part of a 2016
 investigation published by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and WBUR public radio. , Juror Eleanor Urbati, a white Hingham resident who always regretted convicting Jones, told NECIR that two jurors had told her they thought the defendant was guilty because he was black. , In September, McGuire 
summoned Urbati to court as part of a reexamination of the Jones verdict in what is believed to be the first such review in Massachusetts since the US Supreme Court ruled in March that a trial judge must pry into typically secret discussions if there is evidence of racial bias. McGuire Jr. also interviewed three other jurors who couldn’t remember and allegations of racism during deliberations of the all-white panel. , McGuire said in his decision that although other jurors did not confirm Urbati’s testimony, he believed she was “was very precise and consistent in her description.” , “It was clear” the case had “weighed heavily” on Urbati over decades, he wrote. , McGuire said that racial allegations are important in a state with a “long, sad history of racial bias that persists today.” The unidentified juror was “racially biased” and “he was not joking. He was not being sarcastic,’’ the judge wrote. “The defendant did not receive a trial before an impartial jury.” , McGuire also wrote that he supported Jones allegations that a videotape recording of witness Terri Lynn Starks had been manipulated. Jones claimed police tampered with the videotape played in the courtroom, in which a brief segment of the “The Phil Silvers Show,” a 1950s send-up of Army life, suddenly appeared in the middle of the interview. , The lead investigator on the case, Brockton police detective Joseph Smith, called the glitch an honest pre-trial mistake in handling the tape. But forensic specialists and lawyers working for Jones, using technology not available at the time of the trial, said the recording was not the original and was missing up to two minutes of the interview. , To examine the allegations, McGuire summoned Smith, now retired, to testify. , Smith told the court that he did not have “the technical ability” to delete material. But McGuire determined that testimony to be false. , He said Smith knew how to edit the video and provided false testimony to the jury — but did not conclude he was the one who manipulated the tape. He said Smith, realizing the tape had been altered, feared that admitting this to the jury “would appear highly suspicious” and instead gave a false explanation. , McGuire determined that if the jury had known of Smith’s “false testimony and that the police edited the recording” the jury may have ruled differently. “Because Det. Smith’s false testimony could have affected the jury’s judgment, a new trial is required,” he wrote. , Smith, now 76 years old and reached at his home, said he was surprised by the judge’s decision. He said he worked at the Brockton Police Department for 30 years. “First time I have ever been called a liar,’’ he said. , Kavanaugh said the judge’s decision was remarkable because judges don’t often recognize “that police officers are not above lying and racial bias is a profound problem in our system.” , This story was co-published with the Boston Globe., Jenifer B.

37,[FULL SHOW: Concealed Carry Bill; Plastic Bag Ban; Secret Search For UFOs],"[It's one of the most controversial bills in Congress. After House passage earlier this month, it's up to the Senate whether federal concealed carry reciprocity will become the law of the land. If so, any state that lets licensed owners carry concealed guns — like Massachusetts — would also have to honor the concealed carry licenses of any other state, including those with far less-strict firearm rules. Last week on Boston Public Radio, Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans said that this bill is “ridiculous” and is “the last thing [we] should be doing.” Adam Reilly was joined by John Rosenthal, co-founder of Stop Handgun Violence, and Pierre Roberto Salomon, founder of Salomon Firearms Training to discuss the issue., The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which passed the House earlier this month, is stirring up controversy among constitutional scholars. The bill would require states to recognize the concealed-carry standards of all other states. Although the second amendment lays out ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms,"" some argue the bill runs afoul of the tenth amendment, which deals with states’ rights. Another constitutional concern here in Boston is the new ban on single-use plastic bags, signed into law last week by Mayor Marty Walsh. Supporters say the ban will cut down on the amount of plastic that ends up in the environment, but others are worried about the cost to consumers. Former state senator Jack Hart, now a representative for the packaging company Novolex, argues the fee is not only burdensome, but unconstitutional. Adam Reilly was joined by Suffolk University Law professor, Renée Landers to discuss the legal issues., A recent New York Times investigation uncovered the Department of Defense program that was tasked with investigating UFO sightings and encounters by military aircraft between 2007-2012.

 Attorneys Anthony Fuller, Jody Newman, and Natashia Tidwell of Hogan Lovells will take the lead in the Senate Ethics Committee special investigation of Sen. Stanley Rosenberg. [Photos: Courtesy/Hogan Lovells], The legal team will now begin a review into allegations published in the Boston Globe that Rosenberg's husband Bryon Hefner made unwanted sexual advances on at least four men who do business on Beacon Hill, and claimed to wield influence over policy decisions in the Senate., Fuller was part of the federal prosecution team that convicted DiMasi of accepting kickbacks in exchange for steering state software contracts to a client of his associates., As an assistant U.S. attorney on the organized crime strike force unit in 2009, Tidwell was part of a pair that prosecuted the case against alleged La Cosa Nostra underboss Carmen DiNunzio, who was sentenced to six years in federal prison after pleading guilty to conspiring to bribe a state official to obtain a contract to provide loam to the Massachusetts Highway Department for the Big Dig., Newman, according to her biography on the Hogan Lovells website, is ""skilled at investigating high-risk claims in the workplace and on college campuses"" and has ""developed and conducted individualized employment law and professionalism trainings for businesses large and small."", ""The Committee is confident that these well-qualified lawyers – who have extensive experience investigating alleged misconduct in both the public and private sectors – will fully and fairly conduct the investigation ordered by the Senate,"" the Ethics Committee, chaired by Sen. Michael Rodrigues of Westport, said in a statement., Prior to the announcement, one state senator not on the committee had suggested that it would look to bring in someone from out-of-state with no ties to Beacon Hill., The Senate Ethics Committee launched its inquiry on Dec. 5, and put a two-week timeline on the hiring of an investigator – a self-imposed deadline that it met with the hiring Monday night. Though there is no timeline for the attorneys to conduct the inquiry, the Ethics Committee said it has asked that it be done ""as soon as practicable, without sacrificing thoroughness or attention to detail."", At its initial meeting, the six-member ethics panel put a heavy emphasis on making sure victims felt comfortable speaking with investigators and confident that they would not pay a professional price for coming forward., ""I am deeply disturbed by these allegations which jeopardize the integrity of the Senate. Sexual harassment and assault have no place in the Massachusetts state Senate or any workplace. I am committed to a fair and thorough review of the facts as well as a process that ensures confidentiality for any person who has any information to report on sexual harassment or sexual assaults,"" Rodrigues said., The investigative team in in the process of setting up a toll-free phone number and email address for people to provide relevant information., The other members of the committee are Democrats William Brownsberger, Cynthia Creem and Cindy Friedman and Republican Sens. Bruce Tarr and Richard Ross., The committee is now expected to largely step back and let the investigator take over., ""Our role as committee members is not to conduct the investigation, but rather set in pace the mechanisms for discovering the truth and allowing this investigator to proceed without delay or any impediments by this committee,"" Rodrigues said at the initial meeting., The committee said Monday that it does not anticipate making any other public statements until the independent investigators have completed their work and submitted a report to the committee for review., The investigator, according to an order adopted by the Senate initiating the probe, is to have ""full access"" to Rosenberg's office and his staff, and the Ethics Committee was authorized to compel witness testimony and the production of ""books and papers and such other records"" by summons., Once the investigator completes his or her work, it will up to the Ethics Committee to review the findings and make a recommendation to the full Senate. The options for the committee would be to take no action at all, to reprimand Rosenberg, or to recommend expulsion.]"

	It's one of the most controversial bills in Congress. After House passage earlier this month, it's up to the Senate whether federal concealed carry reciprocity will become the law of the land. If so, any state that lets licensed owners carry concealed guns — like Massachusetts — would also have to honor the concealed carry licenses of any other state, including those with far less-strict firearm rules. Last week on Boston Public Radio, Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans said that this bill is “ridiculous” and is “the last thing [we] should be doing.”

41,[Are Concealed Carry Reciprocity and Plastic Bag Bans Constitutional?],"[
	The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which passed the House earlier this month, is stirring up controversy among constitutional scholars. The bill would require states to recognize the concealed-carry standards of all other states. Although the second amendment lays out ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms,"" some argue the bill runs afoul of the tenth amendment, which deals with states’ rights.
	 
	Another constitutional concern here in Boston is the new ban on single-use plastic bags, signed into law last week by Mayor Marty Walsh. Supporters say the ban will cut down on the amount of plastic that ends up in the environment, but others are worried about the cost to consumers. Former state senator Jack Hart, now a representative for the packaging company Novolex, argues the fee is not only burdensome, but unconstitutional.

44,"[The Battle Over Net Neutrality Isn't Over Yet, Says ACLU Massachusetts Director]","[Last week, the Federal Communications Commission made the controversial decision to overturn net neutrality rules. Net neutrality rules prohibit internet service providers from prioritizing certain businesses over others, for example, over political views or pricing mechanisms that favor established corporations., But Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, says the fight is far from over., ""The battle's not over yet, but it's a tremendously important battle, both for democracy and for an innovation economy,"" Rose said, noting that the ruling could be especially damaging to states like Massachusetts that have a healthy start-up landscape., ""For people who care about an open internet and frankly, democracy, we need to fight back.

The Congressional Review Act allows Congress to undo federal regulations with a majority vote. , ""Can we peel off some members of Congress who understand that this is actually a danger to their state's economies?

45,[How Senior Centers Are Adapting To A New Generation],"[In a function room at the Barnstable Senior Center, Carl Bertelsman holds an iPad in one hand as he demonstrates the settings on the device to a room full of seniors., Some of the 13 people in the room say they want to learn how to work iPads and iPhones to keep up with their social media savvy grandkids. But a class on mobile devices is the last thing the center might have offered only a decade ago — the center has been broadening its programs and activities to attract people who otherwise might never set foot inside., “Senior centers around the country have been steadily changing, and we are one of many that are trying to figure out how we evolve to continue to meet the needs of a whole different generation of older adults,” said Madeline Noonan, the center’s director., The center is a bright, airy facility with about 20,000 square feet of space. Noonan has overseen an evolution at the facility during her 10 years there, introducing high-impact exercise classes like Zumba, hula-hoop classes, and an African drumming class., , According to Donna Popkin, the director of member services at the Massachusetts Councils on Aging, the shift began in the early 2000s, with a new focus on wellness and health. And as baby boomers age, there’s also been a greater focus on things like estate and tax planning, or how to enroll in Medicare for the first time., “Many of them are younger seniors — they might be early 60s — caregivers for older parents … and so they’re looking for resources,” Popkin said., Changing attitudes are also evident at the national level. Last January, the Administration on Aging, a federal agency, changed its name to the Administration on Community Living., Gary Sylvester is one of roughly 2,000 people who take advantage of programs at the Barnstable Senior Center. He’s been on the Cape for 30 years, and says getting new people in the door is key — especially those who may initially bristle at the idea of coming., Madeline Noonan wants to upend that mindset. She’s spearheading a campaign to change the name of the facility by removing the word 'senior.' A similar effort about a decade ago fizzled out. But times have changed, and Noonan is hoping that now may finally be the right moment., , “Plymouth recently changed their name…they are now the Center for Active Living,” she said. “There’s no age associated with that, because everybody’s aging … you know, from the moment we’re born, we’re aging.”, Five years ago, Plymouth built the community a new 18,000-square foot facility, which opened up the opportunity to rebrand the center with a new name., “If we’re gonna look at changing the face of aging in Plymouth, this is the time to do it,"" said Jennifer Young, director of Plymouth's Center for Active Living. ""You know, we need to change our name, change what we’re calling ourselves."", She says the name change campaign has been slowly evolving from the talking stages to reality., “It’s taken that long … from, sort of, the whispers in the hallway of, ‘We’re actively living, we’re not aging, we’re actively living,’"" Young said., Back at the Barnstable Senior Center, Bobbi Field of West Hyannisport participated in a cardio drumming routine, working with instructor Maria Zombas., , “I like something uplifting and fun — a lot of positive energy,"" Field said. ""You know, it’s not just for “senior” seniors. I’m gonna be 70 soon, so I’m maybe one of the younger seniors, I think.” ]"

48,"[State To Subsidize Burning Wood Pellets, But Is It Environmentally Friendly?]","[New state regulations going into effect Friday will provide new state subsidies for using a range of renewable technologies and fuels. But the change is raising questions among some environmentalists about what it means to be renewable., The rule change is the result of legislation passed in 2014 and expands what qualifies for the alternative energy portfolio standards, giving credits and subsidies for fuel cells, solar thermal, heat pumps, geothermal, and the one that’s proven to be a bit controversial —biomass fuel., For the most part, that means burning wood pellets that are manufactured to create heat and energy. The alternative energy credits aren’t for people heating their homes — they’re intended for larger scale operations, like schools, hospitals or some industrial places., In a sense, wood is renewable since trees eventually regrow. “Renewable sounds wonderful,"" said William Moomaw, co-director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University. “And people have always equated renewable with low or no carbon. And that’s not the case with bioenergy. To cut down trees and then burn them puts carbon dioxide into the atmosphere immediately.”, But Patrick Woodcock of the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) says the state is interested in subsidizing wood as an energy source because it’s replacing fossil fuels., “In our rules there has to be a determination that this is 50 percent lower than oil and natural gas emissions,” Woodcock said. “Biomass really provides, along with geothermal [and] solar thermal, a real way to lower emissions from the oil and natural gas that we’re using to heat our buildings.”, , The rules also state that the wood has to come from sustainable forestry practices., But Caitlin Peale Sloan with the Conservation Law Foundation says the way the rules are drafted doesn’t go far enough. “If there aren't strong enough standards on these subsidies then it could go to someone burning whole trees for fuel, and that has a huge negative carbon impact,” Peale Sloan said., Patrick Woodcock of the DOER says these are very strict rules, and the state pays close attention to what the source of the wood is, to ensure that it’s the result of good forestry practices., At New England Wood Pellet in New Hampshire, the largest company in the area creating this kind of fuel, consultant Charlie Niebling says between 70 and 100 percent of their pellets are made from waste byproduct of manufacturing wood products like lumber, furniture and flooring., “We buy their sawdust, their chips, their shavings, the stuff that's left over after they make a product, and that material is considered by definition to be sustainably sourced,” Niebling said.  , A small amount comes from timber harvesting here in New England, Niebling adds. But he says that comes from carefully regulated harvests with good forestry operations., “I think with the safeguards that are in place through this regulation and through the forest harvesting regulations in the state of Massachusetts, I don't think people need to be concerned that this incentive is somehow going to result in widespread deforestation,” Niebling said. “It’s simply not going to happen.”, Patrick Woodcock of the state DOER actually suggested that the rule change could result in more healthy forests in Massachusetts, because if there’s a market here for forest products, people who own forests might be less inclined to sell them off for development. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

50,"[City Winery Opens In Boston, Offering Live Music And Wine]","[WGBH News' Henry Santoro interviews Michael Dorf, the CEO of City Winery, now open in Boston. Below is a lightly edited transcription of the interview., Henry Santoro: Michael Dorf is the founder and CEO of City Winery, a rapidly expanding wine focused restaurant and music venue that's located at One Canal Street in Boston. Boston is the fifth city for City Winery. The others are New York, Nashville, Chicago and Atlanta, and there are several more in the works. And it's my pleasure to welcome Michael Dorf to WGBH and Weekend Edition and to Henry In The Hub. Michael, great to meet you., Michael Dorf: Great to meet you, Henry. You're a legend., HS: As are you, for that matter. Congratulations, first of all, on the Boston location. So let's go back to 1987, the legendary New York club, the Knitting Factory. You co-founded that with your partner; it became known for a very certain type of music. Two [people] that come to mind are John Zorn, and of course, The Lounge Lizards. How would you describe that music, and did it find you or did you find it?, MD: Both. There was a real need in New York for a place that was kind of open to all kinds of things, not even just music, [but] poetry and weird dance performances, and just an open mind. And so, we did both jazz and instrumental. We also did a lot of rock, alternative stuff, the Indigo Girls and Sonic Youth, and Beck's first show. I love it all. My record collection is not as big as your record collection, but I love all kinds of music, and I was just a young kid who wanted to be part of it. I wanted to have that Jack Kerouac kind of existence in the club world, and so, having Allen Ginsburg in the space was, for me, a highlight. I just wanted it all to happen there., HS: And it had that beat feel to it?, MD: That's kind of what we were striving for. You know, it was a struggle, I don't think we ever made any money the whole time. I mean a little bit, but not much. It was not about the money. I didn't have a family and kids, I slept in the back for the first two years to survive., HS: Just as the Knitting Factory represented a type of music and a vibe, does City Winery represent a certain type of music and a vibe, as well?, , MD: Yeah. Some people say it's a Knitting Factory for grownups. It's certainly [a] different life cycle for me and I was building something really for me. I wanted a place that I would love to go to and I've become into wine. And so I want to drink wine in a real glass, not a plastic cup. I want to have a real list, because one day I might be into some old Italian, Sicilian wine and next I want a younger, Willamette Pinot from Oregon. So I wanted that experience, and luckily, there's a lot of other people who share ... those same needs., HS: You've already created this perfect niche for the type of artists that we're talking about., MD: Well the world has changed, as we know, in the last 10 years. It used to be artists would tour to support a record and that's their primary source of income. Now those are meaningless and it's all about live music. Live music has become the precious good, and we've just created a really better mousetrap for the particular artists now that need to work, want to work, and want to be in a real listening room., HS: Michael we are so glad that you are in Boston.

51,[Accidental Gun Deaths Spiked After Sandy Hook],"[Barbara Howard: The shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut was five years ago today. In the aftermath, President Obama offered words of comfort to Newtown and to the nation., SOUND CLIP FROM BARACK OBAMA:, In the hard days to come, that community needs us to be at our best as Americans, and I will do everything in my power as president to help., Howard: But when President Obama pushed for new gun control policies in the wake of Sandy Hook, it triggered an uptick in gun sales. After the shooting in Newtown, three million guns were sold above and beyond what would have been typical for that time period. Sandy Hook cast new light on unintended consequences — inevitable talk about what to do about guns followed by a spike in gun sales., A new study out in the journal ""Science"" goes even further. It links those additional gun sales after Sandy Hook to 60 additional accidental gun deaths, including 20 children. Coincidentally, that is the same number of children who were killed at Sandy Hook. One of the study's authors, Phillip Levine, is in the studio with me. Thanks for coming in., Levine: I'm glad to be here., Howard: Now how do you go about directly attributing those deaths to the upsurge in gun sales after Sandy Hook?, Levine: What we look at in the data is this very large spike in gun sales that took place immediately following Sandy Hook which, essentially, you could think of as a coincidence in terms of timing. And what we look for is right exactly at that time that that spike occurs in sales, do we also happen to see a spike in accidental deaths that occurs in exactly the same time period? And the answer is that we do. And we see a very large spike, something just all of a sudden shoots right up, and then a few months later, shoots right back down. And something else happens at exactly the same time — the accidental deaths shoot up exactly when the gun sales spike up, they shoot down exactly when the gun sales spike down. We also happen to see that in the states in which those spikes were the largest, we also see accidental firearm deaths increase the most in those states. That's just too much of a coincidence., Howard: Which states were they that you saw that spike, the most pronounced?, Levine: Two of the states that had the biggest spikes were West Virginia and New Hampshire., Howard: These deaths seem to have a larger impact on children, and why is that?, Levine: Because they're the ones who might be likely to pick up the gun and play with it if they're exposed to it., Howard: Why would it be happening right after Sandy Hook more than any other time?, Levine: With the increase in gun sales that took place at that time, children may have greater exposure to the guns because the gun just came into the house, the kid happens to pick it up and then a tragic event results., Howard: After these mass shootings, are there always cries for gun controls to be put in place?, Levine: Really, the only two mass shootings in which we do see very large spikes in gun sales, are after Sandy Hook and after San Bernardino. Those are the two in which actual policy proposals were put on the table that had a reasonable chance of success. So after Sandy Hook, President Obama spoke very forcefully about the need for gun control legislation, including actually introducing legislation that ended up not being successful — those laws never got enacted. And what's interesting about it, is you see significant spikes in the number of people who search on Google for terms like ‘Where do you buy a gun?' The day the president would give those speeches, you’d see these huge spikes., You see similar evidence right after San Bernardino, after the terrorist attack that took place a couple of years later when President Obama introduced executive orders that were related to gun control. At that point, you see very large spikes in gun sales, as well. Other than that, you really do not see spikes in gun sales that occur immediately after mass shootings. For instance, after the Las Vegas shooting a couple of months ago, there was nothing there. And the reason why you don't see anything now is because nobody's really worried about gun control legislation being enacted., Howard: Sounds like a terrible unintended consequence., Levine: There's definitely issues of unintended consequences here. Certainly, the legislation that was being introduced at the time and President Obama's efforts to enact gun control legislation was done with goodwill, with an intent to reduce gun deaths. What we see in the study is actually the opposite outcome — that in this particular instance, we see accidental gun deaths rose as a result., Howard: What can be done about this? I mean people, of course, are going to be asking for something to be done about guns after there's a mass shooting. So what, are people to stay silent?, Levine: You know, I think that the right way to think about this is that to the extent that gun control legislation is going to be successful, it has to be introduced, debated and passed. What ends up happening, if it just gets introduced and discussed, but not enacted, you're just going to get the costs associated with the discussion and not the potential benefits., Howard: OK, thanks so much for coming in., Levine: Thank you for having me., Howard: That's Professor Phillip Levine. He is co-author of a study out in the journal ""Science"" that shows that the surge in gun sales after the Sandy Hook shooting caused an additional 60 accidental deaths above normal; 20 of those were kids. That happens to have been the same as the number of children who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School five years ago today., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

57,[A Changing Boston City Council Ends Year With Tears And Cautionary Note For Mayor],"[It would be easy enough to write off Wednesday’s hours-long end-of-year Boston City Council session, of which a great portion included Council members praising each other’s work and celebrating departing Council members, as a pat political routine, a self-serving sideshow., But it would be bad reporting., Over the course of nearly four hours, Council members passed significant legislation pushing the city administration into requirements Mayor Marty Walsh has not proposed himself, bucked the mayor on recent school policies, and collectively cheered what seems to be an increasingly ambitious collective vision for the city’s legislative body., In terms of hard legislation, the session included the passage of a bill that will encode reforms to city contracting that the administration of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has supported in theory for years – but without much administrative action., Nearly two years ago, Walsh signed an executive order aimed at better practices for including more minority and women-owned businesses in the often-lucrative city contracts that have historically been a mainstay of political patronage. But that order didn’t establish significant new policies; the bill passed by Council on Wednesday, championed by Council President Michelle Wu and Councilor Ayanna Pressley, requires city departments to actively solicit under-served communities for contracting opportunities and provide regular reports on the progress thereof.   , Meanwhile, several Council members interrupted their own end-of-year ceremony to introduce last-minute motions calling on the Boston Schools Committee to reconsider or hold off on a recent decision to implement new start and stop times for Boston Public Schools students – a plan supported by Walsh., In their remarks during Council, members Annissa Essaibi-George and Matt O’Malley were most vocal in their criticism of the BPS plan for school start and end times, saying in so many words each that while the motives behind the plan were good, the schools committee had gotten the final product wrong., City Councilor Andrea Campbell, who represents parts of Dorchester and Mattapan and will take Wu’s place as Council president when the body reconvenes in January – was less antagonistic to the plan, noting that the changes seemed to benefit many of her constituents but also suggesting that the Schools Committee could have done better in the area of “communication.”, Councilor Tito Jackson, who gave up his seat next year to launch an ultimately unsuccessful mayoral campaign against Walsh, introduced his own proposal for a resolution-by-vote that day, saying that the alternate motion by his peers, which called for a hearing next January, would be too late., Walsh, just minutes after he had honored departing Council members, played down objections, saying the Council had known for “months” of the plan.  , Shortly after Walsh’s comments, at least two Council members took to Twitter to say that wasn’t the case., But even outside of the political kerfuffles, the closing Council session seemed to resonate with notes of change in the wind., There were the remarks of outgoing City Councilor Sal LaMattina who, frequently choking up as he spoke, noted the changing demographics of his native East Boston and the connection he felt, as the grandson of Italian immigrants and growing up in tough circumstances., Recalling a chance to speak to graduates of East Boston High School, he said: “I really wanted to talk to the students – especially the Latino students, because I know a lot of them are nervous, and concerned with a lot of the rhetoric that is going on in Washington. And I wanted to tell them my story – growing up in East Boston,  a single mother on welfare, four boys, in four rooms.”, “If you work hard in our city, there are opportunities for you,” LaMattina said. “I was the first one in my Italian immigrant family to go to college, the first one.”, Among the Council members who rose to reciprocate LaMattina’s heartfelt speech was Council President-Elect Andrea Campbell. A young African-American councilor poised to lead the Council as the second woman of color ever to have the job after current Council president Michelle Wu -- Campbell seemed to choke up herself addressing the older, outgoing Italian-American LaMattina, saying he had been a major support., It was, perhaps, one more sign that the Boston City Council is an institution that, like many things, is changing rapidly. When it reconvenes next year, it will consist of more women and women of color than ever before.  , City Councilor Tito Jackson, meanwhile, who gave up his seat to run against Walsh for mayor, had much to say -- including a pointed message to his soon-to-be-former colleagues:  , “You’re going to read in the paper every single day that this body is a weak City Council, a weak body, we can’t do anything, we don’t make a difference – I absolutely disagree,” Jackson said., Calling on Council members to push for more funding for Boston schools, Jackson added:, “Seven members of this body,” – a majority of Council – “can block any budget. The question is, are we going to use the most important bone in our body … our backbone.”, Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

59,[What's Next For The Boston Herald?],"[Barbara Howard: The Boston Herald is being sold. The Herald announced that it had declared bankruptcy last week. It looks as though GateHouse Media will be coming on as the owner. That is the newspaper group that owns hundreds of papers across the country including dozens right here in Massachusetts. It's already made it clear that it will be cutting staff. And so, what will these changes that the Herald mean for the Boston media landscape? With us in the studio to talk about that is Northeastern University journalism professor and WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy. Thanks for coming in, Dan., Dan Kennedy: Thanks, Barbara., Howard: So give me a quick little history, and what is the influence of GateHouse Media right now in this area?, Kennedy: Well GateHouse owns more than 100 papers in eastern Massachusetts — just about every community weekly you can think of is a GateHouse paper, but also some of the medium-sized dailies like the MetroWest Daily News, the Brockton Enterprise. Buying a No. 2 daily paper in an urban market does not really fit with what they've done in the past. So this is a little different, and it's hard to know what they've got in mind., Howard: What do you think they have in mind?, Kennedy: Well you know, I really don't know. But what I did this week for WGBHnews.org, is I actually updated a column that I wrote for the Boston Phoenix 12 years ago on some ideas that might make the Herald a better and more interesting paper., Howard: Like what?, Kennedy: I think that what stood out to me from what I wrote 12 years ago that still makes sense, is maybe turn the Herald into a free daily paper. There's still advertising value in print. It's actually gotten difficult to find places to buy newspapers. But if you were handing them out, it would be a better quality alternative to the Metro, they could get some advertising in front of people, and I think it might go pretty well., Howard: Why do you think it's come to this — that they've declared bankruptcy and the sale is on?, Kennedy: Well you know, Boston is one of the very few cities left that still had two competitive daily papers. I guess the real question is why it took this long. And I think the answer to that is that starting in the early 80s, Rupert Murdoch, and then later, his protégé Pat Purcell, who bought the paper from him in 1994, were just very, very determined to keep the Herald alive. And they have continued in recent years with a very small staff. It was small enough that up until a couple of years ago, according to Purcell, the paper was making money. Unfortunately, it's no longer making money. And although GateHouse is very good at cutting, the fact is, if Pat Purcell had kept it, he would have had to cut it, too., Howard: What's it mean for the Globe? I mean, it becomes a one paper town, pretty much, if they keep cutting this paper. And it becomes almost irrelevant if it's cut too much., Kennedy: Here's where I'm going to be optimistic. The Herald is going from 240 employees to about 175 employees, according to Purcell's announcement to the staff. About half of them are newsroom employees. That would still give the Herald one of the bigger newsrooms in Boston, and I would like to think that if the resources are deployed smartly, it would be able to continue to do some good work. The media landscape has changed a lot. It has long since ceased to be a two daily newspaper battle every day. There are multiple No. 2s now, including WGBH and WBUR. There are many No. 2s, so I think we have to get beyond that kind of thinking., Howard: Where can the Herald distinguish itself — where [are] the weaknesses in the other media around here?, Kennedy: You know, one thing I think the Herald could do that it has never really done: be a really smart conservative alternative to everything else. The fact is, the Herald is not particularly smart, and frankly, despite a few columnists like Howie Carr and Adriana Cohen, it's not particularly conservative, either. It's just kind of muddling along with decent local news coverage. I would really kind of double down on trying to appeal to a younger audience that may not be as liberal — especially on economic issues — as the Globe thinks they are, and really provide a real alternative., Howard: OK, thanks so much, Dan., Kennedy: Thank you, Barbara., Howard: That's WGBH News contributor and Northeastern University Journalism Professor Dan Kennedy., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

64,[Boston's Poor Forced To Find 2017 Apartments At 2005 Rental Rates],"[We’ve all heard about rising rents in Boston. According to Zillow, the average two-bedroom apartment in the city goes for $2,300. Imagine someone helped you to rent an apartment, but they said you can only rent a place that costs what an apartment did in 2005., “With no rent control, it is extremely hard,” said 35-year-old Ashesha Rockette., Rockette receives a state housing voucher that helps subsidize her rent. She is required to pay a third of her monthly income — $211 — toward the rent while the state kicks in the rest. Two years ago, that meant the state was paying the difference between her third and a cap of $1,392 — the maximum amount she could spend on rent. Rockette was not able to find an apartment at that rate. She eventually negotiated a better deal with the state, but many people who rely on these vouchers are still locked into the cap, which was set back in 2005. , “It’s not fair,” Rockette says.  “I work hard. Why should I have to move out of this city? The city is all I know.”, , Rockette said finding a two-bedroom apartment for less than $1,400 was impossible., More than a thousand Boston families depend on the Massachusetts Rental Voucher Program to rent homes. The program was once a model for helping low-income families choose their own housing, but after deep funding cuts, the vouchers are frozen in time.     , The vouchers are “almost worthless at this point,” said Emilee Gaebler, an attorney representing tenants at Greater Boston Legal Services., “If you need to stay within a certain community or near your family or medical providers, you can’t find a housing unit that’s within the rent range that you need it to be,” Gaebler said., That’s how Rockette felt when she was searching for an apartment. She and her son couch-surfed at friends’ homes. Rockette had some rough years, including run-ins with the law almost a decade ago, but she believes it was the spending limit that kept her from getting an apartment. She pleaded with the nonprofit that administers her voucher, Metro Housing Boston, for additional funds., “Rent had went up,” Rockette said. “So I had to fight with Metropolitan Housing to give me more money on my voucher so I could have somewhere to stay,” she added, referring to the organization by its old name., She said Metro Housing Boston bumped up her subsidy by $250 so she could find an apartment that costs up to $1,650. Rockette’s not the only one to get her subsidy increased.  , Metro Housing Boston, which administers the Massachusetts Rental Housing Voucher program in the Boston area, requests waivers or increases for more than 50 percent of recipients to make them “more usable for folks,” said executive director Chris Norris., Norris’s nonprofit doesn’t set policy for the state’s voucher program., “The programs need to accurately reflect what the market is doing,” Norris said. “And to take the steps necessary to allow families true opportunity and housing choice for where they need to live in order to maintain their safety net, their job, and school for their children.”, Credit: Metro Housing Boston, The state’s Department of Housing and Community Development would not comment on the funding levels for the voucher program. The state slashed the budget in the 1990s. Over the last few years, they’ve restored some funding, but that’s gone to increasing the number of vouchers, not the subsidy amount.  , “We’re okay with that because we think you can distribute more vouchers if you keep it at that rent level,” said State Rep. Kevin Honan, who co-chairs the Massachusetts legislature's Joint Committee on Housing., To live on that, Honan admitted, “You have to be creative. There’s no question. You have to work really hard. There’s a lot of onus on the tenant to search the region. May not be able to get it in the neighborhood in Boston that you want.”, At 2005 rates, you may also struggle to find a safe, working apartment that meets state housing standards, said Rockette., When Rockette eventually found a place in Hyde Park for $1,650, it was far from perfect. Last week, the water was turned off. There’s mold, and rodents. Her mailbox has never locked properly, so she misses important mail.  , She’s afraid to complain too much, because she doesn’t want to lose her place and face finding another below-market-rate apartment in Boston., Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly called Metro Housing Boston by its previous name, and also mischaracterized the organization, which is a nonprofit., Bianca Vázquez Toness is the Managing Editor and Correspondent for K-12 Education at WGBH Radio.

66,[The Massachusetts Stories Behind Two Of The World's Most Enduring Christmas Carols ],"[There is much about the holiday season that seems timeless, inevitable; as if it simply always was. But Santa wasn’t a guy in a red suit until the 19th century. Chocolate chip cookies weren’t invented until the 20th century. And each of those ubiquitous Christmas carols currently dominating the airwaves was once written by someone. And it turns out, two of the most popular and enduring Christmas tunes were made in Massachusetts., ""THE LITTLE DRUMMER BOY"", Katherine K. Davis was born in Missouri, but it was as a student at Wellesley College in the 1900s that she would find her voice and begin to make her name., ""She was studying English Composition or English literature up until her sophomore year, and then in her junior year decided music was really it,"" said Claire Fontijn, chair of the music department at Wellesley College., In 1914, the year Davis graduated from Wellesley, won the school’s Billings Prize for music., ""In that day it was a very distinguished prize and she talked about it her whole life and it took her a long way,"" said Fontijn. , How far? Davis would go on to study at New England Conservatory and in Paris with legendary composer and teacher Nadia Boulanger, who worked with Aaron Copland and Philip Glass, to name a few., By the 1940s, Davis had settled in Concord, Massachusetts and was teaching and writing music., ""[One day], when she was trying to take a nap, she was obsessed with this song that came into her head and it was supposed to have been inspired by a French song, 'Patapan,'"" explained Fontijn. ""And then ‘patapan’ translated in her mind to 'pa-rum-pum-pum,' and it took on a rhythm."", The result was ‘Carol of the Drum’, a tune sung for years by amateur choirs before it was first professionally recorded in the early 1950s by the Trapp Family Singers — yes, the Sound of Music family — who had moved to New England during World War II.  , But it was a 1958 recording by the Harry Simeone Chorale, who retitled it The Little Drummer Boy, that launched Davis’ song up the charts, and into the Christmas music canon., Over the past six decades, ""The Little Drummer Boy"" has been recorded by more than 200 artists ranging from Rosemary Clooney to The Temptations, and recently, Justin Bieber featuring Busta Rhymes., Davis would go on to compose some 600-plus works before her death in 1980. In her will, she left all royalties and proceeds from her music to the Wellesley College music department. Today, Fontijn says that money funds, among other things, free music lessons for non-music majors., ""They’re studying, let’s say neuroscience, this very heady thing, and they can play the piano or play the violin or sing and it gives them a real nourishment for the soul and for the body,"" she said. , ""JINGLE BELLS"", ""The Little Drummer Boy"" is a tough act to beat, but how about another familiar carol: the third most recorded Christmas song in history (about 20,000 versions), according to FiveThirtyEight, the New York Times' stats blog. It’s appeared in more films — almost 400 — than any other Christmas tune. And it wasn’t even written as a Christmas song.  , ""No, I don’t think it becomes a Christmas carol really until the beginnings of the 20th Century,"" said Medford Historical Society’s Kyna Hamill, who’s a faculty member at Boston University and something of an expert on ""Jingle Bells"" composer, James Lord Pierpont. The Boston-born Pierpont was the son of a prominent minister and uncle to J.P. Morgan., ""He wasn’t perfect,"" said Hamill. ""He abandoned his family. He’s not the best of men. He tried his hand at so many things and he struggled a lot."", For decades, ""Jingle Bell""’s origins have been disputed. A plaque in the city of Medford claims Pierpont wrote it in a tavern there in 1850. Savannah, Georgia, the city where he was living for at least a time in the 1850s, claims it was written there. The dispute has become known as the Jingle Bell Wars.  , ""Every city has a claim or a stake to some person or some event or some moment and it’s very important for the identity of the town,"" said Hamill. , Still, Hamill has spent the last few years attempting to finally get to the bottom of the story., ""Did he sit and write it in a tavern in Medford? I don't know. I stopped asking that question. Did he do it in 1850? I don’t think so,"" said Hamill. ""I’ve located him as having so many different professions and struggling for money all the time and he would not have sat on a song for seven years."", Hamill says seven years, because it was first published in September of 1857 as ""One Horse Open Sleigh."" And Hamill believes she’s found the playbill from the song’s first performance. It reveals a far more complex — even controversial — origin, as the song was featured that year in the season opening at Boston’s Ordway Hall, a theatre that specialized in blackface minstrel shows., ""Blackface minstrel music coming out of Ordway Hall in the mid-19th century was very middle-class entertainment,"" explained Hamill. ""Families were allowed, children were allowed."", But however benign this form of entertainment may have seemed to white audiences, it was always offensive and problematic for African-Americans., ""The minstrel tradition is a very difficult history to consider because it was really stealing and lampooning a culture of people,"" said Hamill., As Hamill has learned, sleigh songs like Pierpont’s were a dime a dozen in the minstrel halls., ""There’s nothing that original about it. Sleigh songs, as I’ve often said, are having a moment in the 1850s,"" she said. ""I’ve tracked about 60 sleigh ride songs from that period."", So how did ""Jingle Bells"" emerge from the pack?, ""That part of the story does elude me,"" she explained. ""Why this particular song? I mean, having said that, it is a catchy song. It is a very catchy song."", What we do know is that song found its way into popular music anthologies and parlor books and emerged as the light, jaunty holiday tune we know today. But the earliest surviving recording of the song from 1898 gives us a sense of its roots, performed as part of a sketch by The Edison Male Quartette, playing stock characters popular in the minstrel tradition.  , As for the next time you hear it on the radio, Hamill says its ok to enjoy it. Though maybe just take a moment to acknowledge the complexity of the American experience., ""I really don’t want to have people think that singing this song is a bad thing,"" she said. ""There’s a legacy to a lot of minstrel songs. Steven Foster songs, Oh Susanna. But I think popular songs like this deserve as much attention as any other rigorous historical study."", Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Katherine Davis wrote the lyrics to"" America The Beautiful,"" which were written by another Wellesley alum, Katharine Lee Bates., Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"
67,[3-D Decals May Get Drivers To Slow Down ],"[A novel tactic adopted in cities from New Delhi, India to West Vancouver, Canada aims to get drivers to slow down on streets., The three-dimensional images are intended to catch drivers off-guard and make them ease up on the pedal. The images look like a crosswalk or a child playing with a ball in the middle of the street, but they aren’t real. They are painted on the pavement, and appear to pop up as a vehicle approaches. , Outside of the United States, traffic safety groups have been trying them out, in hopes they might create safer driving. In Massachusetts, drivers like Larry Spence of Centerville are open to the idea., “This sounds like it’s good idea. It’s technology at it's best,” Spence said., Here in Boston, where speeding is an ongoing complaint and the default limit has been lowered to 25 mph, city transportation officials have signaled they may be interested in trying a tactic like these images, known as decals. But Carlo Ratti, a professor of urban technologies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says this concept is not a sure bet., “I think it’s interesting. I think certainly, today, it can help to make our roads safer. [It] certainly depends on how people will respond to them,” Ratti said., Mary Maguire, a spokeswoman for AAA Northeast, expressed concern that the images could actually cause traffic hazards., “If suddenly you’re driving along and an image of a little girl with a ball pops up, it could cause a driver to slam on his breaks. That could cause a crash,” Maguire said., While the image of the little girl raised that question, AAA driving instructor Todd Pluta pointed out that this kind of illusion isn’t far off from those he already uses in his classroom., “We have some videos that show children coming out with a ball or running out between parked cars and things like that, so those are things that we teach them already.” Pluta added. “The one that I really liked was the crosswalk that seemed to be a foot tall going across the road. That would really stand out.”, In the U.S., the optical illusions would violate highway standards, but federal officials have the power to grant permission to test the markings. Officials could also ultimately approve them., Maguire says she wants to see more studies done on the decals., “It’s not a proven technology. It’s a new technology, and there’s not a lot of data to support that it’s an effective technology, which is really the key thing,” Maguire said., Ratti suggested looking to other kinds of technology to make our roads safer. “If you look at the future just a few years from now, think about self-driving cars, you can do all of that just using digital information,” he said., Boston's Transportation Department would like to know more about the 3-D illusions, according to the office of commissioner Gina Fiandaca.

Students will have to offer documentation of their displacement and meet the transfer requirements for the public schools' spring semester., The news came as Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselló met with Gov. Charlie Baker and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to discuss the influx of Puerto Ricans coming to Massachusetts and how the state's institutions can help rebuild the island., ""Education is the No. 1 concern of parents who are leaving Puerto Rico. So allowing that fair treatment, showing that empathy to the students who are moving here and the families is of tremendous help to our people,"" Rosselló said., Rosselló said there will be a time when his territory calls back upon those who have left, but called the tuition offer a great blessing., During a press conference with Baker and Walsh, Rosselló said Puerto Ricans are asking for equal treatment as American citizens to the federal disaster relief efforts that have aided Texas, Florida and other states after similar storms., ""If we get that, I am sure we will be on a path to rebuild a stronger, more resilient Puerto Rico. And I know that is important to the constituents to the governor and the mayor because there are a lot of our Puerto Rican brothers and sisters over here,"" Rosselló said., The governors and mayor also discussed ways to help the influx of Puerto Ricans who fled to the Boston area since the hurricane., Mike Deehan is WGBH News' State House reporter.]"

The U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment on the new indictment., Specifically, prosecutors removed wording alleging that the defendants illegally sought the hiring of union labor that was ""unnecessary"" or ""superfluous."" , The changes might have seemed small, but the defendants argued that they amounted to a substantial enough change to the charges against them that they were entitled to have time for more discovery and to change a motion to dismiss the case before trial., U.S. District Judge Leo T. Sorokin agreed, moving the trial date to March 26 and giving the defendants until a week from now to file a revised motion to dismiss., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

Charlie Baker and the woman behind it. , State Auditor Suzanne Bump released a report last week that found 260 cases of serious injuries that were documented by Mass Health were not documented by DCF over a two-year period. Additionally, 16 incidents deemed “critical” by the Office of the Child Advocate, which DCF was aware of, were not reported, including stabbing, rape and attempted suicide; and 19 cases of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and/or neglect documented by DCF were not reported to District Attorneys., Shortly after the audit was released, Baker pointed to his administration’s recent efforts to reform the agency — including a $100 million budget increase, the hiring of 300 more case workers and nearly 100 more managers. This morning, he followed up on his response with a letter sent to all DCF staff, which reads, in part:, ""I was dismayed to see the Auditor put out an audit that relied on data that was 2-3 years old and talk about it like it happened yesterday – especially when everyone knows so much has changed at DCF since the fall of 2015 …. [F]or this report to ignore nearly everything you have done for the past two and a half years to improve the agency’s ability to do its work strikes me as wrong., “I don’t regard this audit as an indictment of the agency,” Mass. Auditor Suzanne Bump said when she joined Greater Boston to discuss her findings. “Clearly, the Secretary of Human Services and the commissioner at DCF are making heroic efforts to turn that agency around. What I am pointing out is that these are areas that they haven’t addressed. This audit looks at matters completely apart from the areas of change that they have indeed undertaken. This is not taking away from the reforms that they did, but we didn’t audit those reforms.”, Bump added that whether the information was ""two days old, two weeks old or two months old,"" it’s information that DCF needs to have to protect children. , ""While, in fact, the administration is correct that these were incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2015, the reason that we’re concerned this problem persists is that DCF still does not make use of the MassHealth database,"" she said. ""I understand [Gov. Baker] wants to boost the morale of his staff.

81,[What Elizabeth Bishop's Poem 'The Fish' Has To Say About The Shrinking Of Bears Ears National Monument],"[Earlier this month, in the largest reversal of national monument protections in modern history, President Donald Trump announced he would reduce the size of the Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante in Utah by as much as 85 percent., Richard Blanco, the nation's fifth presidential inaugural poet and author of the memoir ""The Prince Of Los Cocuyos,"" says the move should make us think critically about mankind's relationship with nature. In his latest installment of ""Village Voice,"" Boston Public Radio's recurring conversation about how poetry can help us understand the news of the day, Blanco discussed these themes as they appear in the poem ""The Fish"" by Elizabeth Bishop. , ""Bishop's work teaches us or evokes for us a sense of reverence and awe in nature I think is parallel to how we should be treating these monuments,"" Blanco said., In the poem, the narrator catches a big, sturdy fish, remarking that ""he hadn't fought at all."" But then she notices five other fish hooks embedded around its mouth, evidence of his past efforts to stay alive., ""This would be the sixth time, and he's finally given up,"" Blanco explains. ""He's battered, he's a veteran, he's survived five battles against man, so to speak...That's why he hadn't fought. That's part of what makes this poem so interesting — it's not your expected fishing poem."", Then, in a twist, the narrator lets the fish go. Blanco says this turn shows the narrator considering her relationship with the natural world., ""If we think about Bears Ears...this place has been here forever, right? And we're trying to own it. We're trying to catch it, we're trying to control it. Analogous to the fish, we're trying to take over it,"" Blanco said., ""I think part of what Elizabeth Bishop realizes is that this fish does not belong to her — that it has earned its place in this world, and it's part of the natural world that she belongs to as well,"" he continued., Click the audio player above to hear more from poet Richard Blanco., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

The court is modeled after one for homeless veterans created in San Diego in 1989., With the sound of “hear ye, hear ye,” court opened one session earlier this year, as it always does. Attorneys and their clients stood in front of Judge Kathleen Coffey in her long black robe. A  bailiff sat at attention. An American flag was displayed in one corner of the room., The unusual judicial setting was created specifically for people like James Vivada., “I’ve been homeless off and on since I was 14. My dad worked a lot. I ended up — due to all the chaos and everything like that — going back home, back to the shelter, back home, stay at somebody else's house,” Vivada, now 25, said.  , Vivada appeared in the homeless court in response to a warrant for malicious destruction of property., “I’m trying to get to the point where I can get back on my feet,"" he said. Due to homelessness and not being able to afford housing, he says he had been struggling to overcome drug addiction. , The court handles misdemeanor offenses, nonviolent felonies and outstanding warrants. Anyone who is homeless or at risk of becoming homeless can appear there., Coffey has been presiding over the court for seven years., “Initially, our jurisdiction was limited to just cases involving individuals in the city of Boston, but based upon the success of the program, we have been allowed to expand the program,” Coffey said., Now, Coffey says, anyone who is homeless and dealing with an open case anywhere in the state is eligible to come before her court., Why do they need a special court?, “Homeless people ... feel alienated and not wanted,"" she said, ""and there’s that whole element of fear and distrust of the system, and also shame in their appearance.”, , Coffey has heard more than 250 cases at the Pine Street Inn and dismissed hundreds of low-level felonies, like assault and battery. Those rulings have helped people to clear their records and become eligible for housing., “It’s a barrier. Default warrants are a barrier for individuals to integrate back into society and to obtain a place to live and to obtain employment and a driver’s license,"" Coffey said. ""There are many government benefits that are not available to individuals who have open default warrants.”, With a clear record, many who have appeared before her have been able to find a place to live. Coffey, who has been a judge for 20 years, calls that a major win in the battle against homelessness., “Every time I come, I always say there but for the grace of God, there but for the grace of God go all of us,"" Coffey said. ""To see so many people here who get up every day and notwithstanding the obstacles and barriers, they struggle on. That’s why we call Homeless Court the court of second chances.”, On this day, Vivada got a second chance., “The judge says she was going to dismiss the warrant. She just has to talk to make a few phone calls,” he said., That represented a huge sign of hope for Vivada on what has been a very long journey., “I got a second chance, and I’m just going to take it and run with it,"" Vivada said.

87,"[If Net Neutrality Is Repealed, What Will It Mean For People Who Don't Have Broadband Yet?]","[The mayors of seven Massachusetts cities were among nearly 60 local leaders who sent a letter on Thursday to the Federal Communications Commission, asking the FCC not to undo Obama-era internet regulations., And while much of the discussion around the dismantling of the so-called net neutrality rules has focused on the possibility of internet providers charging for faster delivery of websites or blocking content, the issue is also raising questions about how the change might affect cities and towns that are trying to ensure high-speed access for all their residents., Tim Newman is a filmmaker who lives in the small town of New Marlborough, in the southwestern corner of Massachusetts., “I got interested in broadband many years ago, because I was very frustrated I couldn’t upload files,” he said., Newman said no company wanted to install the wires for high-speed internet. There just weren’t enough people in the town to make it profitable. So he founded an organization called Wired West, which is devoted to finally getting broadband coverage to about 20 towns in western Massachusetts., He’s still trying to get it in New Marlborough. And there’s a few ways it could happen., “One option is for us to build a network that the town would then own,"" he said. ""And that means we can control everything including the pricing.” But the downside is the town would have to pay two thirds of the cost – more than $3 million. The state would pay the rest. That plan would require a local tax hike that’s not too popular., “The other option is that if there is a private sector provider, a cable company like Comcast or Charter, that would be willing to wire our towns, there would be no cost,” Newman said., , But they’d lose control, including how much users would be charged for the service. It’s a dilemma. And now it’s getting more complicated with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s proposal to dismantle the so-called net neutrality regulations that govern what the internet providers can do., If New Marlborough were to choose to work with a broadband company, rather than building their own network, Newman is worried about what the proposed changes in FCC regulations could mean., “From everything that I have heard and read about the changes in the net neutrality rules,"" he said, ""the ultimate impact is going to be it puts more power in the hands of the various providers, and that it’s going to result in higher fees for service.” , Right now, cities and towns have a little bit of leverage when talking to cable companies about installing fiber networks, according to Harvard law professor Susan Crawford., ""Through saying, 'Look, come and build this network for us. But you can only build it by providing equal service to everybody in town and at a low price,' that's how that particular direction is being carried out in Massachusetts,” Crawford said. But she said towns may not be able to do that anymore. “The great uncertainty created by the recent FCC order is that Mr. Pai has said that any language coming out of a city or a state that's inconsistent with what I'm up to is hereby blocked by this order.”, Crawford also said that if a town required a company to build a network that reaches all its residents, it could be violating the new FCC rule., Professor Daniel Lyons of Boston College doesn’t agree.  “I don’t think there’s a direct impact on municipalities,” Lyons said, adding that towns that want to build their own networks still could., , Lyons is a self-described net-neutrality skeptic. He said the Obama-era rules are unnecessary and are stifling innovation., But Lyons does – sort of – agree with Crawford on one point about the proposal. “It will put limits on municipalities ability to go and tell the Comcasts and the Verizons of the world what they have to offer and at what price,"" he said. ""But it's not clear to me that they have that authority now.”, And he said the rules have to be consistent. “The FCC is repealing net neutrality, and it's telling state and local governments, 'you can't go create net neutrality for Massachusetts or net neutrality for the town of Concord or whatever.'”, Thursday, the mayors of Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Leverett, New Bedford, Northampton, and Springfield were among 58 local leaders who sent a letter to the FCC, opposing the proposal. They stressed the impact in areas where there’s just a single service provider, saying there’s nothing they could do to stop that company from blocking or slowing service, or from making it too expensive for low-income families., In Boston, chief information officer Jascha Franklin-Hodge said the city’s been trying to establish some competition. When Verizon finishes installing Fios service, he said every resident will have at least two choices for internet access. Even so, right now 20 percent of homes in Boston — most of them low-income — don’t have any high-speed connection., ""So anything that threatens to raise the price of Internet access worries us, because that's going to make it less affordable and less accessible for the lowest income consumers in Boston,"" Franklin-Hodge said. ""And that means that they're likely to fall further behind if they don't have access to this important resource."", The FCC is scheduled to vote on the net neutrality proposal next Thursday., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

90,[Local Haitian Families Face Looming TPS Deadline And Gut-Wrenching Decision],"[For many in Brockton’s thriving Haitian community, the place to find a taste of home is Jeano’s restaurant. Dieulifaite Jean — Jeano as he’s called — and his wife Berlange have been serving specialties from their native country for 31 years., “When I left, Haiti wasn’t perfect, but it was okay. Both my parents were working. It wasn’t like now,” said Berlange Jean., Widespread hunger, added her husband, was not common, as it is today., The plight of their native country is the one thing that pulls Berlange Jean away from the restaurant. She makes frequent trips to Haiti, where the couple runs an orphanage. Almost eight years after the earthquake, they say, in Haiti, it’s still about basic survival., , “Sometimes we carry clothes here, box them up, send them over there,” said Jeano. “Shoes, paper goods, everything we know they need."", In Brockton, home to one of the state’s largest Haitian populations, fear of being sent back to Haiti is widespread. After the earthquake, tens of thousands of Haitians were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS). However, the Trump Administration recently ruled to expire that program in 18 months. When the program ends, Haitians living in the U.S. under TPS will have to leave. That includes an estimated 5,000 Haitians in Massachusetts., “Every morning when I go to school, we say [the] pledge of allegiance, before games, we say [the] pledge of allegiance. I feel like an American citizen,” said a 16-year-old Brockton High junior., The student and his mother asked WGBH News to conceal their identities because they’re here under TPS and worry about attracting the attention of immigration officials. They came to Massachusetts shortly after the 2010 earthquake. The 16-year-old remembers sleeping in the streets because their home was destroyed.  , “Think about going back is crazy, especially the situation with my little brother,” he said. “You don’t know what’s going to happen to him.”, , His youngest brother, now in third grade, was born in the U.S. He’s the only U.S. citizen in the family., “It’s tough,” said the boys’ mother. “It’s very hard. When you try to explain to him what’s happened, he’s always crying.”, The mother said she wants to keep her family together, but must also consider if her only U.S.-born son would be better off staying in this country rather than in Haiti., It’s a common predicament. The Center for American Progress estimates more than half of the country’s 50,000 Haitians holding TPS have a U.S.-born child. Most TPS families are working, nearly a quarter have a mortgage, and more than a third hold a college degree, according to the Center for Migration studies., “Forcing you to leave, it’s not easy,” said Dieulifaite Jean. He gestured toward the heavens, saying only God knows what will happen to Haitians here under TPS., There is another power that could help: Congress. Democrats have drafted legislation that would enable TPS holders from Haiti and other countries to remain in the U.S. Given the climate around immigration, it's unclear if there's enough Republican support to turn those proposals into law., Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"
91,[Cape Wind Calls It Quits],"[Barbara Howard: What happened to Cape Wind? That's the project to put a wind farm off the coast of Cape Cod in the waters of Nantucket Sound. It was pioneering when it was first proposed 16 years ago. It seemed destined to become the nation's first offshore wind farm, poised to help power Cape Cod and the islands. But from the start it faced stiff opposition, not least from the Kennedy family. This fall, the project finally appeared to be back on track. But now, the plug has been pulled once and for all. Cape Wind's president is Jim Gordon and he's on the line to tell us what happened. Hello, Jim., Jim Gordon: Hi, Barbara., Howard: So back in September, the Interior Department did reaffirm Cape Wind's lease of 46 square miles on Nantucket Sound and then recently, the project's opponents filed a Notice of Appeal, and then shortly after that, the project was scrapped. So why was the plug pulled?, Gordon: Over the years, there was just opposition from a very small special interest group that filed over 25 appeals on the project over its life., Howard: It sounds like the court costs were going to kill this?, Gordon: Look — it's not so much the court costs. What's worse is the time element, and part of it is the process itself, how it lends itself to just endless appeals like there's no finality. I mean, I can't tell you how many times we re-litigated the same things in different forms. But it's really the time — time can kill a project., Howard: So Cape Wind did have a lot of critics in high places — the late Sen. Ted Kennedy was among them. Now Kennedy and others in his camp said that they did have environmental concerns, but some felt that it was really a matter of their view of the ocean off the coast of Cape Cod being blighted by more than 100 wind turbines that would have been visible from the shore. There also were worries about harm to property values. Here is another Kennedy — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — raising environmental concerns back in 2005., SOUND FROM ROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., You wouldn't put a wind farm in Yosemite. You shouldn't put one in Yellowstone. You shouldn't put one on the Boston Commons and you shouldn't put one in Nantucket Sound. This is, you know, the worst trap that environmentalists can fall into., Howard: What do you say to that?, Gordon: What I say to Mr. Kennedy is that the project went through 17 federal and state agencies. The Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act office said that Cape Wind would contribute [to] and enhance the environment and preservation of Cape Cod and the islands. The waters there are warming, lobsters are migrating, the lobster industry is decimated. There are a number of environmental harms that are being visited on Cape Cod because of climate change. This project went through probably the most comprehensive permitting process in the history of Massachusetts. And, we looked at numerous sites, alternative sites, as part of the process, and the federal agencies concurred that Horseshoe Shoal was the best spot for this project. And yes, there was some opposition, but you have to understand we had an enormous amount of support from environmental advocates like Mass. Audubon, Conservation Law Foundation, National Resource Defense Council. All kinds of people wanted this project to happen. Unfortunately, that was stopped by a small group of people that just had unlimited resources to continue to gum up the works in the courts. That's what ultimately led to our decision, because there were still many avenues that the opponents could have appealed the project on., Howard: What is your sense of the future of offshore wind in the United States?, Gordon: You know, we were the lone voice in the wilderness many years ago when we started this project. But now, people are recognizing that offshore wind is going to be an important part of the energy future, and we're proud of the role that we played., Howard: Do you have any regrets?, Gordon: I have no regrets at all. Although Cape Wind didn't come to fruition, we're proud of the catalyzing and pioneering effort we devoted to bringing offshore wind to the United States., Howard: OK, thank you so much, Mr. Gordon., Gordon: OK, Barbara., Howard: That's Jim Gordon. He was president of Cape Wind, which had been trying to build an offshore wind farm in the waters of Nantucket Sound, but after 16 years, it's now ended that effort. WGBH News did reach out to one of Cape Wind's chief opponents, the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound. They declined to comment., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

	Earlier this week, the Supreme Court temporarily reinstated the third version of Donald Trump’s travel ban.

He begins with P.T. Barnum and an early claim to fame, showing the nursemaid of George Washington in 1835, who would have been 161 years old., “What it provided for people, I think, is a way to access this past, to touch the person who literally nursed George Washington, and really connect us as a young nation to our past.” he said. “I think very much the hoax does some of the same things today; it often imagines a past, and the difference to me is now the past isn’t imagined as some great, glorious thing, but often as this tragic place.”, Joyce Heff, the alleged nursemaid, was black, but Young says race played a role in many more of the hoax examples he found in his research. In fact, it started to present itself as a common thread., “You start to see the way that race is intertwined with the hoax, and not only are hoaxes dependent on race and deep divisions in our culture, but also race itself can be thought of as a kind of hoax, as a fake thing pretending to be real,” said Young., Young says he began to hypothesize that hoaxes seemed to be increasing in number, amount, duration and effect over time as he conducted his research., “They were talking about horrific things more horribly, if you will, and so I really set out to write this book to understand, is that [hypothesis] indeed true?” he said. “And I came to understand that it was.”, Kevin Young will be at the Harvard bookstore tonight at 7 p.m. His new book is ""Bunked: The Rise of Hoaxes, Humbug, Plagiarists, Phonies, Post-Facts, and Fake News."" He’s director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the New York Public Library and the Poetry Editor at the New Yorker.

There have been some takeovers, and frankly, those takeovers have had mixed results.”, Reville told WGBH News that if he were education secretary again, he would remove power from local authorities.“Time after time, local authorities haven’t been able to solve the problem,” Reville said. “Then you ... appoint a state-appointed receiver to go in and take on a chronically failing school.”, Last December, school officials placed Shawn Shackelford on leave for undisclosed reasons. Shackelford was never formally replaced., “There were a lot of very basic administrative i’s that weren’t dotted and t’s that weren’t crossed,” Reville said. “From that ranging to corruption, ranging to people who haven’t been licensed going into the position, again, it’s been a comedy of errors with tragic consequences for kids.”, Paul Reville is the former Secretary of Education and a professor at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education where he also runs the Education Redesign Lab.

There is an exception to the elimination of those deductions: a property tax deduction capped at $10,000., All but one of the House Republicans that voted against the tax overhaul were from one of three high-tax states that would be negatively affected by the bill: New York, New Jersey and California., Neal said the issue of state and local tax deductions will be discussed in the conference, and if that elimination is scrapped, the tax revenue will have to come from elsewhere., “The outcome of that means that you need more money from other parts of the tax cut to pay for it,” he said., Neal also took issue with the idea that economic growth spurred by tax cuts in the bill would pay for the nearly $1.5 trillion addition to the deficit., “That is nonsense,” he said. “I don’t think that squares with any economic reality.”, Neal said the bill that passed the Senate was held together “with bubblegum” and that debate in the conference might prolong the bill’s time on Capitol Hill., “Look at it this way,” he said, “the entire revenue architecture of the United States has been altered in three weeks.”, To hear the interview in its entirety, click on the audio player above., Molly Boigon is a former associate producer and reporter for Learning Curve, WGBH’s K-12 education desk.

105,"[Inside Boston City Hall's Rolling, Roving Office ]","[Dorchester resident Peter Gaffney recently got a new vehicle, and among the items on his to-do list was a trip to Boston City Hall to for a resident parking permit. I caught up with him on the street after he'd completed his transaction and we had the following exchange., Me: Looks like you just pulled in, threw your blinkers on, five minutes in and out. Gaffney: Less than five minutes. These girls are terrific. It worked out awesome!, If you’ve ever had to do business at City Hall, Gaffney’s experience — and his enthusiasm — might sound a little suspicious. Exactly where did he stash his car? Doesn't it take about five minutes just to get in and through security? Did he not have to wander the halls at all? Were there no lines?, Perhaps Gaffney was so excited because he didn’t technically go to City Hall. On this chilly fall weekday, City Hall came to him., ""City Hall To Go is a mobile city hall,"" explained Jacob Wessel, director of Boston’s City Hall To Go program. ""We are a nice bright red truck that roams around the city to make sure that people have an accessible way to deal with transactions, questions, and engagement with city government in the city of Boston."", I’ve been curious about City Hall To Go ever since I heard about this bright red, roving, rolling city office. And I decided it was high time to get the inside scoop on how it all works. So I caught up with the red truck in Upham's Corner and climbed inside where Wessel gave me the dime tour. It did not take long. , ""What we have in the truck is a copier-scanner, copies of forms and pamplets, wifi, a credit card processing machine, [and] laptops that are hooked up to city systems so we can cross reference things,"" he said., Two staffed, service windows open-up along the curbside of the well-marked truck, where residents can belly up to do business with the city. Now, if it sounds a little bit like a food truck, well, there's a reason for that. , ""Some folks in the mayor’s office thought up this program just about the time when the city started doing food truck permitting,"" said Wessel. ""They thought, what if we took the idea of food trucks and did the same thing with city government?"", , It started off as a pilot program in an old bomb squad truck that was destined for the scrap yard. Five years later they are a nimble team of three, out in the neighborhoods five days a week — Tuesdays through Saturdays — servicing some 300 to 400 residents each month., ""We’ve been everywhere from Hyde Park to Charlestown, from Brighton to East Boston,"" said Wessel. ""We try to get to every neighborhood about twice a month."", They stop in two different neighborhoods each day. Residents can keep an eye on the schedule on the city's website or the program's Twitter feed. Resident parking permits, like the one Gaffney got the ball rolling on, are a popular service at the truck window. Another is what brought Jamaica Plain’s Tanya Jendreck out — disputing a parking ticket, which is something she could also have done online. , ""I just think face to face is easier,"" she told me. ""And just traveling and my work schedule I was like, man, it would be really convenient if I didn’t have to go down to City Hall. So I was like, yes!"", In all, there are some 50 services Boston residents can take care of on the spot from registering to vote to paying excise taxes., ""I’d say that some of the best things that we do are birth certificates, so we’ve got a lot of new mothers and families coming by with their little ones, and then dog licenses,"" said Wessel., In the early years, City Hall was not on the go in the dark, snowy winter months. But in recent years, that has changed. , ""We thought we really ought to have this service when it’s especially hard to get around when it gets colder,"" said Wessel. , While the truck will go on hiatus sometime in January, the team will continue to pop-up in community centers and neighborhood branch libraries all winter. The idea is to keep the momentum going for their mission, which is a curious one for three city employees: get fewer people to visit City Hall.  , ""City Hall is a great building. There’s a lot of wonderful people that work there,"" said Wessel. ""But it really makes me cringe when someone talks about how inconvenienced they were. We want to be the happy, friendly one-stop shop where people can learn in their neighborhood about what’s going on."", And at least from what I heard from folks here on one blustery afternoon, they're nailing it., Is there something that has piqued your curiosity lately? If so, let me know about it. I'm always looking for story ideas and, here at the Curiosity Desk, we love when we can satisfy your curiosity.

107,[Local Police Encourage Addicts To Come Forward For Help ],"[It’s Steve Lesnikoski’s first day as the outreach worker at the Ipswich Police Department. How he came into this role may have seemed implausible a few years ago when he was living in San Jose, California., “I was addicted to heroin and in a pretty bad spot,” Lesnikoski said. “I was homeless, living in my car and I read an article on the website Reddit.”, The Gloucester Police Department was offering help to addicts with the promise of not arresting them., “I sold the rest of my possessions and I got on the plane with a backpack with a pair of clothes and came out to the Gloucester Police Department on June 1, 2015,"" he said.  , , Lesnikoski was the first person to enroll in Gloucester’s Angel program, the precursor to PAARI — Police Assisted Addiction Recovery Initiative. Since then, over 600 people have entered the Angel program in Gloucester. It worked for Lesnikoski. He has been sober for over two years now — a success story that motivated PAARI to hire him to help others beat addiction in police departments throughout Essex County., Ipswich police officer and lifelong resident, Aaron Woodworth, said it is a crisis that hits close to home in his close-knit seaside community., “I mean, everybody knows everybody,” said Woodworth. “A lot of people are related to everybody. So, it certainly hits everybody across the board.”, He is hopeful that having Lesnikoski at the police department every week will motivate addicts to feel comfortable coming to the station for help., “Whatever way we can get people to understand that we want to help them as a town — as a society. We can get people the assistance that they need,” Woodworth said. “But it's building that trust. It's that trust that we need to try and gain with people that we're not trying to lock them up and throw away the key.”, Ipswich is joining over 350 police departments nationwide that are offering drug treatment help. That number continues to grow. PAARI is now a partner with the White House’s Office of National Drug Control Policy and has also launched a recovery coach program with AmeriCorps., On Tuesday, police chiefs from across country descended on Boston for PAARI’s two-day summit to learn more about implementing a police-run treatment program. One of the challenges is insurance coverage, noted Michael Yankowski, police chief of Lansing Michigan. Gaining trust is another., “We’ve been stating for quite a long period of time now, about six months, that if you have an addiction problem, come to the police department and we will get you help.” Yankowksi said., But not many people have taken the department up on its offer., “We have not had a huge number,” he said. “And I think that’s part of the education process out there. Our overdoses are continuing but we are not getting the families, those individuals.”, That’s where Steve Lesnikoski thinks a personal connection really matters. He hopes his own experience with finally beating addiction will help others do the same., “I do understand the feelings of despair of hopelessness and absolute terror and fear. Waking up knowing that you're sick, 'How [am I] going to get money, will this drug kill me today­, will it not?' I know what that thought process looks like,” he said. “And just meeting somebody where they're at and coming to them from a place of non-judgment and really no stigma attached, I think is helpful. I want people to know that there's hope and that there's the possibility of living a different life.”, That possibility could start at a local police department., Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

109,[New Poll Shows Pessimism Among Millennials About Future Of United States],"[Barbara Howard: Two-thirds of young Americans are more fearful than hopeful about America's future, and less than a year before the 2018 midterm elections, likely young American voters cite preferences for Democratic control of Congress nearly 2-to-1. And those are just two of the findings of a new poll that came out today from the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government on the political stances of those aged 18 to 29. With us to talk about the poll is John Della Volpe. He is the director of polling for the Institute of Politics. Thanks for coming in, John., John Della Volpe: Thanks so much for having me, Barbara., Howard: So you polled about 2000 18-to-29 year-olds from 50 states over a 10 day period starting Oct. 31st — and you found that only 14 percent of young Americans believe that the country's generally heading in the right direction — and you asked a lot of questions. What stood out for you?, Della Volpe: What stood out to me, Barbara, is a sense that by a margin of 2-to-1, 67 percent of young Americans express more fear than hope about America's future. I remember just a couple of years ago when I would conduct focus groups and town meetings, I would ask young Americans what is the one thing that connects all of us, and I would hear opportunity. Today, I ask the same question, I hear fear and anxiety., Howard: You asked them a lot about the political climate. What were the main things that came out of your study?, Della Volpe: Well, clearly, Donald Trump is driving most of the political climate today, and since the last poll was released in the spring of 2017, we see that the president's approval rating is down seven points to 25 percent among all young Americans, but it's down by 12 percentage points among young Republicans, down to 66 percent approve., Howard: And they want Democratic control of Congress, though these young Americans. Is that right?, Della Volpe: They do. Again, on a 2-to-1 margin, when we look at the young Americans who indicate they will definitely vote, 65 percent prefer a Congress controlled by Democrats, 33 percent prefer one controlled by Republicans. Among independents, who are the swing group with this generation, we find again, two-to-one preference of Democrats over Republicans., Howard: This should all be good news for the Democratic Party., Della Volpe: It should be on paper — you're right, it should be. In fact, we have tracked increased motivation over the last four years among Democrats and over the last year. But unfortunately for the Democratic Party, only 34 percent of young Americans believe the Democratic Party cares about people like them., Howard: Now they're looking to the 2018 midterm elections, and what was your finding in terms of confidence in the voting system, in terms of Russian interference?, Della Volpe: It's about 50/50 — about 50 percent of young Americans are not convinced that we won't have more meddling in the election in 2018 by the Russians., Howard: But 50 percent are confident in the system?, Della Volpe: There are some ‘don't knows’ in there, too., Howard: OK. Well let's talk about race. Seventy nine percent of young Americans you polled are concerned about the state of race relations today — 68 percent of black Americans, 46 percent of Hispanics believe that their race is under attack, in the words that you use in the poll, ‘a lot’ in America, while 15 percent of white people feel the same way., Della Volpe: I think this is one of the most significant findings in this survey, and I want to stress the word ‘a lot’ — we typically, as when we write polls, have a four or five-point scale. And what's newsworthy about this — is 68 percent, almost seven out of 10 African-Americans, say they are under attack ‘a lot.’ The number of Hispanics has increased by 50 percent from 30 percent to 46 percent just in the last year., Howard: What about affirmative action — do young people support it or not?, Della Volpe: They do support it. We’ve seen more support generally overall for affirmative action over the last several years as well., Howard: OK. Now on campus — and comfort on campus — the majority of college students, 51 percent, agree that opportunities to hear highly controversial speakers adds value to their educational experience. But college Democrats are significantly more comfortable than Republicans in sharing their personal values., Della Volpe: That's right. We don't see a lot of daylight between Democrats or Republicans on the idea of bringing controversial speakers to campus — they're [in] general agreement about that, about half believe that's a great idea. But we do see a significant difference in the number of Democrats who feel comfortable speaking. We have 60 percent of young Democrats who are comfortable speaking on campus and in classrooms, etc., but only 25 [percent] of young Republicans feel the same way. We asked that question a couple of years ago during the primary process — we found that Trump voters were actually the least likely to feel comfortable sharing their viewpoints on college campuses., Howard: And this, again, is among 18 to 29 year-olds nationwide. And by more than a 3-to-1 margin, young Americans believe that social media platforms — Facebook, Twitter, YouTube — they have an obligation to regulate fake news, that came out of your study, as well. You also found that when it comes to single-payer health care, not surprisingly, 56 percent of young Americans support the single-payer option while 21 percent oppose. What else did you find? I understand you polled them about athletes taking a knee., Della Volpe: We did, and overall, 53 percent of this young millennial generation approve of some professional athletes taking a knee. But it's a highly divisive issue, it's essentially an 80/20 issue — 80 percent of young Democrats approve of athletes taking a knee while only 17 percent of Republicans approve — close to 80 percent of Republicans disapprove of that., Howard: And have you seen a shift in the belief in global warming?, Della Volpe: We have, over the last two-and-a-half years or so. We currently have about two-thirds of young Americans believing that global warming is man-made and mostly caused by emissions, which is a 9-point increase since the spring of 2015, when 55 percent agreed with that statement., Howard: What stood out for you in this polling?, Della Volpe: Generally speaking, a lot of people think about America as a 50/50 nation. I look at this generation as a two-thirds, one-third generation. What I mean by that is two-thirds are concerned about more fear than hope, but also, two-thirds agree with what Bill Clinton said 25, 30 years ago about the need to develop a new community spirit in America, something that can connect us all together and make the American dream come alive. And two-thirds also agree with Barack Obama, who said we are a nation of immigrants. We are and will be a nation of immigrants. It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican. Two-thirds of this generation agrees with those two principles about America and American values. And to me, that's what connects this generation, and I'm hopeful that Democrats and Republicans will spend some time, listen to this generation, and say do vote in 2018, because if they don't pay attention, I think the fear and anxiety we talked about earlier could be the fuel that lights, potentially, even a third-party move in 2020., Howard: OK, thanks so much for coming in, John., Della Volpe: Thank you for having me., Howard: That's John Della Volpe. He is the director of polling for the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. The Institute of Politics came out with that new poll today on the political stances of young people., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

117,"[Cambridge Builds For Bikes, But Not Without Bumps In The Road]","[At first glance, the stretch of Cambridge Street west of Inman Square might seem like a case study in how bikes, cars and pedestrians can peacefully coexist. In quieter, more orderly moments, cyclists head toward and away from Harvard in dedicated bike lanes, flanked by parked cars on one side and the sidewalk on the other, as drivers and walkers patiently await their passage., At other times, though, pedestrians walk directly in front of bikes, seemingly unaware of their approach — and delivery trucks edge into spaces designated for parked cars and cyclists, forcing vehicles approaching behind them to swing out toward oncoming traffic., When this occurs, the road simply seems too small for everyone attempting to use it. And that’s not the only hint that things aren’t quite as harmonious as they might initially seem., “These bicycle lanes, the way they’re designed right now, they aren’t designed well,” said Robert Skenderian, a pharmacist who owns Skenderian Apothecary., As Skenderian tells it, Cambridge rolled out the dedicated bike lanes on Cambridge Street without fully considering the potential impact on local businesses., “They reduced the 15 or 20 parking spaces in this two-block area to three,” Skenderian said., Ultimately, he notes, some additional parking spaces were created later after people complained. Even so, Skenderian says, the new bike lanes have “actually pushed my business down about 15 or 20 percent.”, Not that he’s opposed to new bike infrastructure, Skenderian hastens to add. But he says it has to be done right — and that in this case, it wasn’t., “You’ve got to spend millions of dollars,” Skenderian argued. “You’ve got to reset curbs, you've got to move [sidewalk] bump-outs, you’ve got to make more space on the street for the travel lanes, and the city doesn’t want to do that."", ""The goal here was to do it now, and do it fast. And do it cheap,” he added., , Where Skenderian sees poor urban planning, however, others see a systemic shift that’s long overdue., Nate Fillmore is a co-founder of the group Cambridge Bicycle Safety. The group launched last year, after 27-year-old Amanda Phillips was killed while cycling in Inman Square., He thinks the wisdom of the new bike lanes on Cambridge Street — and another, on Brattle Street — is indisputable., “Safety is a really serious issue on Cambridge’s streets,” Fillmore said. “Every other day, on average, according to the Cambridge Police Department, a bicyclist is hit by a car. The type of bike lanes the city’s been putting in here are of a sort that’s been proven again and again, around the world, to make a huge impact on reducing the severity or bike crashes with cars,” he said., The accident rate Fillmore cites is a bit high. According to a recent analysis by the Cambridge Police Department, there are an average of 160 car-bike crashes in the city every year., But Fillmore is confident that his views are shared by Cambridge voters. He notes that almost every winning City Council candidate in last month’s election backed Cambridge Bicycle Safety’s platform, which calls for four new miles of bike lanes every year., Concerns like Skenderian’s should be considered, Fillmore adds. But ultimately, he says, “We have an unbalanced system that’s weighted in favor of cars. So when we make changes to make things safer for other constituencies, there will be trade-offs.”, , For his part, Skenderian isn’t convinced there’s been a net gain in safety at all., “The road is already so very narrow,” Skenderian said. “And when you have large vehicles, delivery vehicles, trying to pass each other, then you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by at the same time, it creates a lot of conflicts.”, According to Cambridge Mayor Denise Simmons, the new bike lanes have also generated a fair amount of confusion — especially in the heart of Harvard Square, where bikes are now going in both directions on Brattle Street, which remains one way for cars., “We had people not understanding, should you go right or left?” Simmons said. “One of my seniors, [a] 90-plus-year-old man, gets struck in the lane because he can’t figure out which way the traffic was going.”, But Simmons also says that lately, Cambridge’s back-and-forth over bikes has become way too heated., “We need to bring our best thinking, and tamp down our passion a little bit … because when everyone’s talking loud and screaming no one’s listening,"" she said., Moving forward, Simmons says, the city has to do a better job balancing a range of competing interests — and so do Cambridge residents., , “We may never get to Kumbaya,"" she cautioned. ""Cyclists have to accommodate me as a pedestrian and a motorist. I have to, as a motorist, accommodate the cyclists, and I’m getting better. We have pedestrians that are tethered to their devices, walking the streets and not looking up. We all have to learn to be more mindful."", “It’s a huge job,” Simmons admitted. “But we’ll get there.”, Which may mean learning to coexist slowly — street by street, and lane by lane. , Click the markers on the map below for details about the types of bike lanes located along Brattle and Cambridge Streets., ,  , Adam Reilly is a reporter at WGBH-TV's Greater Boston.]"

123,[Brigham And Women's Doctors Say Radiologists Can Help Identify Domestic Abuse Early],"[Barbara Howard: Abuse at the hands of a partner occurs at a rate of one in four women, one in nine men. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A new study suggests that hospitals, and specifically radiologists at hospitals, may be the frontline defense when it comes to identifying victims even before they come forward themselves. With us to talk about those findings out of Brigham and Women's Hospital is Dr. Bharti Khurana. She's the study's principal investigator. Thanks for coming in, Dr. Khurana., Bharti Khurana: Thank you, Barbara., Howard: So what kinds of things, like for example, you see a broken nose and then as you're looking at it on your screen, what do you see?, Khurana: So this is interesting. This is how I got motivated to do the study. I remember there was a young woman who presented to the emergency department with facial fractures. We did a CT of her face and I saw a fracture involving her nose bone, and then the more I looked, I saw another fracture involving her nasal bone on the other side, which was healed. So there were two fractures, different times, and then she had a wrist fracture. So this pattern of injury in an otherwise young, healthy woman made me raise the concern for intimate partner violence with a ER physician who wasn't suspecting this initially., Howard: What you're saying is that radiologists have this unique position where they can alert the emergency room physician to the possibility of what they're seeing?, Khurana: Right. So sometimes I talk to the ER physicians and raise the concern, but then at times I get a response like, 'Oh no, this is hard to believe because the patient is [the] wife of a physician, or the patient is happily married, patient has kids and everything is fine.' I have seen, multiple times, an expression of disbelief. The ER physician may not recognize the prior history, or maybe the patient is not forthcoming. But I always say that radiological images don't lie. I'm not making my judgment based on how [the] patient looks or based on [the] patient's race and gender, and so it's very different, the way I'm looking at this work. So that's why I think radiologists can play a key role, because we are not suffering with unconscious bias as ER physicians are., Howard: Is it common for you to find these patterns of abuse in your daily work?, Khurana: I am a trauma imager, so I see a lot of imaging related to trauma, whether it's motor vehicle accidents, falls or intimate partner violence. Very often we get a history of trauma, and at times history doesn't go with the type of fracture I'm seeing. So those are the scenarios [where] I raise concerns with ER physicians., Howard: Like what? Give me an example., Khurana: So for example, in this population we were seeing fractures involving more hands and forearms and finger fractures, and these fractures are usually defensive, so when the patient is raising her hand in protecting her face. And that's why we tend to see more distilled fractures, some more involving the fingers. Somebody will give me the history, that this is because the patient fell on the floor, and our patient fell on [an] outstretched hand. But then we see the fracture, which is not going with that mechanism., Howard: So what you're saying is, when women come in and say that they fell down, what you're seeing is not consistent with the common fall?, Khurana: Yes. So a fall on an outstretched hand gives you different kinds of fractures., Howard: So it sounds as though radiologists are trained differently. They're heavily trained in identifying and reporting child abuse. Is that so with intimate partner abuse?, Khurana: We have radiology literature full of non-accidental trauma in children. But for some reason, intimate partner violence is not mentioned in the literature., Howard: Are you trying to change that, are you coming up with protocols?, Khurana: So all of us have been seeing these patients, but nothing has been done so far. So this is the first ever study. We try to assess the findings and patterns objectively, so that once we can see those patterns, hopefully the radiologist can raise the suspicion., Howard: The way you would with children, I would think., Khurana: Absolutely., Howard: And there are protocols for doing this with children?, Khurana: There are strong protocols, yes, Howard: And those protocols, you're saying, should be applied now to domestic violence?, Khurana: Yeah, this is my hope., Howard: OK, thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Khurana., Khurana: You're very welcome, Barbara. Thanks for having me., Howard: That's Dr. Bharti Khurana of Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. She was a senior investigator on a new study showing that radiologists can spot signs of domestic violence in victims before the victims themselves come forward., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

126,[Clea Simon's World Enough: A Fictional Mystery Surrounding Boston's Night Club Scene ],"[	 
	
		Boston Based author, Clea Simon, has written mystery books for years centered on cats, but for her latest book “World Enough,” she revisits her own past. The music and arts critic drew inspiration for the book from years spent in Boston’s rock club scene, telling the story of a mystery taking place in the clubs. Simon joined WGBH's Henry Santoro for Henry in the Hub to talk about about “World Enough,” blasts from the past, and mixing reality with fiction.
Henry Santoro: Like me, Clea, you lived in the clubs back in the day. What prompted you to dust off those memories and dive into “World Enough?”
Clea Simon: Well, I think I've finally had enough distance from the club scene. I mean, ""World Enough"" sort of alternates between 1986, ‘87 and 20 years later when my protagonist is looking back on those days and revisiting them, and actually revisiting a central mystery that happened in the clubs in those days. And I think that I needed that much distance, as well., 
Santoro: And connecting with some of the people that she connected with back in the early days., , 
Simon: Indeed. In fact, the book opens with a scene of her going out to see one of those old bands — like so many of us do  — and they're no longer chasing fame and fortune, they’re now married and settled down and have day jobs. But they still play, they still love the music and, you know, the fans do, too.
Santoro: With all that said, did you change the names to protect the innocent?
Simon: Yes. One of the things that keeps coming up when people ask me about “World Enough” is am I writing about their band, or who are the real bands that I'm really writing about. And I have to stress, “World Enough” is fiction. All the incidents are true or probably true, but the bands themselves are fictionalized, as are most of the clubs, although I do refer to The Rat and The Channel and Jumping Jack Flash.
Santoro: You credit Kate Mattes, who used to own Kate's Mystery Books in Cambridge, with getting you into mystery writing. And as I said at the top, this is your 23rd book of which I would say what, 20 of them are probably mysteries, right?
Simon: Actually, if you don't mind me correcting you, this is my 23rd mystery. I had three nonfiction books before I started writing mysteries.
Santoro: There we go. That's a lot of mysteries. How was it that that Kate got you into this genre that you absolutely fell in love with?
Simon: Well, I always loved mysteries and that's how I got to know Kate, because Kate had Kate's Mystery Books up in North Cambridge and I was a regular there, but I'd been a journalist for years. I'm a music critic, as you noted, thank you. And also just covering all the all the arts, and so my first three books were nonfiction and I think that writing nonfiction sort of feels like you have an excuse to write, because you're conveying information to people. So what you're writing has some inherent value besides your writing, but it was Kate who said that I should write a mystery. And by doing that, I feel like she gave me permission.
Santoro: Publishers of mysteries love series. Is there a follow-up coming to “World Enough?”
Simon: Well, you'll have to read it to see exactly what I mean. I'm not sure Tara is going to become your typical amateur detective. I do have another Boston rock noir in mind. Yes I do.
Santoro: Will there be a cat in it?
Simon: If there is a cat in it, I can promise you the cat will not be solving the mystery.
Santoro: OK. Will you name it Henry?
Simon: Henry, for you, I will. There will be a cat named Henry.
Santoro: Clea Simon is the Somerville-based author of “World Enough,” a novel set in the grungy Boston rock club world of days gone by. Clea, so great to see you. Thank you so much for coming in.
Simon: Thank you so much, Henry.

128,[UPDATED: Mayor Walsh Signs Plastic Bag Ban],"[Update: WGBH News has learned that Mayor Marty Walsh signed the plastic bag ban on Friday., -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, A day after Boston’s City Council voted unanimously to pass a partial ban on plastic bags, Mayor Marty Walsh remained non-committal as to whether he will sign the ordinance, suggesting the possibility that the ban isn’t quite a slam dunk just yet., The ordinance passed by the council bans thinner plastic bags more prone to deterioration. It also requires that shopkeepers charge a nickel for every (sturdier) plastic bag, or paper bag with handles, they hand out.  , Speaking to reporters at an annual Christmas tree lighting, Walsh said that he is still “reviewing” the proposal, which has been making its way through the council, in various forms, for about a year., “I’m reviewing the cost,” Walsh said. “People say ‘It’s only five cents on a bag,’ — yeah, but we’re nickel and diming our seniors … so I’m going to take a good review of it before I sign it."", But asked whether that meant Walsh is considering a veto, the mayor demurred:, “I didn’t say I was vetoing it, I said I’m reviewing it. Let me review it first, and after I review it if we need to look into an adjustment we’ll look into doing an adjustment.”, “Adjustment,” however — unlike ‘veto’ — is not a word defined in the City Charter., Once passed by the City Council, an ordinance can only be signed in whole or vetoed in whole – or, if the mayor takes no action, the entire ordinance becomes law automatically., The mayor can, in a veto, submit a formal list of “objections” that must be noted in the public record and which the Council may consider in drafting a new ordinance.  , But those objections impact the council’s ability to override a veto by a two-thirds vote., The fact that the bill passed the council unanimously would seem to suggest that a veto would stand no chance — but it isn’t a given., Walsh has fifteen days in which to veto — not much time, but some time in which to maneuver. Council members who have been hearing from upset constituents, meanwhile, could change their minds., And should Walsh wait long enough, a veto could be taken up by a different body of councilors., Buried deep within the city charter are various provisions whose collective upshot, in this case, means that should Walsh issue a veto on the last day he can, the veto would fall after the end of Council’s legislative calendar and be moved to next year’s docket — to be taken up by three new Council members., City Councilor President Michelle Wu said she respected that the mayor is taking time to review the ordinance., “I think this proposal has been a great example of the different roles of different parts of government,” Wu said., “It is entirely the mayor’s right and his responsibility to be thoughtful in reviewing proposals that we send up to him,” Wu said., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
129,[Can Project Veritas Force A Change In Massachusetts' Recording Laws?],"[Barbara Howard: The group Project Veritas was caught this week trying to trick the Washington Post into publishing phony sexual assault allegations against Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. It is not the first time that that group has used hidden recording devices to try to goad reporters, media executives and others into making unflattering and sometimes unprofessional comments. But in Massachusetts and in some other states, it is a crime to record conversations without consent. So Project Veritas is challenging Massachusetts law — suing the Suffolk County district attorney's office. And with us to explain that lawsuit is Northeastern University law professor and WGBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed. Hi, Daniel., Daniel Medwed: Hi, Barbara., Howard: So what does Massachusetts law say?, Medwed: Massachusetts law says that you may not intercept the oral communications of another person, a government official discharging her official duties, or a private citizen without their consent., Howard: Project Veritas says that the prohibition against recording these kinds of things ... they're saying that it's unconstitutional?, Medwed: That's right. Their argument is that the Massachusetts law is unconstitutionally overbroad, that it captures unfairly protected First Amendment speech, including the right to a free press. And that's why they've filed a federal lawsuit. This is a lawsuit saying that Massachusetts state law interferes with the federal constitutional right to a free press., Howard: What was the intention, or what is the intention of the law in Massachusetts, as it stands now?, Medwed: I think the intention is twofold. First and foremost, it's designed to protect privacy interests. Private individuals who are out on the street may be having a conversation, maybe have a reasonable expectation of privacy in that conversation. They shouldn't have to fear that their conversations are being recorded and possibly being disclosed. Second, for government officials, I think the idea is that even though they are discharging their official duties and are, of course, subject to public scrutiny, the idea that they might be surreptitiously being recorded could somehow compromise their conscience, they might become more tentative, and that might not necessarily be what we want., Howard: You know, we're a radio station, so we record people all the time, as you know, and we always inform them that we're recording. And there's a difference there. Out in the street, though, if we're covering, you know, for example a protest with hundreds of people, we just can't get permission from each one of them. But then again, they don't have any expectation of not being recorded there. But if I go and I talk to someone in a private space, I make it clear — here I am, I'm holding a microphone, clearly recording — at least that's my understanding., Medwed: That's exactly right, and it relates to the expectation of privacy. When you're out in a public protest, in a large gathering, you don't necessarily have a reasonable expectation of privacy. But if you're in a more private setting, even if you're outside in public and you're walking down the street with a friend, maybe you do have a reasonable expectation of privacy. And if a reporter were trailing you with a hot mic, then perhaps that reporter should seek consent as, of course, we would do., Howard: Well it turned out that Project Veritas — it's come out just in the past 24, 48 hours — that apparently they were crashing parties, going away parties in a public venue, in a bar or restaurant near the Washington Post, and recording. The reporters there for the going away party were unaware of that. Now that would not be allowed in Massachusetts, is that correct?, Medwed: That's right. That would be a non-consensual interception of oral communications, and that's, to some extent, what this law is designed to protect against — that type of surreptitious eavesdropping., Howard: Why do you think Project Veritas is targeting the Suffolk DA's office here in Massachusetts?, Medwed: You know, that's a great question. It's prospective. Project Veritas indicated in its complaint that it intends to quote unquote investigate activities in the Boston area. So in this lawsuit, it’s seeking what's called declaratory and injunctive relief: it wants the federal court to declare this law unconstitutional and to enjoin or stop the enforcement of this law in Suffolk County. So it's not that anything has happened yet in Boston, it's just that Project Veritas wants to do its work in Boston and it's worried about its potential exposure., Howard: A lot of states do allow those sorts of recordings, and they're legal in other states. Is it possible that Project Veritas may have a case?, Medwed: It is possible, but quite unlikely because there is a division across the country. Some states are what's called one-party states — you don't have to have consent, just the person making the recording has to know about it. Other states, like Massachusetts, are two-party states, where both the recorder and the recordee have to be aware of it. So I think it's a question of state priorities, a question of state policy, and I very much doubt that the courts will reject this law., Howard: OK, thanks so much for joining us, Daniel., Medwed: Always a pleasure, Barbara., Howard: That's Northeastern University law professor and WGBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

The School Department had the findings. I didn’t have them."", But Paul Reville, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and former state Secretary of Education, said there are some unanswered questions about who in City Hall knew about the audit, and when., ""A lot of things that have been pointed out raise serious questions about the way the schools are managing the student activities fund,"" Reville told Boston Public Radio., ""However, I think we have to hold out some skepticism here in terms of what we've heard so far and ask further questions about who knew what and when they knew it,"" he continued. ""When you look at this $1 million penalty, only $30,000 had to do with the schools. The balance of it really comes from the city, as far as I can see."", Of the $1 million total in penalties levied by the IRS against the city, $28,000 were attributed to Boston Public Schools for paying employees under-the-table out of student activity funds and other ""bad accounting practices,"" including not keeping track of reimbursements to outside vendors, WGBH News reported Tuesday. , However, $700,000 in penalties were related to the city's failure to properly deduct Medicare and other payroll taxes from the paychecks of city employees, The Boston Globe reported. The city wrote a check to the IRS on Nov. 7 — Election Day — also according to The Globe., Reville said the timing of the check suggests that knowledge of the audit went beyond the school department., ""It's clear the city knew about this a long time ago,"" he said. ""It's not just the school department and the school department didn't inform the mayor. The city knew about it a long time and, in fact, the city office has been negotiating with the IRS over the penalties, not the school department, and that negotiation was wrapped up Nov. 2."", Reville expressed concern that the Walsh Administration was unfairly leveling the blame entirely on Chang., ""I worry there could be some scapegoating going on,"" he said., Click the audio player above to hear more from Paul Reville., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

134,[Framingham's J&amp;M Diner Reopens In New Location After Devastating Fire],"[It has been a staple in the Metro west area for nearly two decades, but when the J&amp;M Diner burned down eight months ago, its future was uncertain. The diner’s new location opened Monday, bringing back a line of longtime customers., Karen Fiore greeted customers surrounded by purple walls, 1950s music and family portraits at the diner’s new location on Route 9 in Framingham. “You’re a lifer, hopefully, when you come here,” Fiore said., Dyane Sleeper could be considered one of those lifers. She's been dining here for years. , “Mom-and-pop places are where it’s at,"" Sleeper said. ""It’s still my preference, always. I like knowing how fresh the food is and what kind of care has gone into making it, and I know that that happens here every day.”, J&amp;M is a true mom-and-pop operation. Karen Fiore and her husband Dave work with their daughters Juliana, who is the “J” in the diner's name, and Mihlan, who is the “M,” and another daughter who was born after the diner opened in 1998. Karen Fiore says the business is a passion., “We love product and we have to continue our breakfast and serve it with a smile,"" she said., , That’s something Fiore wasn’t sure her family would be able to do after a fire destroyed their building in March. She remembers getting the early morning phone call., “We heard about the fire, so my husband actually got his clothes on to go to work, thinking, ‘Oh, it’s just the other half of the mall, it’ll be fine,’"" she said. ""When we got there it was freezing cold, the wind was out of control. We were shocked. We came around on Route 30, we could see the flames behind our building and we thought, 'Wow this is not just a little fire — it’s a destruction fire.'”, Fire officials say the flames started in an attic and the wind whipped it through the Old Path Village Shopping Plaza. J&amp;M Diner, along with 10 other businesses, were gone.  , But that was then, and this now. With insurance money and $23,000 in donations from a Go-Fund Me page set up by the community, the Fiore family is back in business, much to the delight of customer Dyane Sleeper., “They are dedicated and it’s really a joy to see them turn this into something even better than it was before,"" she said., The new diner has three times the space and employs about 20 people. Most are back on the job working 364 days a year, only closed for Christmas.  Karen Fiore says that will never change., “At J&amp;M Diner, you are family,"" she said., The Fiores know most of their customers by name, and have watched many of their children grow up. That family atmosphere is apparent during times like Thanksgiving, when the diner is open., Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that the diner is open for dinner on Thanksgiving.

135,[Thousands Of Convictions Tainted By Disgraced State Chemist To Be Thrown Out],"[District attorneys in Massachusetts are asking the state's highest court to dismiss thousands of drug cases that were tainted due to misconduct by drug lab chemist Sonja Farak., Farak pleaded guilty in 2014 to stealing and using drugs from the state crime lab at UMass Amherst., District attorneys continue to compile lists of defendants whose cases they’ve recommended for dismissal, but more than 6,000 cases are expected to be thrown out., “What it says about the cases is that we no longer can trust the integrity of the drug test and that therefore the convictions stand on very shaky ground,” said WGBH News legal analyst Daniel Medwed., It’s the second time in less than a year that the state's prosecutors have been forced to throw out thousands of cases due to misconduct by drug lab chemists. More than 20,000 convictions were tossed in April after another chemist, Annie Dookhan, was caught tampering with evidence and falsifying tests., “It does seem like the prosecutors have learned their lesson a little bit from Dookhan in that they responded with a little more alacrity here and were a little quicker to dismiss the cases,” said Medwed. “They only did so previously after lengthy, extensive litigation.”, ACLU staff attorney Carl Williams said even though probably all of the defendants convicted with evidence tainted by Farak have already served their sentences, throwing out the convictions will help them get on with their lives., , ""It can affect their driver's license, it can affect the ability to get a student loan,” Williams said. “It can affect the ability to have public assistance, get any job, to get a law license, to be accepted to a school.”, Attorneys for the ACLU and the state public defender agency say their clients weren't just victims of misconduct by Farak, but also by state prosecutors and the Attorney General's office. A trial judge found that two former assistant attorneys general misled the court and ""tampered with the fair administration of justice"" by withholding evidence about the scope of the chemist's misconduct. Attorneys say prosecutors also failed to notify the people whose cases were tainted by Farak until they brought the matter to the state's highest court., “Prosecutors from the Massachusetts attorney general's office actually misled the courts and the people of Massachusetts about the scope of the scandal,” said Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts. “Worse, when the evidence of tampering came to light, Massachusetts-elected district attorneys again failed to notify thousands of people who had been wrongfully convicted by the tainted evidence, until we sued.”, “The lawyers entrusted with ensuring the integrity of the justice system are the very ones who corrupted it,” said ACLU of Massachusetts legal director Matthew Segal. “Despite what the attorney general's office has done, we are now on the verge of delivering relief to thousands of people, but we won't rest until we also deliver justice.”, Lawsuits against the district attorneys and the attorney general are ongoing., “It’s unfortunate that the ACLU chose to stage a press conference without reading the AG’s brief filed in this case, which calls for speedy relief for these defendants,” Jillian Fennimore, a communications director for Attorney General Maura Healey said in a written statement. “Sonja Farak’s crimes were egregious and, as our filings today make clear, this office has been working hard to resolve these cases as quickly as possible. Staff in the AG’s office have been working hard for months to review databases, identify the Farak defendants, and secure their speedy relief. For the ACLU to suggest otherwise is false and irresponsible.”, The Associated Press contributed to this story. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

137,[New Book Says Colleges Are Hotbeds For Spy Recruitment ],"[Barbara Howard: The spies among us — that is the focus of a new book out by Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Daniel Golden. His new book, “Spy Schools,” takes a hard look at U.S. college campuses as hotbeds of spy activity by both domestic and foreign agents. Dan Golden is a senior editor at ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet. Thanks for coming in, Dan., Golden: Thanks, Barbara. Glad to be here., Howard: So, what sparked your interest in campus spies?, Golden: I did an article about a professor at the University of South Florida. He was born and bred in China, but a U.S. citizen, and the FBI pressured him to spy on China. And they even asked the university to set up a branch in China as a base for his spying. And I thought this was amazing and unique. But intelligence insiders told me “No, no — you know, this is quite common,” the intrusion of U.S. and foreign intelligence into campuses. And so I thought, I have to look more., Howard: Is it new? Was it always this way?, Golden: It's kind of waxed and waned. But globalization has kind of made universities into a front line for espionage, when there's so many foreign students and foreign professors. And some small, but interesting, percentage of them are spying. And at the same time, the FBI and CIA are trying to recruit the foreign students and send them home as agents for us. And universities used to sort of oppose domestic intelligence, but now they can look the other way., Howard: Why? Why did they look the other way?, Golden: Well universities have a financial interest in looking the other way, because in terms of foreign espionage, they're opening branches in foreign countries, they're admitting more and more full-paying foreign students … and so they don't want to upset the apple cart there. And domestically, they get a lot of money for ransom programs from intelligence communities and the Pentagon., Howard: So, we can see why colleges have an incentive to let this go on, but what is it that makes campuses fertile ground for spy recruiting or activities?, Golden: Well, they're very open places. I mean, you can go in there as a spy under some pretext and sidle up to somebody in a library or a cafeteria or an auditorium. And then the targets are appealing: you've got young and impressionable students who maybe you can indoctrinate and steer into a government position. You've got professors who, when the administration changes in Washington, might all of a sudden become important government officials. It's easier to reach these people on a campus than it is once they're in government, and so that's one of the core appeals., I tell a story of a Chinese graduate student at Duke who worked on research that was called basic, but it was funded by the Pentagon and it was to build an invisibility cloak to hide our weapons. And this student essentially poached that research for China, arranged to have Chinese collaborators photograph the equipment, he took the research and put it on a website he started in China. He persuaded the professor through kind of trickery to share his research in China. And Duke woke up too late: the professor took away his key to the lab, but the damage was done, and the student went back to China, started a competing research institute and became a billionaire, ultimately., Howard: So we've heard about a Chinese kid who's done this, has it worked the other way around — American students being recruited by foreign bodies?, Golden: That can happen, particularly in study abroad programs. So I tell the story of a student named Glenn Duffie Shriver who went to a university in Michigan, went abroad to China, liked it that there, went back repeatedly and ultimately was recruited by Chinese intelligence, which paid him $70,000 to try and penetrate the CIA., Howard: What happened to him?, Golden: He was caught and imprisoned., Howard: OK, So you've made some highly charged points in your book that places like Harvard's Kennedy School of Government are aware that there are spies in their midst, but they tend to look the other way. Why would they do that?, Golden: Well what's happening at the Kennedy School, and has for years I found, it’d never been reported before, that CIA intelligence officers go there undercover, particularly into the mid-career program which is rife with foreign targets, future foreign leaders in business and politics. And they use their foreign cover - The CIA does, you know, the cover they have at the embassy overseas as a State Department diplomat or political officer and they're not supposed to officially recruit their classmates. But the whole point of a mid-career program is sort of networking, so they can cozy up to the unwitting foreigner, get to be friends with them, and eventually, you know, use them as an asset when everybody's gone back abroad. And the Kennedy School has very elaborate web of connections with the CIA and with U.S. intelligence. It sends lots of its graduates there. And so again, it doesn't want to offend the CIA, it sees itself as a professional training ground for our government and lets this go on., The interesting thing is some of the foreigners are also spies. I mean, there was a case of a Russian spy going to the mid-career program, who posed as a Canadian under a different name. His name he used at the Kennedy School was Heathfield, but his real name was Andrey Bezrukov. And so it's like at the Kennedy School, you have no idea who you're sitting next to., Howard: I recall he and his wife lived in Cambridge - she was a realtor. Their kids, ostensibly in high school, were unaware of all of this until their parents suddenly were taken away one day and they were left high and dry, it sounds like., Golden: That's right. It was one of the cases that led to the TV show ""The Americans."" But you know, illegals that Russia sort of seeds in the U.S., Howard: OK so, the CIA and other foreign bodies are actively doing things at Harvard's Kennedy School, it sounds like, and you've documented this with CIA agents among the students and instructors there. Does it explain why the Kennedy School was quick to rescind the invitation to Chelsea Manning to speak there?, Golden: Well, it speaks to the clout that the CIA has at the Kennedy School that it would rescind an invitation it had made because of the CIA protesting. It also shows how much times have changed because in the 1970’s. Harvard didn't hesitate to fight with the CIA over the issue of covert spying. Harvard adopted pretty stiff guidelines, saying its faculty and students could not participate in CIA intelligence operations. The CIA pushed back and said it would disregard those guidelines and ultimately, hardly any other universities adopted them and the effort came to naught. Now even Harvard is yielding to CIA intimidation., Howard: Is this activity just at Ivy League schools?, Golden: Not at all. I mean, I have examples in my book of Ivy League schools and other private universities, state universities, even small liberal arts colleges., Howard: So, is there a role to be played in these schools to be helping the CIA?, Golden: I have no problem with overt activity, which would be the CIA coming in holding a career day and inviting people to work for it. You know, my book focuses on the covert, clandestine activities which often involve trickery and those are, I think, inappropriate in an academic context., Howard: OK so John Le Carre, he knows a thing or two about espionage — he's a famous author of spy novels, and he calls your book closely researched, timely and shocking. Well, it is clearly closely researched, it is shocking, but what is it that makes your book timely?, Golden: I mean, obviously, Russian spying is very much in the news. And I have new examples of Russian spying at American universities. Similarly, with Chinese theft of intellectual property, I show that that goes on at universities more broadly, that one of the big political issues today is globalization versus nationalism. I mean, that was — it's sort of the heart of the Trump campaign, Brexit, [the] French presidential campaign, and this is kind of a case study of it. You've got these global institutions, these universities that go across borders, they accept people from all countries based on intelligence and research ability and teaching ability. And then you've got these nationalistic institutions, these intelligence agencies burrowing in and trying to take advantage of that global atmosphere. And so in a way, the biggest currents in the world are reflected in this spy versus spy battle that I chronicle., Howard: OK thanks, Dan., Golden: Thank you., Howard: That's Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist and author Daniel Golden.

138,"[Celtics, GE Foundation Launch Mobile STEM Lab For Area Middle School Students]","[Ask a gym full of middle school students how many of them want to be professional athletes when they grow up, and nearly half of them will raise their hands., “I want to go to the WNBA,” said Chalina Guerrero, an eighth grader who plays for the girls’ basketball team at Frederick Pilot Middle School in Dorchester., As time, ability and luck will show, most of those dreams won’t come true. That’s why a back-up plan is vital. For Guerrero, it’s playing basketball overseas or becoming a lawyer., “The college I want to get into … they look at your grades and your resume,” Guerrero said. “They’re not going to pull someone out for bad grades, they’re going to pull someone out who strives for their dreams, education-wise and athletic-wise.”, During a pep rally Tuesday at Frederick Pilot, the Boston Celtics and the General Electric Foundation collaborated to send this message to students. They encouraged them to pick careers that align with their interests, sports or otherwise, and unveiled the Brilliant Career Play mobile lab designed to engage middle schoolers in hands-on STEM learning. They also stressed that making it to the big leagues doesn’t necessarily mean being on a team roster.  , , “Not everyone can be a pro athlete,"" said Rich Gotham, president of the Boston Celtics. ""The dream ends for all of us at some point, but there’s so many ways you can be involved in sports, sort of off the court or off the field, and increasingly, the people we’re hiring are people with great analytics skills, math, science, technology skills.”, While the STEM workforce continues to grow and evolve, minorities remain underrepresented in the field. As of 2015, blacks and Hispanics make up roughly 11 percent of the science and engineering workforce, according to the National Science Foundation. More than 85 percent of Frederick Pilot Middle’s students are black or Hispanic, and the school is working to produce students who can diversify the industry.  , , “If we are not preparing kids at the at middle school level, they will never have access, exposure, opportunities to really engage in some of the STEM industries and thinking about, ‘what do I want to do?’ That starts in elementary school, so we’re late to the game,” said Pauline Lugira, Frederick Pilot's principal. She added that having role models such as Celtics center Aron Baynes, who was in attendance Tuesday, helps make STEM more attractive., “Sports is not something that is an option for people long-term, for the most part,” Baynes said. “That’s why I have a college degree — I knew I wanted to get that background so that … I always have a fall-back plan.” , , Before the pep rally, Baynes worked with a group of students on a project in the mobile lab that showed how electric circuits work, taking time to offer advice and sign autographs. He was then welcomed into the school gymnasium in a similar fashion to how he’s welcomed at TD Garden at the start of a Celtics home game., “Last but not least, all the way from Australia, the big guy himself … please make some noise for No. 36, Aron Baynes!” the announcer exclaimed over high-energy music. Cheers and screams from the students followed as Baynes walked along the bleachers giving them high fives. It was the closest some of them had ever been to someone famous. And he wasn’t just any special guest — he was someone they watched on TV, and thus, his words would leave an impression., , , “A lot of kids don’t get to meet NBA players, let alone touch them and talk to them like I have,” said eighth grader Nate Ashton. “He taught me … sometimes less is better than having more. That’s a motto that I like to live by — sometimes you don’t need everything for you to be successful.”, Ashton said that as a “regular kid at a regular school” with limited financial resources, it was great to hear that message., Over the next several weeks, Frederick Pilot students will engage in STEM activities and lessons. The Brilliant Career Play lab will continue making its way to public schools around Boston and across the state., Paris Alston is a former Digital Production Assistant for WGBH News.]"

140,"[In An Unlikely Partnership, Local Environmentalists And Utilities Work Together To Reduce Gas Leaks]","[Environmental activists have long seen natural gas utilities as something of a foe. While natural gas may be cleaner than coal, it’s still a fossil fuel, and environmentalists worry about its impact on climate change. But environmentalists and gas companies in Massachusetts are doing something unusual — they’re teaming up to try to fix something they both agree is a problem., On a quiet road in Lexington, Jason Taylor held a device that looked like a stick with a little suction cup at the end, and slowly waved it low over the ground like a metal detector at the beach. But what he was looking for is a natural gas leak., “So it basically starts somewhere around here,"" he said as the device started to beep. ""You can hear that right now as I bring the wand along where it is.” He put it in a hole in the dirt lane and the numbers on the detector started climbing., “Twenty four percent of this — what's coming through this little suction cup right here — 24 percent of what it's reading is gas,” he said., Taylor’s working with a non-profit group called HEET, which stands for the Home Energy Efficiency Team. He and the group’s founder, Audrey Schulman, stretched out a tape measure to figure out how much the leak has spread. “OK, 173 feet,"" Taylor called out. ""Now we've just got to do the width.”, , As they worked, Max Chiang, who lives on this road, pulled up in his car and asked what they’re up to. He said the leak has been here for more than a decade. “I don't know how many times I reported it,"" Chiang said. ""I guess they don't think it's a big deal or whatever. I don’t know. But they just — nobody takes care of it.”, The gas companies don’t fix an estimated 16,000 leaks like this around the state, because they don’t pose a safety risk. But Schulman said they do pose a risk to the environment. “Natural gas is over 90 percent methane. Methane is a greenhouse gas on steroids,” she said., For years, Shulman’s organization and another environmental advocacy group called Mothers Out Front have been trying to get the gas companies to do something about the leaks. Initially, getting the utility’s cooperation was a challenge., “The relationship in the past was really, really contentious,"" Schulman said. ""In general, HEET would — my nonprofit — would release some sort of report in the press and the utilities would come back with some angry statement, and I would respond with some angrier statement, and we would both cast aspersions upon each other's facts, knowledge, clothing. Like, anything we could.”  , But one day, a utility executive responded differently, saying more information on gas leaks could help his company. “And I was so startled by that, that I think that that was the moment when I began to realize we might be able to all work together,"" Schulman said., And that’s what they did. The gas utilities started meeting with HEET and Mothers Out Front to try to come up with a solution to the environmental problem. “We all realized we had the same goals, which is to fix the biggest leaks first,” Schulman said. That’s because half of the methane that’s being released is coming from just 7 percent of the leaks., , A state law passed last year actually mandates that the gas companies identify and fix those leaks. But the challenge was figuring out which ones are the worst., To attempt to do this, a team of Eversource workers in hard hats and orange vests gathered in the middle of a Somerville intersection and drilled a hole in the street. Kevin Kelley of Eversource pointed out a device as they inserted it into the hole. “That's the flux bar,” he said. This new technology is a part of what they hope is the solution, because it’s a relatively easy and cost-effective way to tell how far a leak is spreading., , “Now we're actually measuring the amount of gas that's under the ground that could escape to the atmosphere,” Kelley said. And Eversource and the state’s other gas utilities will ultimately use that information to fix the worst leaks. That’s a fundamental shift in the company’s approach to this., “We always looked at leaks from a risk perspective,"" Kelley said. ""And we started looking at the emission piece of it over the last, you know, two or three years with Mothers Out Front and HEET and other groups pressing the issue. And it really opened our eyes to work with them and come up with solutions to, you know, address their issues.”, , It’s a bit of a ""strange bedfellows"" situation, especially since Mothers Out Front and HEET actually want to see the natural gas industry replaced by renewable energy sources like solar and wind. But Kelley says as they’ve talked through the issue, the environmentalists have been respectful and realistic.  And for now, everyone’s decided to put their differences aside, really listen to each other, and work together to reduce a powerful greenhouse gas spilling into the atmosphere. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
141,[Boston City Council Votes Unanimously To Ban Plastic Bags],"[	Boston's City Council voted unanimously on Wednesday in favor of an ordinance that would ban the use of flimsy plastic bags at checkout counters and would require businesses to charge a nickel each for sturdier plastic bags and for paper bags with handles. 
	 
	Specifically, the ordinance bans all plastic bags thinner than 3 mils, or 3 thousandths of an inch. 
	 
	The ordinance has been kicking around Council for more than a year, while Council members listened to public comment, met with industry representatives, and assembled support from environmental groups, neighborhood associations and even Girl Scouts. 
	 
	And casting a shadow over the effort has been Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who has said in the past that he was opposed to the measure and, while he did say this week that he was ""open"" to it, has declined to say whether he'll sign the ordinance even after Wednesday's unanimous vote. 
	 
	Were Walsh to veto the measure, the Council could override with a two-thirds majority.
	 
	Cities around the state and around the country have passed similar measures, including Cambridge, Brookline, Somerville and Watertown.  
	 
	Speaking before the vote, City Councilor Matt O'Malley, the ordinance's lead sponsor, said the time had come to pass the ban in Boston, citing both the large-scale environmental impacts of plastic (including the alarming rise of plastic found in the bodies of fish and other wildlife) -- and local impacts. 
	 
	""They end up in our streets, in our storm gutters, in our trees, tangled, in our wildlife and in our marine ecosystem,"" O'Malley said. 
	 
	""I would argue that as it stands we are currently paying a fee for these plastic bags,"" he added, noting that the city's recycling contractor has said that it is tasked with trying to remove some twenty tons of plastic bags from the city recycling stream every week. 
	 
	""Our department of Public Works, Water and Sewer, Parks, and other city employees spend time cleaning up these bags from trees, from parks, from lots, from storm drains, from waterways.""
	 
	Council President Michelle Wu, a co-sponsor and strong supporter of the ban, called it a""small change that will have a major impact."" She described the vote as a meaningful step in the Council's larger effort to step up to the challenges the city will face from global climate change. 
	 
	""It's about taking that affirmative step and joining every other community that has made the statement that 'We are going to take responsibility for climate justice; We're going to take responsibility for our role in protecting and ensuring a livable future for generations to come.""
	 
	Reaction from opponents and supporters was swift. Shortly after the vote, the American Progressive Bag Alliance, which lobbies on behalf of plastic bag manufacturers and related plastic industry interests, released a statement saying it was a ""a shame that City Councilors pushed through a tax that will hit seniors and low-income families the hardest in the middle of the holiday shopping season,"" -- though the ordinance does not take full effect until next year. 
	 
	The Massachusetts-based Conservation Law Foundation, in its own statement, praised the ordinance while shifting attention to the noticeable silence on the matter that has come from the Mayor's Office in recent days.
	 
	""We are optimistic that Mayor Walsh will follow the lead of 59 other Massachusetts cities and towns,"" the statement noted, ""and sign this ordinance into law.”
	 
	A spokesperson for Walsh said the mayor was ""still reviewing"" the bill.  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

148,"[The Massachusetts Coyote: Bigger, Wolfier, But Not To Be Feared]","[Judy Place describes a scene straight out of a horror movie. She was being stalked by a rabid animal, in her case, a coyote., The deranged creature had wandered out of the woods around the river that runs behind the trailer park complex where Place lives with her mother. The coyote had been menacing her and other neighbors, turning over lawn furniture and attacking random objects., Then one evening, she heard a couple of loud banging sounds, like something was trying to get underneath her trailer home. She went to the window, where she “saw something scurrying away.  I said, ‘Oh boy, I think that’s the coyote!’"", She called the North Attleboro police, who sent over two officers. When they arrived, their flashlights revealed a large section of siding that had been pulled away, leaving a gaping hole under the house., ""I said, 'oh my gosh, she’s in there, I’m going in the house.'”, But the coyote had slipped around the side of the house, where it was waiting for her. , Place backed away, avoiding eye contact, but the coyote came after her.  “She just latched right on to my leg,” she said. , Place says that in the shock of the moment, she didn’t feel the pain from the bite. Amazingly, she managed to keep calm, and stay still., “I don’t know what I was thinking at the time, ‘cause you know, you’re in shock. So I basically thought to myself, ‘Don’t move too much,’ because she might think I was trying to fight her…things are going through my head like I don’t even know.”, The officers shot the animal twice with a Taser. The electroshock gun can take down a large man, but the coyote would not let go. Finally one of the officers fired a shot in the air, which, “scared the coyote enough to get off of me. So I beelined back into my house.”, Once inside, Place heard another two shots.  The first wounded the coyote, which then turned on one of the officers who had to fire the second, fatal shot., Testing confirmed rabies was the reason for the coyote’s bizarre behavior and attack. Place is now getting a series of shots to prevent her from contracting the fatal disease., The incident was terrifying, but it’s important to know that Coyote attacks are extremely rare. Place is only the ninth person bitten in Massachusetts since the state started keeping records in the 1950s. The fact is, you’re more likely to get killed by lightning than injured by a coyote., Still, they can be intimidating animals — the Eastern Coyote is a bigger, more robust animal than its Western cousin. That’s because they’re part wolf., “As they came east and interbred with the wolf, they became larger,” said Christine Schadler, a wild canid ecologist and the author of Becoming Wolf: The Eastern Coyote in New England. , “Our animals are 35 to 60 pounds. The largest [Eastern] coyote documented is 62 pounds, which is the same size as a small Eastern Wolf,” said Schadler., “All the animals in New England are this hybrid animal,” said Jon Way, a researcher involved with some of the recent studies that revealed the genetic makeup of Eastern Coyotes in Massachusetts. They found that “about 25 or 30 percent of its DNA is Eastern Wolf. And a little bit of gray wolf.  A total of 25 to 30 percent Wolf, and maybe 60 to 65 percent coyote, and then about 10 percent dog.”  Way thinks it’s more correct to refer to this animal as a 'coywolf,' to recognize its uniqueness as a species., Schadler says that the wolf DNA is behind “significant differences in the eastern coyote that makes this animal unique. One is the ability to live in a pack, which is very different than the coyote out west.”  , Combined with their larger size, living in packs could make the coywolves, as Way calls them, better predators of large animals like deer. “They're kind of genetically plastic, where they can survive on small prey,” like rodents, that typically make up the majority of the coyote’s diet. But thanks to their body size, the Eastern Coyote may be “more able to prey on deer than western coyotes are,” said Way. , Place says she could see the wolf in the coyote that attacked her. , “The face of it looked exactly like a wolf. I kept saying, ‘I don’t think we have wolves in this area,' so thought I was losing it,” she laughed. “But yeah, it did — it resembled a wolf.” , Place says she remains spooked by the attack, and now feels a little scared outside, but still loves living near abundant wildlife, including the coyotes. , She has two more rabies shots to go before she’s in the clear., Arun Rath is the host of WGBH News' All Things Considered. ]"

150,[Greater Boston Housing Costs Still Rising],"[Barbara Howard: Housing costs in Greater Boston, continuing to rise. That's according to the annual report on housing in the region released today by the Boston Foundation. The report's author, Barry Bluestone, is on the line. He is a professor of public policy at Northeastern University. Hi, Professor Bluestone., Barry Bluestone: Hello., Howard: So your report found that in Greater Boston, not in the city itself, home prices and rents are still going up?, Bluestone: That's exactly right. Home prices continue to rise, rents for most of the region have been rising, more and more people are finding it more difficult to find housing they can afford, particularly close to the city. As a result, more and more working families are looking for housing outside of Boston, further and further away, and that's starting to raise prices even faster in some of the outer communities than in some of the communities inside Boston., Howard: Where are the biggest increases?, Bluestone: One of them is Lawrence, Massachusetts, you know, traditionally a working class city where housing has been quite affordable, but enough people have found it necessary to move further away to Lawrence and other communities north of the city and south of the city, that it's putting pressure on prices and prices are rising as much as 10 to 12 percent per year for single-family homes., Howard: Is it fair to say that the working class is the class being squeezed the most?, Bluestone: Absolutely. Boston, of course, has been home to people with a lot of wealth. It's also, however, been home to people with low incomes because Boston, unlike some other cities, like San Francisco, [has] actually created a lot of public housing so that very low income people who can qualify for public housing or rent subsidies can still live here. The folks who can't live here, or are finding it very difficult, or spending 30, 40, 50 percent or more of their income for rent or a mortgage, are working families, you know, families probably in the greater Boston area, somewhere between $50,000 and $60,000 and $110,00, $120,000 — for them, housing has become very, very difficult., Howard: What's driving the high prices?, Bluestone: Well what's driving the high prices is actually good news. We have a strong, buoyant economy, probably the strongest in the country with all of the great industries we have here. We are attracting large numbers of people to come here to work, particularly young people. We haven't kept up housing supply to match housing demand, so this is one of the cases where the most simple of economics, supply and demand, can explain this. What's bringing the young people here, of course, are lots of jobs, but also all of our universities, our teaching hospitals, our graduate students, interns, residents, and they are partly responsible for driving up, particularly rents, by two, three, four of them getting together, like my own graduate students, renting the third floor of a triple-decker. And because of that, this older housing stock, the duplexes and triple-deckers, are now being priced out of the market., Howard: So we're seeing the costs on the rise throughout the metropolitan area outside of Boston itself, but what about Boston itself? Is it even worse there?, Bluestone: Well Boston prices, home prices of course, are in the millions of dollars now, on average. Condo prices have tended to, over the last year, have finally slowed down. I think the average condo price is a little over $400,000. Now this is a one or two-bedroom condo, and that's because we've built a lot of condominiums over the last three or four years., Howard: In your report this year, you've come up with some recommendations to help bring the housing costs down. Give me some of those recommendations., Bluestone: Well this is the first report in these 15 years of reports in which we've actually laid out at 10-step program to meet the housing challenge, and it's based on the new demography. The new demography of greater Boston are young people 20 to 34, who are getting 10 years older over the next 10 years, and seniors like myself, 65 and over. We need smaller housing. We need housing that's easier to maintain. And what we need to do is put together a real coalition. We're calling for the governor, we're calling for the mayors to get together, to bring together architects, developers, finance people, construction trades, to build what I call 21st century villages. These will be multi-family housing units, apartments, condos, lots of common space, lots of common amenities, to attract young people from the triple-deckers and the duplexes into this new housing, freeing up some of the old housing originally built for working families at a more reasonable price., Howard: Thanks so much for joining us, Barry Bluestone., Bluestone: A pleasure to be with you., Howard: That's Barry Bluestone. He's professor of public policy at Northeastern University. He is the author of a new report out today from the Boston Foundation on the housing situation in and around Boston. He has a set of recommendations to help bring the prices under control.

152,[ACLU Responds To Scaramucci's Threat To Sue Tufts Student],"[Barbara Howard: Do you remember Anthony Scaramucci? He was the White House communications director for 10 days this summer. He's a Tufts University alum and he was scheduled to speak at Tufts today, but the school's put that event on hold, and that is because Scaramucci is threatening to sue his alma mater's student newspaper as well as Tufts graduate student Camilo Caballero. Caballero published a pair of op-eds this month in that student newspaper, The Tuft’s Daily, that called for Scaramucci to be removed from the advisory board of Tufts' Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. Scaramucci wants those op-eds to be retracted and he's demanding an apology. Camilo Caballero is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, and with us on the line is the ACLU's Executive Director, Carol Rose. Hi, Carol., Carol Rose: Hi, good to be with you, Barbara., Howard: So does your client, Caballero, plan to respond?, Rose: Yes, of course, we'll respond to this threatening letter from Mr. Scaramucci. Sending a graduate student a legal demand letter accusing him of libel two days before Thanksgiving and then demanding a response within five business days is plainly mean-spirited., Howard: The demand letter threatens to sue., Rose: You know, but I think it's important for people to realize that we're not going to allow Mr. Scaramucci or anyone else close to or associated with the Trump administration to suddenly begin to use the defamation law to try to bully journalists into silence., Howard: So one of the sticking points for Scaramucci, it seems, is that your client's op-eds refer to him as unethical. One passage reads that he, Scaramucci, is, quote “an unethical opportunist who exuded the highest degree of disreputability.” Now Scaramucci is taking to Twitter all over this, writing, quote “Can't write defamatory statements. People are entitled to their own opinions, but not to their own facts. Read the case law on this. It is well grounded,” end quote. So it appears that Scaramucci believes he has a case. What do you think?, Rose: Mr. Scaramucci has two hurdles. One is that initially, he has to show that it's provably false, and that's a big hurdle. And beyond that, and the bigger hurdle that he faces, is that as a public figure, Mr. Scaramucci — and other similarly situated public figures — can't recover from a person who publishes something about conduct or fitness unless the defendant, the student newspaper, knew that the statement was false and then acted in reckless disregard of the statements truth or falsity. So this is a very high standard, it’s the actual malice standard. It doesn't mean ill will, but it means, really, a knowing publication of something that's false., Howard: So you're claiming Caballero believes that what he wrote is factually accurate?, Rose: Of course he stands behind what he wrote, but I think the legal standard is even higher than that and the burden is on Mr. Scaramucci to show that it's not. That's a very high standard. And the reason that the courts have imposed such a high standard when talking about public officials is that we want to encourage both the press and the public to be able to speak out to dissent against their government and public figures, to be able to criticize public officials and public figures, because that's so crucial to our democracy. Now we know that President Trump has made statements in the past saying that he'd like to see a change in the libel law, he’d like to be able to go after people who criticize him in the public, and it seems like in this case, I guess the apple doesn't fall very far from the trough., Howard: What step will your client be taking next?, Rose: So in terms of looking at what his legal claims are, we'll definitely have some sort of a response on behalf of Mr. Caballero. And most importantly, we're going to have a response on behalf of the Fourth Estate, freedom of the press, and the American people., Howard: OK. Thanks for joining us, Carol Rose., Rose: Thank you, Barbara., Howard: That’s Carol Rose, Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. The ACLU is representing Tufts University graduate student Camilo Caballero, who has been threatened with a defamation suit by former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Scaramucci says that unless Caballero retracts the op-eds that he published in the Tufts students newspaper that were critical of him and apologizes, he says he will sue., WGBH News did reach out to Scaramucci’s lawyer, Sam Lieberman, for comment. He responded with a statement he says was authorized by Scaramucci. It reads, in part, quote “the claim that Mr. Scaramucci is an unethical opportunist who exuded the highest degree of disreputability was presented as a fact, but has no basis whatsoever. As a public figure and investment advisor, Mr. Scaramucci will vigorously defend his integrity against false allegations. Mr. Caballero can end this now by apologizing for the statements where he crossed the line."", Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

Personal prejudices and the struggle for acceptance can complicate the strongest familial relationships., This tension is the subject of Richard Blanco’s poem, “Queer Theory: According To My Grandmother.” He joined Boston Public Radio today to talk about the meaning behind his poem., “It’s really about shaping my behavior and also kind of surveilling — the constant source of surveillance and of verbal abuse, in a way,” Blanco said. “Just always being told what to be, how to act, how to talk, how to walk, how to sit, and all the rest.”, Blanco says his grandmother was both his “best friend” and his “arch enemy.” In the poem, she is teaching him to “be a man and pass, in a way” avoiding femininity by following her rules., According to Blanco, she pressured him to embrace a more macho role as her Cuban grandson., “She was my primary caretaker, and so what you see here, in a way, is an odd tenderness or an odd expression of love,” said Blanco., Read the poem below:, Queer Theory: According to My Grandmother, Never drink soda with a straw—, milk shakes?

161,[Museum Of African American History At 50: Five Things You Might Not Know ],"[Here at the Curiosity Desk we love Massachusetts history, and we especially love lesser-known stories and tales. And so, when we learned that Boston’s Museum of African American History was turning 50 this year, we thought it might be an opportunity to touch on a little of both., And so, to satisfy — and perhaps rouse — your curiosity, The Curiosity Desk presents five things, some of which you might not have known, about this venerable institution on its golden anniversary., 1. Massachusetts Has A Museum Of African American History, ""I think the first thing is that it's here,"" said Marita Rivero, the museum's executive director. ""I’m tired of having people say it’s the best kept secret in Boston."", ""Here,"" in Boston, is placid Joy Street, tucked away on the north slope of Beacon Hill. But the museum is not just a Boston institution. In addition to its spaces in the city, the museum also has a presence on Nantucket, where they present exhibits and cultural programs at two historic sites.  , 2. Two Important Historic Buildings Comprise Their Boston Campus, , First, there is the Abiel Smith School, which was the first building in America constructed as a public school for black children. Today it houses the museum’s exhibition space, a classroom, and the museum store. Then there’s the African Meeting House, the oldest black church edifice still standing in America. , ""I tell people if they knew nothing and walked in the door they’d understand these were people who understood beauty,"" said Rivero, sitting with me in a back pew. ""They were wonderful craftspeople. They raised the money themselves to build this."", This space was far more than a place of worship. It was an indispensable community hub for a vibrant free black community on Beacon Hill in the 19th century. Today it’s a fully-restored national historic site, with many of its original features in-tact, including the floorboards., 3. The Titans Who Walked The Floors , ""We know the abolitionists walked these floors,"" said Rivero ""This community was really focused on ending slavery."" , That included African-American pioneers like Frederick Douglass and white leaders like William Lloyd Garrison, who founded the New England Anti-slavery society here. , During the Civil War, Douglass and others recruited young black men — including Douglass’ two sons — who walked up the aisle here to officially enlist in Massachusetts' famed 54th regiment., Then there were the lesser-known trailblazers like Maria Stewart who, among other things, is believed to be the first woman to speak to a ""mixed"" audience of men and women, white and black., ""People don’t know her,"" said Rivero. ""She was an early feminist who lived down the street. [She] spoke here [and] was passionate about liberation and freedom. I think it’s important to recognize that early feminists were black women."", 4. The Museum Created The Black Heritage Trail , The African Meeting House — as well as the homes of some of its former members — are today part of a walking tour called the Black Heritage Trail, something the museum created years ago., ""This whole area and all the houses on the Black Heritage Trail, and many beyond us, were part of groups called the Vigilance Committee,"" said Rivero., That committee provided everything from shelter and funds, to transportation and legal counsel, to hundreds of slaves who had escaped the American south in the decades leading up to the Civil War.  , ""To understand who these people were, men and women, to see ourselves — frankly — in this story, I think of it as a great civic engagement tale,"" said Rivero., 5. The Civic Engagement Tale Continues , Today, the museum presents exhibitions throughout the year, and offers regular tours of its historic spaces, where they also hold lectures, concerts and community events. Rivero says this now 50-year-old organization is committed to making this 200-year old building — and its countless stories —  accessible to everyone. Her hope is that by remembering who we were, we might yet discover who we can become., ""We were all here,"" she said. ""This was a seaport town. People from [China] were here. People from the Caribbean, Latin America, South America — they were all here. Eastern Europe, Western Europe — we were all here. And the more we tell those stories and acquaint all of ourselves with the idea that we’re one people, we’ve been in touch with one another over many, many years – the better we’ll be able to take on the issues of our time."" , If there is something you've been curious about, let me know. Email me at curiositydesk@wgbh.org. I need to get my story ideas from somewhere, why not you? , Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"

163,[Preventing Homelessness Among Lowell's Veterans],"[With the winter months upon us, keeping people in housing is a priority — especially those in the veteran community., Lowell is the one of the latest cities to be certified by the U.S. government as succeeding in ending homelessness among veterans, partly due to the work of the Veterans' Northeast Outreach Center, which prioritizes helping servicemembers have a place to call home. The center has been around since 1985, and last year, it helped about 100,000 veterans with housing, counseling and job training., Laura Labrecque and her partner, Timothy Dillon, of Lowell served tough tours of duty in the military overseas. Life back home hasn’t been easy. This time last year, they were facing eviction., “We did have an eviction notice because the landlords weren't getting along. So we had a few issues, but finding first, last and security to move is a lot while you're still paying rent at another place,"" Labrecque explained, referring the three months rent needed to move elsewhere., Facing the threat of homelessness, Labrecque said the couple turned to the veteran community for support. “We were referred over to the [Veterans' Northeast Outreach Center],” she said., Kelly McEachrin, a program coordinator at the center, specifically deals with housing. He says he helped about 500 veterans with housing issues last year., “We received the phone call from our section of a veteran needing assistance. I met with the client in our conference room,"" he said, referring to Labrecque and Dillon. ""The first thing we do, is we assess the veteran — are you a veteran? What's your need? Which in this case, it was rental arrears. And we look and see where they're located,” McEachrin said., , In each case, McEachrin and his team of case managers customize a solution. In this case, they provided money so the family could move., “They paid a portion of us getting in. So, our first and security was paid, so we had to pay last month's and moving expenses, and we paid the rent at the other location while we were transitioning,” a grateful Labrecque said., McEachrin says the organization's first priority is making sure veterans have a place to live., “Our target goal is to help veterans to provide that initial need within 24 hours, and then progressively work to meet that overall need within a 90-day period,” he said., With help from the center, the couple moved their family into an apartment. Labrecque said it made a huge difference., “It's a sense of relief they bent over backwards to help us,"" she said. ""It was the biggest relief we could have at the time we needed it most.”, McEachrin said every veteran in Lowell who has asked for housing assistance has received it., “Lowell has met functional zero for homeless veterans. It means that every veteran that has asked for assistance has received assistance,” he said. ""There are veterans who refuse assistance. We can't force that.”, The assistance has been a life saver for Labrecque and Dillon., “You see a lot of programs for alcoholics or [people] coming out of prison. All these reform programs that are great. You don't see that for people that served their country,"" Labrecque said. ""It's nice to know there are programs, though they're far and few between, there should be more ... to help prevent us from being on the streets and our children being on the streets."", Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"

169,[Reading Between A Day Of MBTA Headlines],"[The MBTA's Fiscal and Management Control Board's marathon Monday meeting was one for the books., In the course of about five consecutive hours, the Board approved a contract for the long-awaited and $2+ billion Green Line Extension and green-lighted a plan to move to a system-wide ""cashless"" fare collection system.  , But as is usually the case, the details of the board's meetings were more muddled than the headlines that emerged., The Board also moved, just after the TV cameras had left, to endorse a controversial proposal to lift the ban on the advertising of alcohol on MBTA property., And for all the camaraderie when it came to the first two big-ticket items, the board only narrowly passed a motion to approve the plan to lift the alcohol ad ban: the motion passed 3-2, with board member Brian Lang and board chairman Joseph Aiello casting “no” votes., Lang, the most outspoken on the board -- and who had voted against the measure last week -- noted that he had received emails thanking him for his opposition, and took issue with the characterization, by T staff, of the ban-lifting as a “pilot” program, aimed at collecting more data on revenue., The question of revenue, Lang said, was clear., “Alcohol advertising generates significant revenue, that's why we want to do it,” Lang said, “And I caution us on moving toward the money at the expense of social impact - I just think that we're better than that.”, Meanwhile, the day’s vote to approve a “cashless” fare collection system invited more scrutiny than was perhaps obvious., MassDOT Secretary Stephanie Pollack made a point of emphasizing that the plan in question was not a “cash-less system,” -- meaning that riders will still be able to use cash to add value to Charlie Cards (or the new Charlie Cards anticipated under the new system) and will not only rely on online, credit card, or new-fangled payment systems., But the fact remains that even though T staff say new payment systems will be more accessible and widespread than the so often hard-to-come-by Charlie Card dispensers -- they won’t be available at every bus stop, which means that bus riders in particular will need to be ready to pay -- new-style -- when they get on the bus at their local stop., Among other tidbits: While the T has advertised that its new non-cash payment systems will allow riders to use credit cards, the presentation made to the board mentioned only “contactless” credit cards -- devices unlike the conventional credit (or debit) cards used in most of the United States., The T anticipates that such cards will be more readily available and used two years from now, when they roll out the program in earnest -- but they remain fairly obscure in this country right now., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

171,"[From Salem, Satanism (Of A Sort) Goes National]","[Listen to the audio version of this story;, , From the outside, there’s nothing exceptional about the large storage shed that sits just off of Bridge Street, a busy road in Salem., But on the inside — which houses a massive bronze statue of Baphomet, a widely recognizable representation of Satan — it's another story., ""It carries all these binary elements, which to us spoke to this idea of the reconciliation of opposites and pluralism,"" Lucien Greaves, the co-founder of and spokesman for the Satanic Temple, says of the sculpture. ""The animal, the human. Pointing up, pointing down. The male and female."", The Satanic Temple created the statue for the Oklahoma state capitol building, to counterbalance a controversial monument there to the Ten Commandments. But in 2015, Oklahoma’s Supreme Court ordered the latter monument’s removal., So now, Baphomet could be headed south — specifically, to Arkansas's state capitol in Little Rock., ""Arkansas has already denied our monument going on their grounds,"" Greaves says. ""However, they’re moving forward with putting up [a] Ten Commandments monument."", ""We are going to sue Arkansas, there’s no doubt about that,"" Greaves adds — explaining that, as he sees it, there's no legal justification for allowing one public religious monument while banning another., As the case of the storage-shed Baphomet suggests, the Satanic Temple isn't engaged in the sort of activity that usually springs to mind when you hear the word ""Satanism,"" their ill-fated attempt to re-enact a ""Black Mass"" at Harvard in 2014 notwithstanding., Instead, the group defines itself as a ""religious organization"" that's opposed to ""tyrannical authority,"" and regards Satan not as a supernatural entity, but as a symbol of personal autonomy and critical inquiry., , Guided by those core premises, the Satanic Temple watches for what it considers egregious breaches of the church-state divide and then enters the fray — arguing that if Christianity can cross certain lines, Satanists can, too. , Another example: After-School Satan Clubs, which are causing a stir in places like Arizona, and boast both a cheery logo and a promotional video that resembles a horror film. , Despite the kitsch, Greaves says, the After-School Satan campaign highlights a serious issue: across the country, so-called Good News Clubs, sponsored by the Child Evangelism Fellowship, are pitching fundamentalist Christianity in public schools., By proposing a provocative counterpoint, he adds, the Satanic Temple was able to generate a slew of media coverage, and spark a conversation that wouldn't have occurred otherwise. , ""Just the very idea that ... we were applying to have nine After-School Satan Clubs to counteract them brought the Good News Clubs into public consciousness, which was already a win for us,"" Greaves says. , The Satanic Temple also plays another angle. It identifies practices it finds objectionable, like school-based corporal punishment in Texas, or abortion restrictions in Missouri. And then it urges people to push back — and litigate — by claiming those practices violate the constitutionally guaranteed free exercise of their Satanic religious beliefs., ""We feel that due to our tenets, the body is inviolable, subject to one’s will alone,"" Greaves says. ""[And] on religious principle, we rely on science as the arbiter of truth claims."", So far, Greaves admits, the anti-corporal punishment campaign hasn’t taken off. But a lawsuit challenging Missouri’s abortion policies has reached that state’s Supreme Court., All of which raises an obvious question: Is the Satanic Temple a real religion? Or just a clever way to provoke and challenge the religious right?, It's worth noting, as you ponder this question, that the Satanic Temple's own literature describes it as a ""poison pill"" in the church-state debate — and that other self-described Satanists have aggressively challenged the Satanic Temple's authenticity., But Greaves — whose moniker, it's also worth noting, is an alias — insists that while the Satanic Temple may not fit traditional conceptions of religion in general, or Satanism in particular, its beliefs are both sincere and deeply held., ""We have a sense of culture and ethics and a narrative structure that really binds us together,"" Greaves says., ""The political battles we fight aren’t all there is to it. And I feel that, even if we didn’t have these fights to fight, most of us would still be here, and we’d still have this sense of community, and we’d still be who we are."", And however one defines the Satanic Temple, its approach currently seems to be working like a charm. , Adam Reilly is a reporter at WGBH-TV's Greater Boston.]"

John Hyten, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, described his plan in Canada last week. “If it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen? I‘m going to say, ‘Mr. President, that’s illegal,'"" he said., News analyst Charlie Sennott called the general’s attempt at reassurance “disconcerting.”, “We have a real problem in the White House when we actually have, for the first time in 40 years, a debate around the authorization of whether and how the president is allowed to use the nuclear codes in a nuclear strike,” Sennott said. “We’re thinking about people who don’t trust his ability to make that decision or to do it rationally.”, Sennott said Hyten is tasked with reminding the president what is and isn’t illegal when it comes to a nuclear strike., “I don’t think we’ve ever had someone in the White House with this low a level of experience of governing. This is a president who has never governed,” he said. “He doesn’t understand legal processes. He doesn’t seem to respect protocol or tradition, and when you get to the nuclear codes, tradition, law, governance, sanity — all these things really, really matter.”, Charlie Sennott is a news analyst here at WGBH where he also heads up the Ground Truth Project.

177,[Construction Work Can Be Dangerous. Now There’s Evidence Of Another Risk: Addiction],"[Medford teenagers are making the kind of choices parents applaud., “Underage drinking numbers are going down,” said Penelope Funaiole, the city’s prevention and outreach coordinator. “Prescription drug use is going down tremendously.”, Here’s what doesn’t make sense. The number of people in Medford dying from opioid overdoses has climbed steadily. There were 17 fatal overdoses last year, and dozens more in the previous four years., Funaiole wanted to know why., She found answers in the city’s death records. Between 2012 and 2015, they revealed that 75 percent of overdoses were among men. Funaiole and her team also noticed another common factor., “We were like, wait a minute,” said Funaiole, “there’s a lot of people that are working in one particular area.”, More than half of Medford’s opioid overdose victims worked in the trades — an umbrella term for everything from highly skilled people building skyscrapers to day laborers picking up the occasional painting job. Working with the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition, the Medford team discovered a similar trend in five nearby towns. Death records from Malden, Melrose, Stoneham, Wakefield and Reading indicated 42 percent of overdose deaths were among men who worked in the trades., “Are the ones on the job site necessarily the ones who are overdosing and dying? I don’t know,” said Funaiole. “That may just be their most recent occupation.”, The public health group followed up with dozens of constructions workers who suggested one reason people in their industry may be vulnerable to addiction: a link between getting hurt on the job and then hooked on pain killers., “They’re given a prescription ... to nullify the pain. And these drugs are very powerful,” said Funaiole. “They can really take over operations in your brain.”, ""They're given a prescription ... to nullify the pain.  And these drugs are very powerful.  They can really take over operations in your brain"" - Penelope Funaiole, Medford prevention and outreach coordinator , But Joe Blades, a 33-year-old pipe fitter, said his addiction started long before he ever put on a hard hat., “I had been using drugs since I was 15, 16 years old,” said Blades., Growing up in Melrose, Blades hit his teens just as opioid pain killers hit the streets — in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s. He says he got into the trades, in part, because he knew he’d make enough money to buy drugs., But, eventually, he got caught. , “I failed a drug test,” said Blades. “If I didn’t fail a drug test, I don’t think that I would have gotten the help that I needed.”, His union got him into treatment and he’s been sober for seven years.  , “I’m one of those success stories,” said Blades. “It doesn’t happen for everybody.”, Blades makes a distinction the death records fail to capture. Bigger jobs have built-in safeguards — the kind that caught his addiction. Then there’s smaller ones that offer easy money with little oversight., “Pay me $200 and then that’s all I need for, you know, whatever I need to do,” said Blades. “It’s not always about, ‘I think he needs help.’”, The Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition hopes to change that mentality. They produced two ads that aired on Boston sports radio stations. Amid a whir of machinery in the background, a male voice says,“You don’t want someone to lose their job, you want them to keep it. Recovery starts with one person helping another.”, The death record data revealed something else about the people who may be most in need of help.  They’re largely men born in the mid to late 1980s, who came of age, like Joe Blades, when opioid pain killers first became available as both prescription and party drugs., Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

180,[FCC Lifts Ban On Cross-Ownership Of Media Outlets: What Does It Mean For Boston?],"[Barbara Howard: The Federal Communications Commission, the FCC, has voted to lift a more than 40-year-old ban on cross-ownership in media markets. It's also loosened restrictions on owning multiple television stations in a single market. The FCC commissioners voted along party lines: three Republicans prevailing over two Democrats. In the studio to talk about all of this is Northeastern University journalism professor and WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy. Thanks for coming in, Dan., Dan Kennedy: Thanks for having me., Howard: What was the original ban on cross-ownership designed to do?, Kennedy: Well, it was designed to encourage a diversity of voices in a local news market. So naturally, there would be a business incentive for TV stations to buy newspapers and they would combine their newsrooms and it might mean more profits for the owners of those properties, but it would mean less choice in news and coverage of the community., Howard: Narrower views, it sounds like., Kennedy: Absolutely., Howard: Does this decision from the FCC mean that we're going to see, like, the Boston Globe or the Boston Herald, what have you, moving into television and radio?, Kennedy: Well there's a possibility of that. You know, one argument that the FCC makes is that the newspaper business, in particular, is in bad shape and the local TV news business is not in as good a shape as it used to be, and so therefore, why not combine them and let them save on costs and perhaps do better journalism. But it's unlikely that it's going to work out that way. Boston Globe owner John Henry has expressed interest in television for a long time. This opens up some more possibilities. Pat Purcell, the owner of the Boston Herald, has long been interested in radio. They have a pretty robust internet radio operation already, so he may want to add a broadcast radio station to that., Howard: Well let's look at the loosening of restrictions on owning multiple television stations. Is this in any way going to be helping Sinclair Broadcasting as it tries to buy Tribune Media? Tribune, of course, being another big media outlet — and there's a merger pending there., Kennedy: It certainly will. If the merger had been approved but the old rule had stayed in effect, the new super Sinclair would have had to divest itself of a number of TV stations in order to stay under the cap in these individual markets. As it stands, as I understand it, they would have to divest themselves of many fewer stations and they would end up owning more stations than they would otherwise., Howard: Well now that they're not going to be burdened by that, and if they are, in fact, allowed to have this merger go through, it would create the country's largest television group — access to nearly three quarters of U.S. households — 72 percent to be exact. In fact, one of their current stations is WJAR in Providence. Now some of the local stations that Sinclair has bought up have bristled at being required to carry content produced by the owners, which has a definite right-leaning bent, including carrying — nine times a week — commentary by a former Trump official, Boris Epshteyn., Now here's a clip where Epshteyn goes after the media:, (SOUND FROM THE CLIP), ""From the very start of the Trump presidency the press briefings have veered way off course. They've become much more theater than information gathering; theater in which, frankly, the press has often played the leading role."", Howard: Does it matter to you whether these commentaries are conservative or liberal? What do you make of it?, Kennedy: I don't care whether the commentary is right, left or center. I think that what's an issue here is that you have the big national chain forcing all of its local stations to carry exactly the same content on their local newscasts. This is not something that we've seen before in local television. They're pretty much free to do their own coverage of their own communities. And unfortunately, localism used to be the watchword of the FCC, and it doesn't seem that they really care about that anymore., Howard: OK, thanks for joining us., Kennedy: Thank you., Howard: That's Northeastern University journalism professor and WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

184,[Can Pot Help Alleviate The Opioid Crisis?],"[Opioid-related deaths in Massachusetts continue to decline in 2017, according to the latest data from the state. The reasons for the decline, as with any trend in public health, are likely to be complicated. But some advocates for marijuana legalization cite it as additional evidence that legalization results in fewer opioid deaths., Multiple studies have shown a correlation — states that have legalized marijuana have had lower rates of opioid deaths — but any scientist will tell you correlation alone doesn’t mean cause-and-effect. , We can’t say legal weed is responsible for the lower rates of death from opioid overdose, at least not without a lot more detailed study. But we can look at what the latest science and research tells us about the effect cannabis can have on the opioid problem., Kids are still warned of marijuana’s danger as a gateway drug, and drug war hawks like current Attorney General Jeff Sessions have suggested that legal pot will make the opioid problem worse. But Elizabeth Dost, a healthcare executive and longtime registered nurse here in Boston, says marijuana isn’t a gateway drug — it’s an ‘exit drug’ — patients can use it to get off opioid painkillers.   , One patient Dost said she recently encountered was a professional woman about 50-years-old who “had a myriad of health complications that included significant pain for which she took Percocet. And she was able to come off of her Percocet with use of cannabis.”, This is one of the ways advocates say medical marijuana could help with the opioid problem — patients using cannabis instead of opioid drugs., Amanda Reiman works for Flow Cana, a cannabis distribution company in California; as a lecturer at the University of California in Berkeley, she led a study that examined how patients there were using medical marijuana. They found that “about 76 percent of the medical cannabis population said they were using cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs.” Of those, 95 percent said “cannabis was a much better experience for them in managing their pain and their symptoms than opiates or other medications.”,  Still, Reiman says it’s a leap to say legal pot is responsible for the overall decline in opioid overdose deaths. , “We have people saying, ‘Yes, cannabis has helped me. I used to be on all of these opiates and now I'm not. And I was addicted to this, and now I'm not,’"" she said. ""Those anecdotes are very moving but they're also not causation.”, Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neurologist and head of Mt. Sinai’s addiction center in New York, says we need a lot more research about marijuana’s relationship to opioid addiction. , “There clearly [are] some benefits for different cannabinoids and even some marijuana strains, perhaps, but those are not conclusive as yet,” said Hurd, who leads a multi-disciplinary team of scientists studying addiction. , But Hurd says one compound in some strains of cannabis has shown particular promise: cannabidiol, or CBD., “That has been shown to have in one way even neuroprotective effects, decreasing anxiety,” Hurd said. “And it doesn't have any rewarding properties there's no hedonic effects associated with using cannabidiol.”, Meaning CBD doesn’t get you high., “Some of our own studies have shown that it may be potentially beneficial in decreasing craving in heroin abuse,” Hurd said., Aside from its potential in decreasing craving for opioid addicts, Amanda Reiman says that medical marijuana can be as effective as a first-line treatment for opioid withdrawal., “We know that it helps with nausea,” she said. “We know that it helps with pain. We know that it can have an impact on muscle seizures and other types of tremors. So, I think that cannabis is a very suitable medication to help people move through that withdrawal phase.”, But Dost says that in Massachusetts, it’s not easy for patients to figure out what might work for them., “They really are not utilizing nurses in dispensaries to help the dispensary and to help walk patients through this event of using cannabis,” Dost said., In Massachusetts, you need to get a referral from a qualified doctor to get medical marijuana, but you don’t get a prescription — no script from a doctor telling you what strain of cannabis to take, how to take it, what dosage, or how often., “Without rigorous scientific studies conducted, we're never going to get there,” she said., Even if doctors and nurses get more involved, Hurd said they still lack the information they need to effectively prescribe the drug., “The irony of it, the catch-22 of this whole situation, is that people have voted and now we have so-called medical marijuana,” Hurd said. “And people are consuming these drugs. Yet still the federal regulations for research to be conducted with marijuana which is considered a schedule one drug. [That has] limited the amount and the type of research that can be done.”, Advocates like Dost are working to change some of the rules around medical marijuana in Massachusetts to get nurse practitioners more involved, but she’s worried the needs of medical marijuana patients will be forgotten now that recreational pot has been legalized., Arun Rath is the host of WGBH News' All Things Considered. ]"

191,[Gov. Charlie Baker Reviews Bilingual Education Bill],"[Barbara Howard: Gov. Charlie Baker is reviewing a bill that would effectively repeal a 15-year-old law that essentially banned bilingual education for immigrants in public schools. The repeal of those limitations was passed by the Massachusetts House and Senate yesterday. If signed into law by Baker, school districts would then be freed up to consider optional teaching methods. WGBH Radio's education reporter Bianca Vazquez-Toness has been following the bill closely and is with us in the studio. Thanks for coming in., Vazquez-Toness: Thanks for having me., Howard: So how are immigrant students being taught right now?, Vazquez-Toness: The majority of immigrant students are immersed in English from the get-go. They might be given a special English class that's catered to them at the beginning of their schooling, but then they're put in mainstream classes that are all in English., Howard: What's wrong with that? Why would people be opposed to that?, Vazquez-Toness: Well, school districts — some school districts — and some advocates for immigrants say that that's really restrictive. It doesn't give teachers enough options to cater education to kids. They also say that if you look at research, and the research does bear out, that immigrant students do as well if not better in bilingual education than they do in English-only education., Howard: So what does a new bill do? How is it different?, Vazquez-Toness: The new bill would give districts more options. They could keep doing what they're doing. That's [the] all English approach. Or they could teach students in their core subjects — math and science and history — in their native language, while also teaching them more and more English eventually moving them into all English classes., Howard: So the core subjects like history, you kind of have to understand the concept. So if you're not learning it in your native language, you can fall behind?, Vazquez-Toness: That's the point. And that's what people say is happening when kids are learning in all English. The argument is — and researchers say that this is true — that if you don't know English and you are in a math class or a science class or history class, you are not going to get those concepts as well as you would if you knew English., Howard: OK, so you can do it the way we've been doing it, do it this new way, or the third option. There's another option?, Vazquez-Toness: The third option, which has always existed, which is called dual-language, dual- immersion programs, which is where say you know half the kids speak Spanish and half the kids speak English and they learn together — half the time in English and half the time in Spanish. Only about a dozen school districts right now in Massachusetts have those programs. And under this, maybe more would be adopted, too., Howard: OK. The bill also, what would it do for families?, Vazquez-Toness: This bill is interesting because it gives parents more power, more control to compel a district to change or add its programs. For instance, if 20 or more Haitian Creole speaking parents request that their kids be taught in Haitian Creole, the district has to respond within 90 days with the plan to address the request or if they deny it, they have to respond in writing and include their explanation., Howard: How many kids are we talking about?, Vazquez-Toness: This is 10 percent of the school population. Ten percent are considered English language learners. So, it's a big number., Howard: Well, OK thanks for joining us, Bianca., Vazquez-Toness: Thanks for having me., Howard: That's WGBH Radio's Bianca Vazquez-Toness.

193,[Bringing Football To Fenway],"[The steady roar of marching bands fills stadiums across the country as football teams take the field from September to November. This Veteran’s Day match-up is between the visiting University of Maine Black Bears and the University of Massachusetts Minutemen. , Everything about the afternoon is exactly how you’d imagine a college game day: the students and alumni huddled in the stands, the cheerleaders on the sidelines waving their pom poms, the bitterly cold air. Everything, that is, except the location — Fenway Park., This isn’t the first time football has been played in the shadow of the Green Monster. The Patriots actually played at Fenway for six seasons back in the 1960s. At the time, they were still the Boston Patriots. And, two years ago, Boston College played Notre Dame there.,  For three weeks this fall, the game is back as part of the Fenway Gridiron Series. Today, the field runs from home plate to center field. There’s no infield dirt. It’s been covered with grass, though the outline is still visible. , Getting the field ready falls to David Mellor, the senior director of grounds for the Boston Red Sox, and a crew of workers who start prepping weeks in advance., , Mellor and the crew bring in rolls of sod made of Kentucky bluegrass from a farm in New Jersey. They layer it over the infield dirt, home plate, pitcher's mound and the baseline, piece by piece, weeks before the first kickoff. , “Some rolls weigh up to a ton,"" Mellor said. ""They’re four feet wide. They’re heavy thick sod, so they should play well."" , It’s not just as simple as putting the sod over the field, though. The grounds crew has to make sure the sod is locked in but doesn't actually take root in the infield, so once it’s laid down, the crew walks over the sod, inch by inch. , , ""We top dress it to smooth it, we roll it,"" Mellor said. ""Every sod seam is walked just to make sure it plays well and it’s flat."", The crew spends hours making sure all the details of the field are right: the white yard lines, the mid-field logo, the words “Fenway Park” painted in the iconic Red Sox font in the end zones. , , Mellor compares it to yard work, just with a really big yard., The late novelist John Updike famously called Fenway a ""lyric little bandbox” of a ballpark. That’s because Fenway’s sharp angles and short left field make it a bizarre place to play baseball — much less football.   Even though it takes a lot of heavy lifting for Mellor and his crew to fit the gridiron inside the cozy confines of Fenway, the field feels like a throwback to the days before artificial turf took over football and other sports., “I believe there was a player in the '70s, Richie Allen, who said, 'If a horse can't eat it,' he didn't want to play on it,"" Mellor said. ""And so, healthy, actively growing grass is a great playing surface.”, After UMass' 44-31 win over Maine, UMass cornerback and Warwick, Rhode Island native Lee Moses said playing football at Fenway made him pause, at least for a moment. , ""When I came out for pre-game warm ups and stuff, I had to stop and look around … you kind of just had to go out and be like, ‘Wow, this is amazing,'"" he said. ""And then [it's] right back to football."", The Red Sox haven’t announced whether the game will return to their classic ballpark next year, but UConn will host Boston College there Friday night and there will be three high school games next week.  , Esteban is the Production Assistant for On Campus, WGBH’s Higher Education Desk.

196,[The Gangs Of Nantucket: Fear And Politics],"[This article is part four of a four-part series titled ""The Gangs of Nantucket."" Part one is available here. Part two is available here, and part three is available here., With police in dress uniforms as a backdrop, President Trump in July delivered a blood and guts speech in Brentwood, New York, that left little doubt about how he felt about MS-13, a Central American gang that has become one of the administration’s prime examples of what Trump calls out-of-control immigration. There on Long Island, gang members have been arrested for murder and other crimes., “MS-13 is particularly violent,” Trump said. “They like to knife ‘em and cut ‘em and let them die slowly because that way, it's more painful and they enjoy watching that much more. These are animals.”, Conservative politicians across the country in recent election campaigns used the specter of MS-13 and the rival 18th Street gang to whip up support and, some say, to get rid of thousands of unaccompanied youth from Central America who’ve come here over the past few years — including to the island of Nantucket. Henry Lemus Calderon was one of them. He had imagined walking across the stage of Nantucket High School with the rest of the class of 2017. , “I want to have my diploma,” he said. , Instead, this 19-year-old Salvadoran is sitting in a high-level immigration detention ward in Bristol County. Calderon, 5-foot-10 and broad shouldered, said in halting English he was stereotyped at Nantucket High School as a gang member. His chains clattered as he spoke., , “When I went to the school, he [another student] said ‘Yo, that guy, he looks dangerous, he looks like [a bad boy]',” Calderon said. , A high school tough guy, perhaps, but Calderon never imagined he would become an example of what Trump calls “a vile criminal cartel.” Calderon’s lawyer, Zoila Gomez, said she sought to subpoena witnesses to prove that her client is not a gang member, something she has done in the past. , “The subpoenas that were filed by my office before the immigration court were all denied,” she said., Gomez has concluded that these days, immigration judges aren’t hearing it. “They are under more pressure to keep people in detention who otherwise would be eligible to be released on bond,"" she said., Though her client was arrested during the Obama era, Gomez believes that Calderon’s continued incarceration is explained by new immigration policies targeting unaccompanied minors like him. She says the Trump administration is promoting the notion that many of these youths are gang members or potential recruits, “to convince the country that we have to get rid of a lot of these young men that come here.”, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said as much at Boston’s Federal Courthouse. Sessions was speaking to reporters at the U.S. District Court there in September.  , “We're now working with the Department of Homeland Security to examine the unaccompanied minor issue and the exploitation of that problem by gang members who come to this country as wolves in sheep's clothing,” Sessions said., The exact number is not clear, but between 2014 and 2016, more than a dozen unaccompanied teenagers arrived in Nantucket to live with aunts, uncles and other sponsors. Matthew Etre, until recently, directed ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations unit in New England. He says many are ripe for the taking. , , “MS-13 is preying upon the unaccompanied minors and trying to recruit them into gang membership,” Etre said. “And that creates a problem for our communities, because you now have youth that are coming into our communities that are in school at times and are gang members at the same time. So that brings on a new dynamic for us within the community."", Operation Community Shield, in place since 2005, was ICE’s response to this perceived danger. The arrests on Nantucket are part of that continuing nationwide effort to rid the country of Central American gangs., MS-13 and its main rival, 18th street gang, represent real threats and have for a while, says Michael Paarlberg, a political scientist at Virginia Commonwealth University who is an expert on El Salvador and Central American gangs in the U.S. But Paarlberg says the rhetoric from the Trump administration and the accelerated crackdown on gangs have political overtones., “I think it's a lot of fear mongering, and it's greatly exaggerated,” Paarlberg said., Paarlberg describes what he is hearing from the Trump administration as “hyperbolic hysteria.”, “It's really a tiny proportion of the overall world of gangs and organized crime in the U.S., yet because they are perceived as an alien threat from another country and in a climate in which immigration is a very hot button issue, it is an effective way to garner votes,” he added., But Shawn Neadeuar, a spokesman for ICE, insists that the ongoing crackdown on gangs is about public safety and law, not politics. , “The president, in the Jan. 25 executive order, explicitly stated immigration enforcement goals. If you are in this country breaking the law, you can be subject to enforcement,” Neudauer said. “So while we may prioritize M-S 13 gang members, we're not going to ignore people who have committed very few or no crimes whatsoever but are still here in this country illegally.”, Some on Nantucket fear this policy will scare immigrant workers off the island. Indeed, since WGBH News began researching this story six months ago, several Salvadoran families have left Nantucket, including one longtime resident, Isidro Lemus, who is Henry Calderon’s uncle. He crossed the border into Canada several weeks ago, and some people on the island believe many more could follow., Henry Calderon’s father, Jose Aristides Lemus, finds it sadly ironic that the gang his immigrant son is accused of belonging to originated in this country., Sitting in the living room of his brother’s home on Nantucket, Aristides Lemus pats his robust stomach like a drum to show the scars where three bullets entered him during El Salvador’s civil war. The bloody conflict in the 1980s and a dictatorship that the U.S. supported militarily drove tens of thousands of refugees to Los Angeles. That’s where the rival MS-13 and 18th Street gangs were formed. Members of those gangs deported to El Salvador during the Clinton presidency have helped turn their home country's murder rate into one of the highest in the world., The possibility his son Henry will be forcibly returned to that is what keeps Aristides Lemus up at night., , This story was edited by Ken Cooper and Aaron Schacter., An earlier version of this story misstated a name in the piece and has since been updated., Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

199,"[As Tillerson Calls For Investigation Into The Rohingya Crisis, Two Refugees Arrive In Boston]","[This is the first story in a WGBH News series following two Rohingya refugees as they settle in Boston. The second story is also available online. , Today, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stopped off in Myanmar and pledged support for the country's Muslim-minority called the Rohingya., The Buddhist-majority country — also known as Burma — has come under international pressure for its treatment of the group. In the name of putting down a Muslim rebellion, the army has waged a sweeping military campaign in the Rakhine region. They've been accused of burning villages and raping Rohinyga women., This has prompted more than half a million Rohingya refugees to flee for neighboring Bangladesh. And just last week, two Rohingya refugees arrived in Boston., Less than 12 hours after Muhammad Anwar and Hussein Muhammad landed at Logan Airport, they are sitting on folding chairs in their sparsely furnished Dorchester apartment. Across the table is their case worker, Rahmatullah Aka., Pulling out his cell phone, Aka dials a translator to help him communicate with Anwar and Muhammad., “I put it on loud speaker. They are listening,” he says, placing the phone in the middle of the table. But it doesn’t take long to realize there’s a problem. The translator speaks the wrong language: Burmese, not Rohingya., Aka is himself a refugee, having arrived two years ago from Afghanistan, and, luckily, he happens to speak Urdu. “Okay, do you speak Urdu?” he asks, thinking quickly. “Can I speak with you in Urdu?”, Urdu seems to work, so they get started. Aka explains everything in the third-floor apartment these two men will share with four other refugees, who are all Muslim men. They pause at the front entrance, where Aka shows them how to unlock the door to their new home., It’s been a long journey to get here. Both men grew up in Myanmar but in distant villages: 19-year-old Anwar was with his family, including several brothers, and 30-year-old Muhammad was married and a rice farmer., Muhammad says he faced constant persecution: beatings, bribes, and the regular threat of being hauled off to jail without explanation. For decades, the Rohingya have been denied citizenship and basic rights in Myanmar., And, Muhammad says, several times in the past few years his villages has been consumed by violence. They were attacked, he says, by Myanmar's military, who indiscriminately killed community members. Muhammad particularly remembers seeing people — even children — being thrown alive into fires., Both Anwar and Muhammad fled by boat in 2015 without their families. When the men eventually reached Indonesia, they shared a room in a refugee camp for a few years., “It’s a terrible, terrible world tragedy right now,” said Jeff Thielman. He is the CEO of the International Institute of New England, the group resettling Anwar and Muhammad. “What’s going on in Myanmar right now is just like Rwanda. It's practically a genocide ... We should do something about it as a country.”, Several European countries and a U.N. official have called the situation ""ethnic cleansing."" But, on his brief five-hour visit to Myanmar, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson wouldn't go that far., “Whether it meets all the criteria for ethnic cleansing, we continue to evaluate that ourselves,"" he said at a press conference., Tillerson called for an independent investigation. But Nazda Alam of Weston isn't waiting for an investigation., “It feels like it is our human consciousness and responsibility to help,” she said., Alam has been in the U.S. for more than three decades. She's originally from Bangladesh, which is hosting hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees, and she worries the international outcry has been muted because of their religion., ""A lot of time you will see the headline: Rohingya Muslim, Rohingya Muslim. But we don't want to see that this is a human rights issue — it's not a Muslim issue,"" Alam said., She’s teamed up with others to send doctors and supplies to the refugee camps. She’s also focused on political action, including pushing federal legislation that would impose sanctions on certain officials in Myanmar and limit the U.S. from military cooperation with the country’s army, among other things., As for Muhammad Anwar and Hussein Muhammad, they’re busy with the logistics of starting their lives in America. They’re buying cell phones and signing up for emergency food assistance. But they are also thinking about the future, including the possibility of one day bringing their families over and getting citizenship — something they were denied in Myanmar. , Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

201,[EJ Dionne Is Hopeful For America's Future After Trump],"[E.J. Dionne wants to remind everyone: there is a future after Trump., In his new book, ""One Nation After Trump: A Guide For The Perplexed, The Disillusioned, The Desperate, and the Not-Yet-Deported,"" Dionne (along with co-authors Thomas E. Mann and Norman J. Ornstein) assesses the 2016 election and looks ahead to ways anti-Trump Republicans and Democrats can find common ground., Dionne joined Boston Public Radio to discuss the book and what he believes is next for American politics. A partial transcript follows., MARGERY EAGAN: You talk about [Trump's election] as the culmination of a quite long history of the Republican Party. Tell us about that., E.J. DIONNE: We argue in the book that the Republican Party has been radicalizing for 20 to 25 years. We quote John F. Kennedy's great line out of his Inaugural Address: ""He who foolishly rides to power on the back of the tiger ends up inside."" The Republican establishment ended up inside the tiger they were riding. When Donald Trump was being a birther and saying President Obama had not been born in the U.S., a lot of Republicans went along. Even John Boehner, who said, ""Well, I don't believe that,"" was asked, ""Well, do you disown it?"" and he said, ""Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion."" So on those grounds, you saw it., On immigration, the Republicans had always supported immigration reform. George W. Bush tried to get it through Congress. Ronald Reagan signed it into law. Yet as time went on, the party more and more cozied up to nativist feeling in the country ... Then there was just a general attitude toward the opposition. When President Obama was in office, [the Republicans] were determined to stop everything. They were playing this radical game, and along came Donald Trump who said, ""Well, I'm the real thing. Don't vote for these Republican establishment candidates."" A lot of Republicans said, ""Yeah, that's what we've been hearing from these guys [and] they didn't deliver it."" Trump said he would, and he won the nomination., JIM BRAUDE: Enough people followed him under our electoral system to get him elected, but I'm sure you've seen the surveys recently ... They're loyal to the man, not the ideology such as it is. That's an accurate statement, is it not?, DIONNE: I'm glad you mentioned the electoral system because we have one chapter in this book on political reform, an it's worth noting the Electoral College has now gone haywire twice, relative to the popular vote. We talk about a lot of other things like gerrymandering ... On Trump, I think we should not write off all the people who voted for him as completely indifferent to the news. If you look at his vote, he got 46 point something percent. He's down to somewhere between 33 percent and 38 percent in his approval ratings. There are plenty of people who voted for Trump, whether because they were mad in general [or] didn't like Clinton — which was a significant piece of his support — who nonetheless don't like the way he's been president., BRAUDE:  But they don't like the Democrats either ... Their numbers are as bad as Donald Trump's are, aren't they?, DIONNE: No, they're not, actually. And if you look at the results of the elections last Tuesday ... in almost every jurisdiction in the country, from Maine to Connecticut to Virginia to New Jersey all the way down to Georgia across to Washington state, Democrats won everything, and it was all the way down to the local level. A lot of people were voting Democratic for town councils because they were mad at Donald Trump. , BRAUDE: I always wonder, despite what exit polls say, did people give Democrats a huge victory because of the policies they espoused or because they were not Donald Trump?, DIONNE: Oh, I think in significant part because they were not Donald Trump. One of the reasons we wrote this book ... is [to give] a series of suggestions about where we need to go if we're going to move past Trump., On the other hand, if you take the Affordable Care Act, [there's] this notion that Democrats have been powerless. You wouldn't have defeated the effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act if Democrats from Bernie Sanders to Joe Manchin hadn't stuck together, and if large numbers of Americans hadn't shown up at all these town halls and said, ""Wait a minute, this thing is better than we thought."" I've ascribed a lot to the political philosopher Joni Mitchell: ""You don't know what you've got til it's gone."" That's what happened to the Affordable Care Act. People suddenly focused and said, ""My God, if we lose this, we lose some real benefits."" And they said, ""We don't want this repealed."", Click the audio player above to hear more from E.J. Dionne.

He testified during his confirmation hearing that he’d had no contact with the Russians during the campaign, but he had actually met twice with the Russian ambassador. He also testified last month that Trump surrogates hadn’t had contact with the Russians, until news reports revealed Carter Paige and George Papadopoulos had., For Kayyem, the explanation for Sessions’ failure to recall the details is simple:, “I think the truth is that he was not honest under oath,” she said. “He’s choosing between perjury and what probably is underneath it.”, National security expert Juliette Kayyem joins us every week.

203,[Citizen Scientists Take The Pulse Of The Arnold Arboretum's Trees],"[Today's focus tree is the sugar maple, and Suzanne Mrozak is ready. In her bag is a jumble of maple candies and cookies. In her ears dangles a pair of red maple leaf earrings — obviously., Standing in front of Mrozak is a handful of volunteers jotting down notes. Leaf color? They look up at the enormous canopy of the tree. Yes. Fruit drop? They look down at the brown seeds littering the ground. Yes., They're members of a group called the Tree Spotters, a program that trains volunteers to be citizen scientists at the Arnold Arboretum. The Tree Spotters monitor the life cycles of trees, noting when they bud, grow leaves and turn colors. The data they collect is then used by scientists at the arboretum and all over the country to study everything from seasonal allergies to how climate change may be affecting New England's trees., They know how to have fun, too. Mrozak, a former Genzyme employee who is now the program’s volunteer coordinator, bubbles with energy as she pulls cider out of her bag. “I like making things happen,” she said, and if you glance at the peppy newsletter she puts together — called, naturally, “Spot On!” — you get an idea of what she’s talking about. There are calls for book clubs and links to botany-themed coloring books. Every year they have a holiday potluck and a July cookout., , Next to Mrozak is Catherine Chamberlain, a scientist at the arboretum who studies late freezing events, or cold snaps in the spring that can wipe out the buds of plants. While her dog, Kylie, waits patiently at her side, she explains to the volunteers that sugar maples — the fiery red icons of New England autumns — are finicky trees, sensitive to competition from other plants, shade and the stresses of urban environments., Scientists like her are worried about the impact that warmer winters and shifting springs may have on them and other trees., ""There's all sorts of things that could happen,"" Chamberlain said, ticking off a few examples., It’s possible that trees may be able to adapt to shifting seasons (spring, for instance, came three weeks early in some areas of the U.S. this year) but their pollinators may not. Trees could start dropping seeds earlier in the fall or even late in the summer, before squirrels are ready to collect them. That could spell trouble later in the season., Another scenario: as warm temperatures come earlier in the spring, trees may start to bud earlier — only for those buds to freeze when the last frost arrives., “We might see more of these intense spring freezing events that could really hurt the trees,” Chamberlain said., This is where she turns to the Tree Spotter data., ""The information our Tree Spotters collect is very useful,"" Chamberlain explained. ""I can already look back the last couple years and see how each year has changed, and how these different temperatures in the spring have affected that time frame."", , The Tree Spotters record data with an online platform called “Nature’s Notebook” which is run by the National Phenology Network (phenology is the scientific term for how seasonal changes affect living things). The platform, which anyone can use and add observations to, can be used to track trees or other plants as well as animals. Scientists can then access the database for their projects — recent examples include a study on how climate change is impacting bird migration and one on how warming temperatures may lead to the growth of more ragweed, which could increase seasonal allergies and asthma in humans.  , Volunteer Doris Corbo pulls up the Nature’s Notebook app on her phone and demonstrates how easy it is to record observations. (Volunteers can also print datasheets from the website and enter the data online later.) Corbo lives nearby and her children learned to walk and ride their bikes here, so the arboretum is a special place for her. But she was also interested in getting involved in climate change action close to home., “That was what was attractive to me — just, as an average citizen, being able to make a contribution towards something larger than yourself,” she said., Chamberlain says that’s what has been drawing a lot of people to citizen science programs these days., “You hear about all these things that are happening in the world. Lots of shifts are happening to our habitats,” she said. “That’s why people are coming in — to learn about how climate change is impacting them."", Volunteer Evie Weinstein-Park learned about the Tree Spotters on a walk through the Arboretum with friends. She’s a fourth grade teacher and hopes to introduce Tree Spotting to her students., “The kids are always in a rush, and we rush them a lot,” she said. “I feel like looking at something really long and hard, the more you look the more you see. It’s a good activity for kids nowadays, maybe any day, but especially now when everybody goes so fast.”, “I think sometimes we lose touch with the outside world,” Weinstein-Park continued. “It just feels so good to be outside on a day like this, to really be looking and noticing. It’s miraculous.”, Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

Speaking before the House Judiciary Committee, he again said he did not have improper conversations with Russians and has no knowledge that any Trump campaign official colluded with the Kremlin.

Retired Federal Judge Nancy Gertner, now a senior lecturer at Harvard Law School, and Mark Strand, president of the Congressional Institute and a current fellow at Harvard’s Institute of Politics, joined Jim Braude to discuss that and Donald Trump Jr.’s campaign correspondence with WikiLeaks., For most people, TV, movies and art in general are an escape from the ugly realities of the real world.

205,[The Curious Sport Of Curling Comes to Boston's North End ],"[I'm inside a chilly ice rink in Boston's North End on a Sunday night. There is nobody out on the ice. No figure skaters. No hockey game. But I'm still pretty excited. Paul Aronofsky is sliding a key into a hefty padlock to throw open a hand-made crate. And there are few things more thrilling for a curiosity seeker than when the contents of a locked box are revealed. So what's inside? , ""We’ve got some curling stones,"" said Aronofsky, who is Vice President of the brand new North End Curling Club., ""These are about 42 pounds each, made from granite that comes from Scotland,"" he explained., ""Isn't there granite in New Hampshire?"" I countered. ""Isn’t that the Granite State? We gotta get it all the way from Scotland?"", ""They all come from this one region in Scotland,"" he said. ""I’m not really sure why."", Maybe it’s because Scotland is where the sport of curling — that shuffleboard-on-ice game that you see every four years during the winter Olympics — was invented. In the 1500s, no less. It’s a fairly popular sport there — as it is in Canada. But here in the USA it’s remained decidedly niche. Not for long, if Aronofsky and Greg Riehle, president of the club, have their way., ""We would like to try and really make it more of a community thing,"" said Riehle. ""It’s a great sport. Anybody can play it no matter how young, how old, and it’s really easy to get into. Nobody takes themselves too seriously when they’re curling so it’s a lot of fun."", Riehle and Aronofsky first came across the sport — where those granite stones are slid 150 feet along the ice toward a target, while teammates furiously brush the ice to alter the speed — the way most Americans do., ""On TV at the winter Olympics,"" said Riehle. ""I saw it on the Olympics, and was just like 'this is just the weirdest coolest thing ever,'"" added Aronofsky., But to actually try their hand at it, they had to travel miles outside of Boston, where they both live. There’s places on the South Shore. Broomstones Curling Club has been around for decades, but they’re in Wayland. Then there’s Blackstone Valley Curling Club in Hopedale., ""And we both just fell in love with it and decided to curl down there and up in Nashua as well, but those are really the two closest places,"" said Aronofsky. ""So it’s exciting to see something right here in the heart of Boston."", What they hope will become the heart of curling in Boston is Steriti Memorial Rink in the North End., ""I live right around the corner,"" said Riehle. ""And Steriti rink was just sitting here every Sunday night just open and waiting for curling."", And so the work began: Booking regular ice time, leasing dozens of stones and other equipment, getting insurance – and other interested folks on board., And if Riehle and Aronofsky’s quest to inch curling from a sporting curiosity toward something more commonplace here in Boston sounds Quixotic, don’t be so quick to dismiss it., ""I think there really is a pent-up demand for curling in the Boston area,"" said Kim Nawyn, Director of Growth and Development for USA Curling, the national body for the sport. Since curling debuted in the 1998 winter games, USA Curling has seen its ranks swell by more than 75 percent. And Nawyn says places like the Twin Cities in Minnesota and New England are target markets., ""We currently have 20,778 registered curlers,"" she said. ""They’re members of 175 different curling clubs in over 40 states in the nation."", Nawyn says that the sport sees a reliable surge of interest in Olympic years, and with the 2018 Winter Games in South Korea just around the corner, the North End Curling Club's timing couldn’t be better., ""We’ve got a couple events around that time that we’re really hoping to capture a lot of enthusiasm about the sport,"" said Riehle., The North End Curling Club is 15 strong right now, and they hope to get their numbers up to 32 in the coming months. But their ambitions don’t end there. They envision wheelchair curling nights and bonspiels — curling tournaments against other clubs., ""Later on, we might see if we can get a curling night at Fenway, partner with MIT to get some scientists or physicists to explain the physics of curling,"" said Aronofsky. ""There’s endless amounts of opportunity around here."", But first things first. Simply give folks a place to curl in the city. As far as Riehle is concerned, the rest will take care of itself., ""It’s a lot of fun,"" he said. ""We’ve seen it. If you get people on the ice throwing stones, then they really wanna come back and do it again."", You can get on the ice and throw stones for yourself, as the North End Curling Club holds their first “Learn to Curl” events, November 19 and 26. , What have you been curious about lately?

206,[Lawyers Group Claims Federal Immigration Officials Targeting State Courthouses ],"[Barbara Howard: Earlier this year, the highest court in Massachusetts ruled that local and state police cannot hold suspects based solely on pending immigration violations. Two months later, 50 undocumented immigrants were arrested across Massachusetts by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice cried foul saying that ICE was targeting Massachusetts in retaliation for that ruling. And now the Lawyers’ Committee has released a report they say shows that ICE is targeting state courts when it comes to arresting immigrants. Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal is the group's Executive Director, and he's with us on the line. Thank you for joining us., Espinoza-Madrigal: Thank you, Barbara., Howard: So how frequently are we seeing ICE taking people into custody at state courthouses?, Espinoza-Madrigal: We are seeing a disturbing spike. This is something that started after the election, and we had heard about it anecdotally from immigrants’ rights advocates on the ground, who had seen this type of enforcement activity in courtrooms and around courthouses., Howard: Is this happening more in courthouses in so-called sanctuary cities? You know, cities that have guidelines limiting how police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities or is it more broad?, Espinoza-Madrigal: This is broader. It is targeting courthouses across Massachusetts, we believe, in retaliation for recent court rulings and protocols that have been put into place to limit the arrest of individuals based solely on federal civil immigration detainers., Howard: When ICE comes and detains people at the state courthouses, are these the bad hombres that the president was talking about?, Espinoza-Madrigal: Absolutely not. What we are seeing is an enforcement regime that is sweeping up everybody. This broad enforcement activity goes beyond criminal offenders, and it includes many people with minor traffic infractions., Howard: There have been concerns raised about what kind of chill effect that this has on immigrants who are afraid to go to courthouses. Are you hearing that too?, Espinoza-Madrigal: This really scares people from being able to come forward as victims or witnesses of crimes. It prevents women who are victims of domestic abuse from coming forward to get a restraining order against their abusers. If people know that they will be detained by immigration at the courthouse steps, they will avoid the courthouses., Howard: Have judges weighed in about this?, Espinoza-Madrigal: In our report, we reference a number of judges who have raised serious concerns. Judges, from their perspective on the bench, are seeing how this is affecting the administration and access to justice., Howard: In your organization's report, you claim ICE is targeting Massachusetts courthouses in retaliation for a court decision that came down earlier this year and that limited police and other agencies from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. You say that this is a way for the federal authorities — ICE — to circumvent that state ruling?, Espinoza-Madrigal: Our state is being selected for this type of reckless enforcement because the federal government is concerned with the immigrant-friendly policies, decisions, and protocols that we have in place in Massachusetts., Howard: What evidence do you have of that?, Espinoza-Madrigal: The strongest evidence comes in the form of email communication back and forth among immigration officials. They reference the Lunn decision and other immigration protocols that we have in place., Howard: The Lunn decision being of course that earlier court decision that cuts off police cooperation with the federal authorities on this., Espinoza-Madrigal: Yes. We submitted a request for public records that disclosed a vast amount of information about the enforcement activities in Massachusetts courthouses. We have received e-mails from the federal government that shows back and forth discussion about immigrant-friendly rulings coming from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court., Howard: So you're saying that that's why our courthouses more than in other states are being targeted?, Espinoza-Madrigal: Absolutely., Howard: OK, thanks for joining us, Mr. Espinoza-Madrigalis., Espinoza-Madrigal: Thank you very much., Howard: That's Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal. He is the Executive Director for the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice. WGBH News did reach out to ICE. The agency did not comment on the claim of retaliation, but noted that it considers courthouses fair game when it comes to enforcement, saying that courthouses can provide immigration agents their best and safest opportunity to locate individuals that they are looking to arrest. , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

Doerr drove in over 100 runs six times in his career. ""In the field he was an outstanding defender at second base, combining with Johnny Pesky to form a terrific double-play combination. And beyond that, he was a remarkable teammate."", Doerr was dubbed the ""Silent Captain"" by his teammate and friend Ted Williams., ""Bobby was a guy that Ted regarded as a confidant,"" Edes said. ""When Ted was upset he would go for long walks with Bobby on the road and confide in him. And it seems like he had that impact on everyone on that ball club. Just someone who was universally respected."", Edes said other teammates called Doerr the nicest person they'd ever met., Doerr was the oldest living major league player prior to his passing., “There is something fitting about Bobby Doerr becoming the patriarch of baseball, outliving all of those he played with and against,” Red Sox President/CEO Sam Kennedy said in a written statement. “Bobby was a special player, to be sure, a Hall of Famer, but he also commanded universal respect from all those fortunate enough to have crossed his path. We celebrated his return every time he came back to us here at Fenway Park, and we now mourn his passing, grateful for the wonderful memories he left.”, Doerr joined the Red Sox in 1937 at only 19 years old, and played 14 seasons with the team. His record of six 100-RBI seasons remained unmatched by another second baseman for 25 years., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

211,[MBTA Officials Balk Over Lifting Ban On Alcohol Ads],"[	 
	MBTA officials grappled unsuccessfully on Monday over whether to approve a plan, put forward by MBTA management, to partially lift a ban on alcohol advertisements on T property. 
	 
	Many other transit agencies, including New York's MTA, ban alcohol ads; and the T was one of the last major transit systems to implement such a ban, in 2012. 
	 
	On Tuesday, MBTA management presented a proposal to partially lift those restrictions to the T's Fiscal and Management Control Board, appointed by Governor Charlie Baker in 2015 to oversee the agency as it struggles to reach better fiscal and operational health. 
	 
	The proposal, which T officials say would bring in an estimated $2.5 million in revenue next year,  would allow alcohol advertisements in most T stations, though not in roughly a dozen stations that see the most youth ridership. 
	 
	It would also allow the ads on billboards on MBTA property and on T-managed bus shelters. (Alcohol ads already appear, in fact, on Boston bus shelters, which are owned by the city, not the T). 
	 
	Alcohol ads would not be allowed in subway cars or on buses. 
	 
	But the Control Board, despite being generally disposed, as a body, toward private-sector answers, balked when asked to approve what MBTA management billed as a ""pilot"" lifting of the all-out ban.
	 
	After calling an initial vote, Board Chairman Joseph Aiello found himself unable to find a single ""second"" among the group. 
	 
	A subsequent vote on a slightly-altered plan, in which train ad ""wraps"" were taken off the table, received only two ""yes"" votes — from Aiello and board member Steve Poftak — and two ""no"" votes, from board members Monica Tibbits-Nutt and Brian Lang, the only member to voice something close to total opposition to lifting the ban. 
	 
	But all of the board's members appeared to be struggling, with each voicing concern even as most appeared inclined to pass some version of the plan.
	 
	But support seemed to melt away as fast as it began to solidify. 
	 
	At one point, the board considered an amended plan that would have removed in-station advertising — which, MBTA director of revenue Evan Rowe estimated, would also knock out about 80% of the anticipated revenue.
	 
	That revelation sunk the compromise plan quickly, with Tibbit-Nutt opining that passing such a limited lifting of the ban was ""setting it up to fail,"" — a remark which seemed to inspire Lang, who opposed lifting the ban altogether but was apparently intrigued by the idea of throwing his support behind a fatally-flawed compromise.
	 
	""It'll take out 80% of the [advertising] market?"" said Lang, ""I'll vote for it.""
	 
	The vote failed. The Board will likely take the matter up again at an upcoming meeting.

213,[The Gangs Of Nantucket: The Partnership],"[This article is part three of a four-part series titled ""The Gangs of Nantucket."" Part one is available here, part two is available here, and part four is available here., On the grounds of the Bristol County Jail in Dartmouth, Sheriff Thomas Hodgson took me on a tour of the immigration detention center built on his watch. , “This building, it's got two wings that are basically sort of open-dorm settings and with two rec yards on the back of each one,” he explained. , I was escorted into one of the wards for potential deportees, a low-security facility. Next door is a unit reserved for hard-core immigrants., “These are predominantly people who either have committed a crime or have had removal orders and didn't comply with the removal order,” Hodgson said., , Henry Lemus Calderon, 19, is incarcerated in this unit, and he can’t figure out why. Though in the country illegally, he was never arrested for any crime and never ordered removed, and he bristles at the notion of being considered hard-core. , “I feel bad because I am not a gang member,” he said., Gang member or not, how Calderon ended up in Bristol was the result of a closely coordinated, priority operation between federal and local law enforcement targeting suspected members of the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs on Nantucket.  , His name appeared on a 2015 police report with the handwritten notation “18th Street gang member” submitted by an officer attached to Nantucket High School. In recent years, Central American gang recruiters were kicked off the high school campus, a law enforcement source told WGBH News. Police were increasingly worried about gang activity on the island and were keeping tabs on suspected members. Lt. Angus MacVicar of the Nantucket Police says the note about Calderon was entered in a database and shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE., “And with that shared information, ICE and other outside agencies have the ability to take a look at what's happened here and make a determination on whether or not, maybe, someone's illegal or not legally here in the country and then they would take actions on their own,” said MacVicar. , But ICE is not entirely on its own when its agents land on Nantucket. MacVicar acknowledged that his officers assist with transport with ICE agents., ""Our job is to make arrests and identify persons, in this instance, that could possibly be part of a gang,"" he said. , Massachusetts has a reputation as a relative safe haven for undocumented immigrants, such that since 2016, dozens of Central American families have made their way from Texas — known for its harsh immigration policies — to the Bay State with the help of volunteers and sanctuary communities, including those associated with the Needham Area Immigration Task Force., But when it comes to suspected members of transnational gangs, especially MS-13 and 18th Street, many of these same municipalities cooperate closely with ICE, sharing information and coordinating operations.  And that’s what's happening on Nantucket.  , Local cooperation, explained ICE's Matthew Etre, is “really key to being successful in gang enforcement, because the local authorities are the practitioners in their communities. They know exactly where the trouble spots are, who the individuals are that are causing that trouble.”, Etre, until recently, directed Homeland Security Investigations for ICE in New England. He said that the Nantucket operations that nabbed Calderon and other accused gang members over the past year were not indiscriminate. , “We have targeted operations,"" Etre said. ""We identify where the individuals live ahead of time. We have surveillance and we try to take them into custody in the most safe and secure fashion, without creating a lot of issues within a particular neighborhood.”, , Some Salvadoran workers on the island, seeking to protect themselves and their community from extortion and potential violence, have cooperated — such as Isidro Lemus. , “I know how dangerous these guys are, so if I see a little movements of gang members, first thing I will do is I will report it to the police department,” Lemus said., His brother, Rodolfo, said ICE agents have continued to conduct raids on the island since the arrest of their nephew, Henry Lemus Calderon, in May of 2016. One took place recently, he said: “A couple months ago. They get a couple of kids, but these are no good kids. They are the gang members.”, The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts wants to be sure they are truly gang members. Kade Crockford, who heads the ACLU's Technology for Liberty Program, accuses ICE, under the guise of a crackdown on transnational street gangs, of scooping up innocent young men. She calls it “a school-to-deportation pipeline.” The ACLU is pursuing a case in East Boston similar to Calderon’s., “Huge similarities!” exclaimed Crockford. “In East Boston, a school resource officer witnessed a fight and wrote in the police report about not only the students who were directly involved in the fight, but also about some of the students who were standing nearby, using extremely problematic generalizations. [He] categorized one young man, who happened to be just standing near there, as a gang member.”  , As with the crackdown on Nantucket, Crockford says that information was shared with ICE., “This young man turns out to have been undocumented, and was — based on that information — seized and put into deportation proceedings because of this Boston police policy that allows the BPD to share that type of information with the federal government, even absent any evidence of wrongdoing,” she said., But ICE spokesman Shawn Neudauer argued that being in the country without papers is wrongdoing enough, and acknowledged that the fears of the undocumented are well-founded., “We might arrest someone who we’ve encountered while we’re looking for another person. While we may prioritize an MS-13 gang member, we’re not going to ignore people who have committed very few or no crimes whatsoever, but are still in this country illegally,” Neudauer said., That practice worries undocumented immigrants on Nantucket and across the state. Rodolfo Lemus, for one, is rethinking his family’s cooperation with Nantucket police because of the coordinated ICE operation that landed his nephew in detention. Lemus, a U.S. citizen, says his undocumented friends on the island — janitors, painters, carpenters and other workers — have also become less willing to cooperate with police., “Before, ICE, when they come here, they are looking for one guy,"" Lemus said. ""He’s a bad guy, you know. ICE said, 'Don’t worry, they're coming only for one guy.' And now, it’s changed everything."", This story was edited by Aaron Schachter and Ken Cooper. , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

215,[The Gangs of Nantucket: The Story Of Henry Lemus Calderon],"[This article is part two of a four-part series titled ""The Gangs of Nantucket."" Part one is available here. Part three is available here., Henry Lemus Calderon was, by his own admission, not a choir boy, even though he sang in one. He attended services at Faro de Luz church in Nantucket where the Rev. Rigoberto Lemus presides. Lemus — a common Salvadoran name on Nantucket and no relation to Henry — said Calderon spent a lot of time behind church doors., , “We'd have a service Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday, and he always come those days. He always [volunteered] to open the door, receive the brothers and sisters. And he’s a good person,” said Rev. Lemus., Calderon’s family said he fled El Salvador after 18th Street gang members demanded monthly payments in exchange for his life. His brother-in-law was murdered in 2012 under circumstances that are not entirely clear, but the family was taking no chances. Calderon crossed the U.S.-Mexico border on foot in early 2014 to escape gang violence as thousands of other unaccompanied minors did. The Obama administration allowed some to stay if they had a sponsor. Calderon’s uncle, Rodolfo Lemus, lives on Nantucket, and within a short while the teen was enrolled at Nantucket High School., By all accounts, Calderon was a good student and excelled in algebra. “And he won excellence awards in his first few months of being here. And he barely spoke English, and he was already doing so well in school,” Jocelyn Ramirez, his cousin, said., Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents scooped up Henry Lemus Calderon last year during an anti-gang operation on Nantucket, and he now sits in a detention center awaiting possible deportation to El Salvador. Calderon supporters say ICE is trumping up charges and using the threat of gangs to sweep up undocumented young men from Central America. ICE already knew he was in the country and knew exactly where he lived. , But a year after arriving in Nantucket, a police report written by a school resource officer (SRO) sketched a very different portrait of Calderon. Handwritten notations on the report tagged him as a member of the notorious 18th Street gang. He was accused of threatening to beat up another student, a self-identified member of MS-13. Calderon was also alleged to have marked the school bathroom with the words: La Mara nunca muere, which means, ""The gang never dies."" But Zoila Gomez, Calderon’s attorney, said this and other conclusions reached by the school were based on a limited understanding of what determines gang membership., “There are certain things you have to do,"" Gomez said. ""There's certain things that they expect you to go through to become a member in order to be recognized and respected as a so-called member of a gang."", Gomez points out that Calderon was never arrested for any crime on Nantucket. And she said her client neither dresses like a gang member nor has gang tattoos. But Chris Cronin, who heads up ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations program in New England, said traditional gang markers have changed., “In the past there would be tattoos that, you know, were overt and everybody could see them if somebody was wearing a T-shirt,"" he said. , , Cronin said Central American gangs — including those in Nantucket — have resorted to more subtle ways of demonstrating membership. “So, it is challenging identifying folks that are part of gangs in today's world,"" he said., , But what happens when some identify themselves as gang members, as several young men at Nantucket High School apparently did? Lt. Angus MacVicar of the Nantucket police says it's simple: “If they're going to go ahead and identify themselves, then we're going to treat them as that.”, That is problematic, said attorney Lisa Thurau, who leads Strategies for Youth, which focuses on improving police-youth relations. She says by that example, what might ordinarily be written off as teenage bravado is being taken to a whole different level by local law enforcement, with life-altering consequences.       , “On Nantucket, you have a perfect storm of school resource officers having to address normative behaviors of youth intersecting with Homeland Security investigations, which has the agenda of trying to rid this country of people they see [as] undesirable, and it appears that the lines aren’t clear about what level of proof is necessary,"" Thurau said. , Nantucket police vehemently deny any suggestion that its officers engage in ethnic profiling. But one resident, Fernando Ramos, said that undocumented Salvadoran youth are painted with broader brush strokes than other students at the high school. Ramos, a U.S. citizen, and Calderon ate lunch together in the cafeteria. Ramos is convinced that the gang label attached to Calderon is based in part on observing Central Americans hanging out together. , “So many white people are with their white groups and Hispanics with the Hispanics, you know, so in his case, he didn't speak any English. And he straight out came from El Salvador,” Ramos said. “So obviously, kids are going to see him as different. So he sees the first person that he knows. Obviously, they speak Spanish.”, Several local residents, including a teacher and an artist, filed affidavits with the federal immigration court in Boston on behalf of Calderon. Nantucket resident Daniel Gault, a successful property manager, also vouched for him., “We were putting in a generator and we had to dig about a 30-foot trench. And so, I brought him and his buddy, and the two of them came along and they put their heads down and worked,” Gault said. ""You know, I've hired my neighbor. He's a local white kid and he's a terrible worker."", , Gault said he was shocked to hear that Calderon was taken away by ICE in May 2016. He’s being held in a section of the Bristol County Jail immigration wing reserved for hard-core members of MS-13 and 18th Street. Calderon’s uncle and guardian, Isidro Lemus, worries about his safety., “He got involved in a fight with a gang member the other day because they say that he didn't want to go with them outside and everything, talk to them,"" Isidro Lemus said. ""And Henry was like, ‘Listen, I'm not part of this whole thing. I'm here because they're accusing me of being with you guys.’ So he’s like, 'No way I'm going to get involved. I’d rather die before I do something stupid like that.'” , But Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who runs the Bristol County Jail, takes ICE’s word that Calderon is a gang member and a threat to the residents of Nantucket, and that’s why he’s locked up where he is., “It wouldn't make sense to put somebody in a situation like that where they would get targeted if they really weren't part of a gang,” Hodgson said., Calderon’s supporters, however, insist that he has been caught up in a federal crackdown on gangs. Here in Massachusetts, that ICE dragnet is being aided by Nantucket police and other local departments.  , This story was edited by Aaron Schachter and Ken Cooper. , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

That's likely good news for about three thousand workers at G.E.'s Aviation facility in Lynn who design, manufacture and assemble jet engines., ""Right now, 300,000 people, as we're here, are in the sky, sitting in planes powered by G.E. engines,"" CEO John Flannery told employees Monday. ""That's the size of the city of Pittsburgh,"", A company spokesman said the new cutbacks will not change or impact workers in Lynn., An aerospace report shows G.E. Aviation was the industry’s most profitable company in 2016, making more than $6 billion. , The president of the Lynn aviation facility’s union tells WGBH News that they’ve hired more than 200 people in the last year, and they’re expecting more investment in machines and training going forward., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
217,[What's Happening With General Electric?],"[Barbara Howard: What is going on at General Electric? The Boston-based company seems to be struggling — its stock on a long downward trend, and now an announcement from G.E.'s CEO that the company is reducing the quarterly dividend to its shareholders, and cutting some jobs. This following news earlier this year that G.E. is delaying completion of construction on its new world headquarters in Boston. With us on the line to explain what is happening with G.E. and what it means for Massachusetts is Jon Chesto. He covers business for The Boston Globe. He is at G.E.’s investor meeting in New York City. Thanks for joining us, Jon., Chesto: Sure. Thanks for having me., Howard: Well, first let's look at the local impact here in Boston. Much was made of the move of the corporate headquarters from Connecticut to Boston. What's the status of that?, Chesto: They are delaying the completion of the headquarters by two years, but they are still sticking with that plan. It's a $200 million project, and they say they're standing by it., Howard: OK. Now there's also talk of spinning off at least the lighting division now. That dates back to Thomas Edison's time. What's with that?, Chesto: Well there's two things. There's G.E. lighting, which does have its roots in the days of Thomas Edison, and G.E. is selling that off. There's also a group called Current, which focuses on I guess what you'd call smart lighting and energy efficiency and energy management solutions. That business is two years old, and it's based in Boston. They've decided that that business is too small and not really core to the company's efforts. So they're selling that off or divesting it., Howard: OK, so it's about 50 people in Boston working near South Station, right?, Chesto: Yeah, they're at the WeWork office near South Station., Howard: And now they're focusing on some key industries. Where are they keeping their investments?, Chesto: Well G.E. has decided under John Flannery that it's going to focus on three main business lines: aviation — and in Lynn, of course, we have a very large aviation factory; healthcare — and we have a decent sized portion of that business in the MetroWest area — and also power and energy., Howard:  And we also have, of course, 250 people you've written about in the temporary headquarters on Farnsworth's Street, which opened last year when they decided to move from Connecticut to here. Any more idea about any additional layoffs in the Boston area or in Massachusetts?, Chesto: You know, they've reduced their corporate headcount by 25 percent, but that's a global number. In Boston, there's been very minimal reduction. You know, they’ve cut a few jobs. They've added a few jobs. It's staying stable around 250. They have a tax break plan with the city of Boston to get to 800 jobs in the next six, seven years. And in return, they get $25 million off their taxes over a 20 year period. They still have a lot of time to get to that 800 job threshold. I don't see a very large increase in other locations in Massachusetts. But I think you will see the Boston headquarters count grow over time, it might not happen as quickly as they originally planned, but I think the minimal amount of 800 — they're still sticking by that. So you know, you might see them add about 50 to 100 a year over the next eight to 10 years., Howard: G.E.’s also reducing its quarterly dividend for shareholders. So how come we didn't see some of those moves under the former CEO Jeff Immelt, who preceded John Flannery?, Chesto: Well specifically with dividend, you know, this is not something the company does lightly. And what happened was with their power division, they had less cash coming in than they expected. That was probably the biggest culprit. They need more cash to come in to pay for such a generous dividend. And so they're just trying to right size it a bit, and by cutting it in half, that's going to save about $4 billion a year that they'd otherwise be sending to shareholders. If you're investing in G.E., that's a pretty big hit. You know, it goes from 96 cents a share per year to 48 cents a share per year, so that's extra income that you're not getting. And the stock’s down more than 30 percent this year and took another hit today. But the long term thinking, Flannery would say bet on us because we're more focused than ever before, we're more transparent from ever before, and we're positioned to grow. So I would be surprised to see the stocks fall much further. So I think you're going to see appreciation of the stock. I don't blame G.E. shareholders for being pretty upset, though. The stock has not done well for many years., Howard: But you're in New York. You were listening to John Flannery, the new CEO, and you sound confident that he's going to make good on his promises to Boston?, Chesto: He says he's confident. I'm … you know, I think there's still a lot of speculation that maybe they scaled back their headquarters project. I guess I would say I wouldn't rule it out. They tell me to rule it out. You know, I also think you know I wouldn't be surprised if maybe we don't get the 800 that maybe we're at 600 or 700 jobs and they don't get the full tax break, but they have so much time to get to that 800 jobs, it's so far in the future that I think it's likely that they can get there., Howard: OK. Time will tell. Thanks for joining us, Jon., Chesto: Thanks for having me., Howard: That's Jon Chesto. He covers business for The Boston Globe, and he's currently at General Electric's investor meeting in New York City., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
218,[Heather Unruh Has No Regrets About Coming Forward With Her Son's Alleged Sexual Assault],"[In the month since the accusations of sexual misconduct by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein surfaced, more and more victims are finding their voice and the courage to share their experiences of sexual harassment and assault against powerful and popular men. One of the latest includes former Boston TV news anchor Heather Unruh who, shortly after news of the Wenstein scandal broke, tweeted ""I was a Kevin Spacey fan until he assaulted a loved one. Time the dominoes fell."", Weeks later, actor Anthony Rapp accused ""House of Cards"" star Kevin Spacey of assaulting him when he was 14 years old, and others have since come forward. This prompted Netflix, which streams ""House of Cards,"" to drop Spacey from the show, and Sony to cut him from the upcoming film, ""All The Money In The World."" , Last week, Unruh revealed the identity of the loved one she mentioned in her tweet: her then-18-year-old son, who was allegedly sexually assaulted by Spacey last summer on Nantucket. The Cape and Islands District Attorney has opened an investigation into the allegations. , Unruh's son is being represented by lawyer Mitchell Garabedian, who is renowned for his representation of thousands of victims of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. Unurh and Garabedian joined Greater Boston to discuss the developing case. , If it weren't for the news of the Weinstein accusations, Unurh says the public would not yet know about her son's experience., ""My son always felt, from the beginning, that he wanted to do something to stop Kevin Spacey and to make sure he didn't hurt other people. He just was very, very afraid, and frankly, he was very embarassed,"" Unurh said. ""So this was a touchstone for us."", Unurh says the changing climate surrounding speaking up about sexual assault encouraged her son to come forward. Garabedian added that when one person speaks up, it emboldens others., ""An incredible amount of victims come forward who claim to have been sexually abused,"" he said. ""It empowers everyone."", For Unruh and her son, coming forward has not been without criticism. But Unruh says they have no regrets, and that Garabedian prepared her son well for the backlash he would receive., “Be proud. Tell the truth. You’re empowering yourself, you’re empowering other victims, you’re making the world safer for children. Be proud,"" Garabedian said. , Unruh says nearly half a dozen people have reached out to her about Spacey assaulting them, too, at least one of whom are connected to Nantucket. She says they are contemplating going public with their experiences, as well. ]"

In response to these allegations, Alabama State Auditor Jim Ziegler compared Moore’s actions to Joseph and Mary when asked about the allegations by the Washington Examiner., “Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus … There’s just nothing immoral or illegal here. Maybe just a little bit unusual,” Ziegler told the Examiner., Moore’s brother, Jerry Moore, even compared him directly to Jesus, telling CNN correspondent Martin Savidge that his brother is being persecuted like Jesus., Reverends Irene Monroe and Emmett Price joined Boston Public Radio Monday for another edition of All Revved Up. Both of the reverends emphatically condemned using the bible to defend Moore., “What you really see here is, again, how scripture is used more politically than it is used for a moral compass,” Monroe said, adding that she found the use of the biblical text very troubling, and as an effort to plug child molestation. “In many ways, [Ziegler] defiles and violates and rapes the iconic text."", ""This is a totally different situation, but I think that it is insane that this has become a balm in Gilead here,"" Price added.

225,[The Gangs Of Nantucket: The Arrival],"[This article is part one of a four-part series titled ""The Gangs of Nantucket."" Part two is available here. Part three is available here. Part four is available here., Mara Salvatrucha, best known as MS-13, is a transnational gang based in El Salvador. It has about 10,000 members in the United States. In recent years, immigration officials have arrested and deported dozens of MS-13 and rival 18th Street gang members from Massachusetts to El Salvador. Some arrests were made in Revere, East Boston, Lawrence and in an unsuspecting location for gang activity in this state: Nantucket Island., One day in May last year, we’re told that fog as thick as smoke had barely lifted over Nantucket Sound and the sun’s rays cut a slit through rainy grey clouds that landed on the deck of a ferry. Four agents attached to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, were on board heading to the island. Matthew Etre, until recently the special agent in charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England, a part of ICE, said, “We have to do like a lot of regular travelers and vacationers — take a ferry over to Nantucket.” , , His agency’s order in May of 2016 was to apprehend reported members of two notorious street gangs with roots in Central America and tentacles that extend throughout the U.S. They are also present on this resort island, which many regard as the summer paradise of the rich. Houses here sell for upwards of $25 million, and foreign laborers are needed to do the jobs the rich can’t or won’t., Resident Rodolfo Lemus runs down a list of jobs that are bringing immigrants here. “Driving taxis, working in restaurants, painting.” Lemus does manual work of all kinds here on Nantucket, and has carved out a decent life for him and his family. “I lived here for 17 years, and I like it because it is nice and quiet,” he said., Rodolfo Lemus — now a U.S. citizen — arrived here from Agua Caliente, El Salvador. Today, it’s estimated that a little more than 3,000 Salvadorans have made their way to Nantucket, many escaping wide-spread gang violence in their home country. , Along with those seeking refuge have come small numbers of MS-13 cliques and its arch rival, 18th Street, also known as Barrio 18.   Some of the island’s summer residents, like Hank Holliday — a wealthy South Carolina developer — are surprised to learn of a street gang presence on Nantucket, of all places.  , “What? I'm shocked,” said Holiday. “They sort of stick out here. This is like La la land here. No gangs on Nantucket.”, We talked on the Nantucket pier where yachts bobbed up and down on green-blue water. Holiday has owned a house on Nantucket for 50 years and thought he knew the island well. , But many year-rounders, like a taxi driver who asked to remain anonymous, may know the island even better. , “I've heard of MS-13 on the island yes,"" the driver said. ""It was in the newspaper. The incident where three gang members whacked the kid with a machete, and the kid did not testify against him in court. So, the judge had to throw it out.”, Isidro Lemus also recalled the incident. “There was a fight on Barlett Farm road,” he said.  “And of course I know the kid. [He's] in the street all the time. I see him, walking back and forth. Him and his other gang members.”, Lemus, Rodolfo’s brother, also lives year-round on Nantucket. Just about everyone knows him by name and reputation. He has helped construct hundreds of homes — and painted hundreds more — in the 27 years he’s lived here. With his 11-year old son Eric by his side during this interview, Lemus said he fears running into the same gangs that members of his family moved to Nantucket to escape.  “That's why every I'm trying to keep Eric away from the street,"" he said. ""Either he goes with me or he doesn't go anywhere else.”, Why are these gangs here? As Central Americans have moved here over the past few decades, MS-13 and 18th Street have seized an opportunity to extort fellow immigrants — many undocumented and afraid to go to the police. Gang-related drug trafficking is also a growing concern. , “We recently sent a couple of police officers off to get some further training and being able to identify symbols on buildings, graffiti certain ways they conduct themselves,"" said Nantucket police Lt. Angus MacVicar, who heads up operations. ""And we've been working with other outside agencies to sort of root out that issue before it grows and get some legs here in Nantucket.”, , Matthew Etre of ICE agreed. “As far as the operations on Nantucket, if there is a population that’s associated with gang activity, then we’re going to take action,"" he said. ""Most recently you see this uptick in MS-13 gang violence and of course that’s where we’re going to focus resources.”, That’s why on May 11th last year ICE was here on Nantucket. Henry Lemus Calderon was one of those targeted. His cell rang that morning on his way to school. His uncle was on the line. “My uncle told me the immigration want you,” said Calderon., ICE agents asked him to come down to the Nantucket police station. As Calderon told this story more than a year later in the custody of ICE, the chains around his ankles and wrists clanked., “So, I went with my uncle to the police, and he don’t tell me nothing,"" Calderon said. ""They put the handcuffs [on].”, That day ICE picked up five young men. Four had been involved in the machete incident that the taxi driver had read about in the newspaper. Two suspected members of MS-13 had left the island days earlier. One hid out in Rhode Island, the other in Utah, according to a confidential informant who spoke exclusively to WGBH News. , That afternoon, Calderon and the other four men were escorted by ICE agents onto a ferry to Hyannis. Zoila Gomez insisted that ICE and the Nantucket police erred in arresting Calderon as a gang member. , ""If you look at my client, and if you look at his background and the particularities of his person and the record, it just doesn’t add up,"" she said.   , Since the arrests in May 2016, some of the young men have been deported to El Salvador. Calderon is currently awaiting possible deportation.  , ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, A Recent History Of Gangs On Nantucket, 1980s and 1990s: Before a tiny clique of MS-13 and 18th Street gang members took root in Nantucket, a small group of Bloods ran drugs on the island in the late 1980’s and 1990’s, according to Nantucket police.   , 1998-2009: The FBI and Immigration officials in cooperation with Salvadoran police investigated a MS-13 leader with close connections to Nantucket. José Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, alias ""Medio Millon"" (Half a Million), led a clique in El Salvador. He is alleged to have murdered a witness there who knew about his criminal gang history on Nantucket, where he lived off and on from 1998 until 2009. He was arrested in Massachusetts for trafficking drugs on Nantucket and in other parts of the state. It’s unclear how he left the Bay State, but he was apprehended by Salvadoran police, put on trial and acquitted of murdering the witness in 2013, according to the Salvadoran newspaper, El Diario de Hoy. The investigative Latin American news-site InSight Crime also reported that in 2016 he was serving a prison sentence for extortion, gun-running and other crimes.  , 2007: In the first immigration sweep of its kind on the island on June 20, U.S. Immigration and Customs made 18 pre-dawn arrests. According to ICE, 16 of those arrested had prior criminal records, and several were connected to gangs. The Boston Globe reported, “Maryanne Worth, director of Nantucket's human services department, said the arrests reflect growing tensions within the immigrant community. She said gangs have begun forming on Nantucket, spawned by rivalries between immigrants from different Latin American countries.”  ICE during this period also arrested alleged MS-13 members in Hyannis. , 2015: On Jan. 17, 32-year-old Magno Sosa of Nantucket was murdered by 28-year-old Rigoberto Escobar, an 18th Street gang leader, while visiting friends in Everett. A police source said Escobar targeted Sosa because he was presumed to be a member of MS-13 on the island. But friends on Nantucket said it was a case of mistaken identity. Escobar was found guilty of first-degree murder, carrying a loaded firearm, possession of a firearm without a license and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Although Sosa was known to associate with MS-13 members, there is no evidence to suggest he was a gang member. , 2016:  Henry Lemus Calderon, identified by a Nantucket High school resource officer as a member of the 18th Street gang, was detained by ICE agents along with four other young men on May 11. ICE was also seeking Carlos-Santos Benitez, a self-identified member of MS-13, who left Nantucket for Rhode Island weeks before the raid, according to sources who spoke with WGBH News.  , 2017: Over the summer, ICE returned to the island on at least one occasion to pick up an undetermined number of young men identified as gang members. In August, alleged MS-13 member Victor Lemus — no relation to Henry Lemus Calderon — returned to Nantucket from Utah, where he fled in 2016, weeks before ICE agents arrived to the island.  In early September, following an immigration asylum hearing at the JFK Federal Building in downtown Boston, Lemus was arrested by ICE agents, who were waiting for him at the elevator outside immigration court. He was transferred to the Suffolk County Jail, but concerns about his safety prompted officials to transfer him to the ICE facility in Bristol County, where he is now awaiting possible deportation. Meanwhile, a former Nantucket High School Student, Erick Cangura, who was detained by ICE in 2016 on suspicion of belonging to MS-13, was deported to El Salvador earlier this year.    , This story was edited by Aaron Schachter and Ken Cooper. , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"
226,[Northeastern Celebrates Its Veterans],"[As students went to and from class Friday on Northeastern’s campus, a red, white and blue wreath decorated the university’s veterans memorial. It was placed there after the school’s annual Veteran's Day ceremony, during which more than 100 students, veterans, alumni, family and community members gathered to celebrate those who serve their country., The ceremony started with a presentation of the flag by Northeastern's ROTC cadets. The national anthem was sung by a cappella group Distilled Harmony. Several speakers  — including Paul Scherlek, president of the Student Veterans Organization, Maj. Joseph Luchetta, a professor of military science at Northeastern, Massachusetts Veterans Affairs Secretary Franciso Ureña and Northeastern president Joseph A. Aoun — thanked the veterans for their service. , ""To the veterans in the room, thank you providing us an example of true servant-leadership. We are utterly proud to be amongst your ranks,"" said Luchetta., ""The veterans themselves, who are here, part of the community, and students, too, have been leading the way,"" Aoun said. , , , After the ceremony ended, those in attendance gathered around the memorial to salute the veterans present and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving.  , , Northeastern University, home to more than 600 student veterans, is one of many colleges and universities around the nation working with the hundreds of thousands of veterans who pursue higher education each year. They are entitled to government assistance through the post-9/11 G.I. Bill, but many still face hurdles to getting their degrees. It can be difficult for veterans, who are often older, to fit in on campus. Often, their benefits don't pay for the full cost of tuition, which means they either have to take out loans or find work to make ends meet. , In addition to its Student Veterans Organization, Northeastern is home to the Center for the Advancement of Veterans and Servicemembers, or CAVS. The program helps prospective students, current students, alumni and other veterans navigate their education benefits so they can pursue meaningful careers. Its mission was born out of a desire to help veterans secure jobs after being discharged from the military, says Andy McCarty, an Air Force veteran who is the center’s director., “At the time that we started down this path, we saw that one of the challenges that veterans were facing was employment,” McCarty said. “We really felt like we could make a difference there because we could leverage the relationships that we already have and the experiential opportunities that we could offer to try and provide a unique program … to veterans.” , McCarty says many veterans attend an average of seven academic institutions before landing at the one that awards them a degree. While he says that is sometimes due to servicemembers being deployed or moving around, he says some of it is because not all institutions of higher learning have veterans’ best interests at heart., “Unfortunately, there are institutions out there who see veterans and they see dollar signs. Nobody’s there to provide a high level of service,” he said. “So they end up transferring or kind of degree shopping as they bounce around because there’s not a great system in place to advise them in these decisions.”, To avoid this, CAVS helps veterans channel their skills into careers and partners with local employers such as Maximus, Inc., Dell EMC and State Street Corporation. CAVS also hosts networking events for employers who value veterans as part of their workforce., And CAVS supports incoming student veterans through one of their biggest challenges — transitioning to campus life., “They’ve probably been away from an academic setting for years, sometimes decades,"" McCarty said. “For anybody that’s been away for that long, they’re really trying to kind of play catch up.”, McCarty adds that typically, Northeastern’s student veterans are older than traditional students — sometimes even older than their instructors — which can lead to a feeling of not fitting in. But that’s another area where CAVS steps in to help, by fostering a community that resembles the camaraderie servicemembers experience while active in the military., , ""When I was in the military, there was always some one there to ... help out whenever I needed it,"" said Michael Pasqua, vice president of the Northeastern's Student Veteran Organization and an Air Force veteran. ""When I left the military, I wasn't sure where that support was going to be. When I saw that in the veteran organization on campus, I clicked with that group. We spend a lot of time together and reflect on our military experiences and experiences and students."", That camaraderie was apparent at Friday’s ceremony., ""It's really great to see people that are still really involved ... and celebrating what we do, because it's not easy,"" said ROTC cadet Aleksandra Pigor, a fourth-year student at Northeastern, who plans to join the army after she graduates. ""It's cool to see people that have graduated and still are motivated to come back."" , , , Northeastern’s relationship to the veteran community was formalized in 1918, when the U.S. government implemented a Student Army Training Corps program at the university. In the decades that followed, Northeastern offered training and education to service members, and was also one of only two universities in the greater Boston area that did not expel its ROTC students during the Vietnam War., In 2009, the university invested $2 million in the Yellow Ribbon program, enabling more veterans to pursue higher education at Northeastern.

234,"[Mitchell Garabedian, Lawyer For Heather Unruh, Discusses Sexual Abuse Claim Against Kevin Spacey]","[Barbara Howard:  Actor Kevin Spacey, facing new allegations of sexual assault. Yesterday, former Boston TV news anchor Heather Unruh accused Spacey of groping her 18-year-old son at a Nantucket restaurant in July of last year. She says her son was star struck and claims that Spacey plied him with drinks before assaulting him. It is the latest in a flood of sexual harassment and assault allegations that have come to light against people in the public eye, including Spacey. Boston lawyer Mitchell Garabedian is representing Unruh’s son. Garabedian is perhaps best known for representing victims of sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic priests. He's with us now on the line. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Garabedian., Mitchell Garabedian: Thank you for having me., Howard: Well there was talk of evidence given over to the Nantucket Police last week backing up Unruh’s allegations against Spacey. What is this evidence?, Garabedian: Well, unfortunately, I can't tell you because there is a pending criminal investigation., Howard: It has been nearly a year and a half. The evidence was handed over to the Nantucket Police just last week. Why the wait?, Garabedian: It's not uncommon in sexual abuse cases for victims to come forward when they're able to come forward, when they have the power to come forward, the strength and courage to come forward. I have had victims wait in excess of 50 years before they come forward to report being sexually abused. So it's a matter of timing, it’s a matter of emotions, and it's a matter of strength., Howard: But when it's this much of a gap, though, does it make it more difficult for your client's case?, Garabedian: I don't know at this point in time. A year isn't a whole lot of time, given the decades that can go by. Victims often wait 10, 20 years, 30 years, 40 years, before they come forward. So I don't really think that one year is going to matter., Howard: This is well within the statute of limitations, right?, Garabedian: Yes, civilly, it's well within the statute of limitations, and in my understanding in a criminal law, it’s well within the statute of limitations., Howard: What charges could Spacey face and what possible sentencing, if he is found guilty?, Garabedian: Well you'd really have to speak to the district attorney with regard to what crimes he'd be charged with, if any., Howard: According to what Unruh said to the press yesterday, she says that her son says that when Spacey got up to go to the restroom, a woman at that Nantucket restaurant stepped in and encouraged Unruh’s son to run away, which he did, all the way to his grandmother's house. Now, Unruh has publicly thanked that woman and called for her to step forward. Have you figured out who that woman was?, Garabedian: We haven't figured out who that woman was. We're looking for her. And we'd like — and Ms. Unruh would like to thank her personally., Howard: What could this woman do in terms of helping you help your client?, Garabedian: First of all, it would be important to Ms. Unruh to thank this woman for being so protective of her son. This woman showed a lot of courage herself by stepping in and telling her son to run., Howard: How could the woman be helpful, though, to you as the attorney, in helping her son?, Garabedian: Well, that's common sense in the sense of ""What did you see? When did you see it? How did you see it? Where did you see it? What did you do?"", Howard: What prompted Unruh to go to the media with her son's allegations?, Garabedian: Ms. Unruh wants to encourage other victims of sexual abuse to come forward to help with transparency, to help with the healing process. Each and every victim has to go through his or her own healing process and, unfortunately, victims usually don't heal fully, but they usually are able to cope with being harmed when sexually abused. It's a process of closure, a process of healing, a process transparency., Howard: What are the next steps at this point? You said that you plan on contacting Spacey., Garabedian: At this point in time, I'm conducting my own investigation — determining what witnesses exist, what they know about the situation, when they knew it, what they did. Very important. Apparently, there are a lot of individuals associated with this alleged sexual abuse. We want to know what they knew. I am also informed that Mr. Spacey also had an individual with him. We want to find out the identity and find out what he knew., Howard: That evening, you’re saying., Garabedian: Yes, that evening., Howard: Well thanks for joining us, Mr. Garabedian., Garabedian: Thank you., Howard: That's attorney Mitchell Garabedian, he’s representing former Boston TV news anchor Heather Unruh's son. Unruh claims that actor Kevin Spacey groped her then-18-year-old son a year ago in July at a restaurant on Nantucket.  , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

239,[How Cara Belvin Empowers Young Girls Coping With The Loss Of Their Mothers],"[The loss of a parent isn't easy for anyone. Imagine that loss coming at the young age of 8 or 9., One Massachusetts nonprofit has set out to specifically support girls who have lost their moms through social gatherings and mentorship. The woman behind EmpowerHer is Cara Belvin, our latest Greater Bostonian. , Belvin was just 9 years old in 1996 when her mother died of breast cancer. , “My mom was beautiful and smart and funny. She really lit up a room,"" said Belvin, who lives in Scituate. ""I just felt at the time that I was the only girl in the world whose mother had died. I didn’t have opportunities to meet other girls like me and who could relate to my loss,” she said., Years later, Belvin, who had become a mother herself, realized she could help connect girls who had experienced what she did. Four years ago, Belvin started EmpowerHer, which hosts events like group rock climbs for girls who have lost their mothers., “My vision for EmpowerHer was, really, these events that would have low pressure. They would be relaxed, and the girls would be comfortable and come together in very sort of easy-breezy events like cooking classes and writing classes and beach parties and a sleepover on Mother’s Day weekend.”, , But Belvin soon realized the girls might need more than events, so two years ago, she added another component., “I wanted to start a mentor program — a program that would look a lot like Big Brothers Big Sisters, where we could pair with a positive role model from the community. And in some cases, that woman that we make a match with is a woman who can relate to [a girl's] loss,” she explained., Andrea Mancinelli and 18-year-old Jess Digangi, both of Lynnfield, were matched two years ago — a year after Digangi lost her mom. Digangi said the two like to watch Downton Abby together and go shopping., “She has that mother-like role. She kind of reminds me of my mom. I do a lot of the same stuff I would do with my mom with Andrea,” Digangi said., Andrea Mancinelli said the relationship holds rewards for her, too., , “It’s just really great to be able to at least try to be able to give something back to her and to help her through some tough times and also just kind of bring that fun back,” Mancinelli said. “A lot of times I’ll just text and kind of say, ‘I’m thinking of you.’”  , Belvin left her full-time job as a nonprofit consultant to run EmpowerHer, which relies entirely on donations. She believes her mom would have approved., “She’d be proud that I was doing anything to, I guess, speak up or speak out on a topic that still, unfortunately, might even be considered more of a taboo topic,” Belvin said., More than 100 girls of all ages attend the annual Mother’s Day retreat and other gatherings. So far, 20 of them have been paired with mentors., Because of Belvin’s vision, the girls have a community of support and friendship., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"

She was posting on social media that she was really worried out about her family on the island., She posted these messages on Facebook just after the hurricane hit:, Andrea Crossan, Jennifer was born in Puerto Rico. She moved to Boston when she was 5., Jennifer says her most vivid childhood memory from that time was when she was in kindergarten., “I clearly remember me being in a play, and I was this orange flower,” Jennifer smiles. “I don’t know why that’s so vibrant in my head, being that flower. That’s pretty much the last memory I have of living there.”, She and her family have been visiting Puerto Rico regularly over the years. Her younger sister Jenelyn Santos was born on the US mainland but talks to her cousins and aunts on the island all the time., So, for Jennifer and Jenelyn and their mother, Janet Franceschini Colon, it’s been hard not knowing how their family is doing., Since the hurricane blew over the US territory, communication has been difficult., Most of the cellular phone towers aren’t working. Outside of the capital, San Juan, there is almost no cell service., “We still haven’t communicated with our family in Puerto Rico,” says Jennifer., And the Boston family is particularly worried about the oldest relative on the island — Nereida Franceschini Colon. She’s 75 and she’s their grandmother. Nereida lives in the southern part of the island in a small town called Guayanilla. It’s normally a two-hour drive from the capital, San Juan. But after the hurricane, roads were blocked by fallen trees and debris., There are around 5 million Puerto Ricans living on the US mainland. And right after the hurricane, flights were nearly impossible to get. No one was getting in; no one was getting out. So, if you can’t communicate, and you can’t get there — what can you do, besides worry?, The Franceschini family asked us to bring this letter to Puerto Rico to give to their grandmother, Nereida Franceschini Colon. , Jasmine Garsd/PRI , I told Jennifer and Jenelyn that I was going to Puerto Rico with Jasmine Garsd to report on post-hurricane recovery.

248,[4 Local Election Outcomes You Should Know About],"[For voters in cities surrounding the Greater Boston area, this year's election cycle meant sustaining legacies, creating change, making history, and speaking as a community. Here is a look at four of Tuesday's noteworthy elections in Middlesex and Essex counties., Salem mayor gets four more years , In Salem, incumbent mayor Kim Driscoll, who first took office in 2005, was re-elected for the third time. Voters also supported a ballot question on a controversial ordinance on immigration policy., Driscoll won re-election with 66 percent of the vote over former City Councilor Paul Prevey. Driscoll is a supporter of the city’s so-called Sanctuary for Peace ordinance, which was also on the ballot. The ordinance says city employees, except police officers, shall refrain from inquiring about immigration status. Driscoll said that doesn’t make Salem a sanctuary city, but Prevey argued the ordinance could lead to Salem losing federal funding. Tuesday's referendum on the ordinance divided voters — 57 percent of them said they approve of it, compared to 43 percent who would have liked to have seen it repealed. , Lynn opts for change, In Lynn, incumbent mayor Judith Flanagan Kennedy was defeated by State Sen. Thomas McGee. , McGee’s win was a convincing one — beating Flanagan Kennedy 65 percent to 35 percent. Flanagan Kennedy is a conservative Republican who has said Central American immigrants were draining city resources. McGee is a Democrat who served four terms in the state House of Representatives before being elected to the Senate in 2002, where he currently serves as the co-chair of the Legislature’s transportation committee. , Newton elects its first woman mayor, In one of the tighter races of the day, voters in Newton elected their first-ever woman mayor. City Councilor At-Large Ruthanne Fuller edged out City Council President Scott Lennon. Fuller will replace mayor Setti Warren, who stepped down to run for governor., With more than 24,400 votes cast in Newton, the difference came down to less than 350 votes. The race became a more heated one, focused on class and gender roles, after one of Lennon's ads emphasized he was the only candidate who’d continuously held a full-time job; Fuller stopped working full time to raise her now-grown children. Voters also rejected a controversial ballot proposal that would have cut the number of city councilors in half — from 24 to 12 — and would have changed the system so councilors would be elected by citywide vote, rather than from within local wards. , Lowell unites to preserve its downtown high school, The election in Lowell came down to one issue: whether to renovate the city's existing high school, or build a new one on the edge of town. , A proposal to build a new high school in Lowell’s leafy Belvidere neighborhood became a heated topic of debate in the city, and was soundly shot down by voters Tuesday. In a referendum on the subject, 61 percent of voters supported renovating the current downtown high school, compared to 39 percent who wanted the new school built. The issue divided candidates on the City Council and school board elections. The Lowell Sun reports that seven of the nine city councilors who were elected favor a downtown high school, as well as five of six school committee members. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

She will succeed Dorchester Councilor Tito Jackson, who gave up his seat to challenge Mayor Marty Walsh., Janey captured a full quarter of the vote among 13 candidates in September's preliminary election and beat Faulk with 55.5 percentage of the vote on Election Day., ""We see this big economic boom throughout the city and so many folks have been left out and are really feeling the pinch and being squeezed out of the community, so really wanting to make sure that we're doing something to address the housing crisis in our community,"" Janey told supporters at Merengue on Blue Hill Avenue Tuesday night after securing her win., Since Boston adopted the current structure of its council in 1983, a succession of African-American men has represented the district that encompasses Roxbury and parts of Dorchester, the South End and Fenway.

258,[Boston Athletic Association CEO Salutes Marblehead Woman Who Won NYC Marathon],"[Barbara Howard: By now you have likely heard the news: Shalane Flanagan of Marblehead is the first American woman in 40 years to win the New York City Marathon. But there is a backstory to her win, and joining me on the line is Thomas Grilk. He's CEO of the Boston Athletic Association, organizers of the Boston Marathon. Hi, Tom., Thomas Grilk: Barbara, hi., Howard: Well, Flanagan, let me ask you about her — she's 36 years old. It said that she ran her first marathon back in 2010. Presumably she was, what, 29 years old for the first marathon? She came in second place, but isn't that kind of late to start running marathons?, Grilk: It's late, now, for people to start running marathons. But for a long time, Shalane followed the time-tested model of being a track runner for a long time, and only graduating to the marathon after the track career was starting to wind down. And she had won what turned out to be a silver medal in the Olympic Games in 2008 on the track. So in 2010, she moved up in distance., Howard: OK, so after she did that first marathon in 2010 — that was seven years ago. What's she been doing? She was, what, on the Olympic teams, I understand?, Grilk: She has largely been running longer races, although she's run a great many distances. She's run a number of marathons, she’s run very fast times in New York and, particularly, in Berlin. But she also ran an American record for 10 kilometers on the road here in Boston at the BAA 10K., Howard: OK, now she did not make it to the Boston Marathon this year?, Grilk: She did not run in Boston this year because she had experienced a stress fracture in her back., Howard: Now, she does have experience, though, watching the marathon — I understand her father was a runner?, Grilk: Her father, Steve, was a very good runner. He was about a 2:17 marathoner. But her mother, Cheryl, held the world record in the marathon back in the 1970s., Howard: My goodness, OK, so, now the race itself it just happened this weekend, she was just – what, a few miles short of the finish line, it looks like, when she made her move going past the Kenyan runner who had won the last three years. Is that right?, Grilk: In Sunday's New York City Marathon, Shalane was very carefully watching Mary Keitany, the winner of the last three years of the New York City marathon, and expecting Keitany to make a break, which is what she normally will do. But Keitany never did it, and finally, Shalane Flanagan decided it was her time to go, and she did. Mary Keitany never matched that move, and Shalane had her international marathon win., Howard: Were you there, were you able to watch this?, Grilk: I was there watching at the finish line as Shalane was coming in. It was — it was fun. It was emotional. It was a lovely day., Howard: Did you have a chance to talk to her?, Grilk: Well, she had a lot to say to a great many people. I did not want to push in the way of those who were there. We'll have quieter times to reflect on how all that went for her when she's back in Boston here., Howard: Talk about the runner who she credits with inspiring her, Meb Keflezighi., Grilk: Shalane has often credited Meb Keflezighi as being her inspiration. Meb is somebody who had won the New York City Marathon a number of years ago, was an Olympic medalist for the United States in the marathon, overcame a lot of childhood challenges. His family moved from Eritrea, which was a war torn country, to Italy, and then to the United States. What Meb did most emotionally was win the 2014 Boston Marathon, one year after the bombing, in a way that captured the hearts of people around the world. He knew how hard Shalane had been working to earn a victory in a marathon on the world stage, and was encouraging to her all the time. They were in regular communication leading up to the TCS New York City Marathon this year, as he was both encouraging and helpful in the days leading up., Howard: And it's kind of ironic that he was the runner the year after the Boston Marathon bombings, and now here she comes along, and just five days before her win at the New York Marathon, of course, that truck plowed into people on a bicycle path there — both of them, you know, winning marathons in those respective cities following great tragedy. Did that inspire her, do you think, in any way?, Grilk: Shalane was inspired and working hard for a long time, but I am sure that as she looked back to the very recent tragedy that had taken place in New York City and the resilience of New Yorkers all along the way as she ran, it was in her mind that she was not simply helping people to elevate their spirits, but joining in with the hundreds and hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions of New Yorkers, who were out there to say that they would live their lives the way they choose, no matter what anyone else does to try to stop them., Howard: OK, thank you so much for talking with us., Grilk: You are very kind to ask. Thank you., Howard: That's Thomas Grilk. He's chief executive officer of the Boston Athletic Association, organizers of the Boston Marathon. , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
259,[The Future Of Fraternities],"[Barbara Howard: Fraternities and sororities, under fire after headline-grabbing excesses on campuses. Pulitzer finalist and two-time Polk Award winner John Hechinger took a deep dive into Greek life and writes about it in his new book ""True Gentlemen."" He joins me now in the studio. Thanks for coming in, John., John Hechinger: Thank you, Barbara., Howard: Well, you pretty much embedded yourself in one of the country's largest and arguably most controversial fraternity, Sigma Alpha Epsilon. And there are some SAE chapters, I should say, at colleges in the Boston area. But why was SAE your focus?, Hechinger: Well, they had, for almost a decade, more deaths than any other fraternity. They were literally the deadliest fraternity., Howard: That fraternity, as you pointed out in the book, also has the highest insurance rates of any fraternity in the country?, Hechinger: That's right. During that period when they had so many deaths, it was difficult for them to get insurance., Howard: A documentary on campus sexual assault was done. It's called ""The Hunting Ground,"" and it featured SAE. And in that documentary, some campus women were quoted in the film as saying that SAE is short for ‘sexual assault expected’ — it was that bad., Hechinger: That's right. They went around the country and they asked women what the initials stood for, and they all came up with that., Howard: And then there was SAE’s memorable nine-second video — it went viral a couple of years ago showing members on a bus singing a racist chant, of course with the ""N-word"" embedded in it. And I'm going to quote it here it says, ‘You can hang them from a tree, but they will never sign with me.’ And here it is from that bus video., (SOUND CLIP FROM VIDEO), ""There'll never be a [expletive] in SAE. There'll never be a [expletive] in SAE. You can hang them from a tree, but they will never sign with me, there'll never be a [expletive] in SAE."", Howard: So with this kind of reputation, why was it that you chose to profile SAE?, Hechinger: Well, because they were really struggling with this legacy. In fact, they risked losing their insurance coverage. So it enabled me to kind of go inside the fraternity in a way that I don't think any other fraternity in the country would have allowed: fraternity guys going through leadership training, learning the ways of the true gentleman, their creed., Howard: That is, of course, the title of your book, ""True Gentlemen."" So talk about that — that title was borrowed from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon creed., Hechinger: That's right. It's words to live by, and gives a good sense of how they could reform themselves., Howard: I'm going to read the creed in part, quote, “The true gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety.” And then it goes on to talk about self-control, of humility, and it ends with the words, “A man who thinks of the rights and feelings of others rather than his own. And a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.” So given those tapes on the bus and everything else, how is it that SAE strayed so far from those ideals?, Hechinger: Well, fraternities have had a split personality from the very beginning. The first fraternity was actually founded in a tavern and turned into an honor society and that’s very respected — Phi Beta Kappa. They kind of taught American colleges how to foster leadership., Howard: But these ways that they've gone astray, that's not unique to SAE. You know, you talk about fraternities on the national level trying to rein in the individual chapters on the campuses, but pretty much, they leave it to the deans or the campus police to deal with that kind of misconduct. And then there's the liability insurance that fraternity members have to pay. Talk about that., Hechinger: Well, you have to pay several hundred dollars a year for liability insurance, but most families don't understand that that essentially protects the national fraternity, not the members. If there's some kind of problem related to underage drinking, for example, the fraternity will distance itself. The families will have to look to their homeowner's policies to protect their kids in court. So parents might want to think about having a pretty stern talk with their kids if they join a fraternity., Howard: The graduates of these fraternities, the brotherhood, has a fair amount of clout. You write in your book that one-third of the U.S. Supreme Court justices were once fraternity members, that two-fifths of U.S. senators, one-quarter of House members once enjoyed Greek life. And talk about the frat PAC., Hechinger: So there's this powerful PAC in Washington that defends the rights of fraternities., Howard: And there was an attempt to try to get sexual assault victims, mostly women, to go first to police and not get the frat brothers in trouble. And of course, that's problematic for many women who are reluctant to go to police. But that was pushed by the frat PAC, as I understand it?, Hechinger: That's right. They eventually gave up on that proposal when even their own members, fraternity men, felt that it was going way too far., Howard: Well, given all of this, are fraternities redeemable? It's surprising that they've survived all these years., Hechinger: Well, they're so ingrained in most campuses — they're among the most loyal alumni. They have this incredible career network, they house 250,000 students. So they're here to stay. But what I've discovered also is that there have been college presidents over the years who have taken on fraternities, who've said that they can't be changed and that they would lose donations, and they found that they could actually change the campus social life. They could either get rid of fraternities, as Williams did, or they can try to regulate them much more, as the University of Rhode Island did. And they can see a great reduction in hospitalizations and assaults and deaths., Howard: OK, thank you so much, John., Hechinger: Thank you, Barbara., Howard: John Hechinger new book is ""True Gentlemen: The Broken Pledge of America's Fraternities."", Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

A place where people go to escape the horrors of life, not be swallowed by them. These places — churches, movie theaters, concert halls and schools — are sanctuaries and outlets where people go for relief in times of hardship.

For Monroe, though, there is no amount of preparedness that can account for every eventuality and ensure safety. She believes that the attacks on sacred grounds have changed the culture of worship., “You are most vulnerable when you are going into church. It is the whole idea of leaving the problems of the world outside, and in this one place you are able to be in community with one another,” said Monroe. “We are at a new norm … it is a different culture now.”, The assumption is that the church has always been a safe place, Price added. While this assumption has been shaken, he does not believe that it is gone.  , “People are resilient.

265,[Gold Star Father Khizr Khan To America: Be Like Boston],"[When Gold Star father Khizr Khan took the stage at the Democratic National Convention during the 2016 election, he pulled his pocket constitution from his jacket and asked then-candidate Donald Trump a question., “Donald Trump, you are asking Americans to trust you with your future,” Khan said. “Let me ask you, have you even read the U.S. constitution? I will gladly lend you my copy. In this document, look for the words 'liberty' and 'equal protection of law.'”, Khan lost his son, Muslim Army Captain Humayun S.M. Khan, in Iraq in 2004. During his speech to Trump, Khan touched on the president’s record with diversity, including his comments on immigration. “Have you ever been to Arlington Cemetery?” Khan continued. “Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending [the] United States of America — you will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities.”, Since the convention, Khan (and his pocket constitution) has made 165 media appearances, traveling the country to encourage “meaningful conversations” about the “goodness” of the United States. Khan joined Boston Public Radio hosts Jim Braude and Margery Eagan Monday to discuss his memoir, “An American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice.”, The following excerpt of their conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity., JIM BRAUDE: When you first saw the Declaration of Independence, felt it, read it, the U.S. Constitution ... what was that like for you, and why?   I see that you brought your pocket constitution with you … tell us about when you were a law student in Pakistan when you first touched those documents.    , KHIZR KHAN: For your audience to understand what background I come from, I had lived under two martial laws where I had to have a permit to go and buy a bag of sugar or flour or be able to come out of the house on the street, or to go to school … when the martial law was imposed, no one [would] dare to come out. The very first thing that these authoritarians do ... is that they go after the press. Shut down the newspapers, lock them up, put all of the reporters and all of the media — they are no good, put them in prison. The only condition they impose, they will be released and you can print newspapers if you never criticize the dictator, you never criticize the ruler, the general and the martial law administrator. I came from that background., Then ... I had brought the materials when I was in my second year of law school ... the full constitution. The very first page that was on top of those materials was the words ‘Declaration of Independence.’ I thought — these words are treason. You are committing a crime against the colonist, how come these people have this courage that they declared their independence? You wait for the mercy of your ruler, of your king, of your dictator to give you independence. You argue, you plead … but you never declare, because that is [a] death warrant. I read it in one standing, all of it, all of the 18 grievances that are listed in this, 1,338 words of the Declaration of Independence … what an amazing nation this would be. I did not have the capacity ... to even dream or think, would I be able to go there, to see these people? And here we are., BRAUDE: You were kind enough [to do an interview] for Greater Boston ... I think off the air, I asked you how many appearances you've made. I think so far, since the convention, 160, is that what it was? , KHAN: Coming to Boston ... this is [the] 165th., BRAUDE: You don't take compensation for these appearances, you ask just to cover your expenses. How do you afford all of this?, KHAN: These are all pro-bono ... that’s what this journey is all about. Ghazala and I specifically decided that we will continue, as long as we are invited to meaningful conversation, going to communities, heartening them, talking about how much goodness of this country still prevails, regardless of some divisiveness and very little ugliness that exists in this country., I come from Charlottesville, Virginia. We thought that we had buried that Nazi flag in Germany. My sons and daughters and thousands died in defeating that racism, that concept of supremacy, of one race over others. That is so undemocratic. Democracy does not allow, does not accept any supremacy. It is equality that is democracy, liberty is the same thing. I saw with my own eyes, that 12th of August attack on Charlottesville, [that] display of weapons and guns and threatening chants and ugliness that was on full display., Then on Saturday, the 13th of August, my daughter (I call her my daughter out of affection) Heather Heyer was murdered by a white supremacist. But then Wednesday, Charlottesville came together, there was a family march … but then we saw the true American spirit in Boston, when these half-dozen racists showed up here to assault this beloved city, this city of patriots., I never hesitate, throughout the country, since then, whenever I have the opportunity, to tell America: look towards Boston.

I'm the only one that matters, because when it comes to it, that's what the policy is going to be.”, Sennott said he found this position irresponsible and called it the “CEO mentality of the presidency.”, “The great presidents of this country have always had very wise counsel, particularly in an area as complicated as Asia, and particularly in an area as complicated as the Korean peninsula at a time of heightened tensions, and what many fear is one of the most dangerous teeterings toward nuclear conflict that we’ve had since World War II,” said Sennott., Charlie Sennott is a news analyst at WGBH, where he also heads up the Ground Truth Project.

267,[Five Takeaways From Salem's Halloween Crowd Control Wizardry],"[Halloween in Salem is a spectacle — think of it as a kind of Goth Mardi Gras. People are out to party with the weirdest, wildest costumes and accompanying behavior. , But despite the debauchery and crowds that can reach 70,000, there are practically no public disturbances. This year, the Salem Police Department made only 3 arrests., Do the Salem Police have some special secret for effective crowd control? , Captain Conrad Prosniewski, Salem Police’s commander in charge of support services, says it’s pretty simple. As Halloween in Salem has grown into a huge event over the decades, the police has adapted their response over time. , “Every year we started to change our tactics and tweak things on what worked and what didn't. And we finally come up with a template that … we've been going by for the last 15 or 20 years or so in crowd control,” he said. , Prosniewski says there’s no crowd psychology master plan that anyone can learn. , “It's not something that's taught black and white in the police academy,” he said. , John Jay College of Criminal Justice Professor Maria (Maki) Haberfeld agrees. She has served in enforcement in Israel and in the U.S. and has studied police training in environments around the world. She says there’s no “best practices template.” There’s simply no substitute for “knowing your environment, and knowing the public that you're going to police.”, But that approach — Salem’s strategy, rather than its tactics — can provide some universal takeaways for approaching crowd control. Here are five:, 1. Know Your Town, Every part of Salem is covered by police on Halloween night. It is impossible to be on the streets downtown and not be in the line of sight of at least one officer. , “We basically do it by separating the city into segments, five different sectors,” said Prosniewski. Each “has its own command staff, its own police officers; it's almost like five police departments in the downtown area that have their boundaries, and they have people assigned to them from different agencies, so you have a commander in charge with his own staff.” , Haberfeld says this approach “has a long history of effectiveness when you need to control crowds, and especially when you need to control crowds that aren't predictable.”, It’s also great for children, and adults, who get lost., , 2. Less is More, When it comes to crowd control, Salem Police Chief Mary Butler says “we try not to be too pushy. We learned that early on [that] trying to push the crowd … that's when all hell breaks loose.” , What you see on the streets of Salem on Halloween night doesn’t look like what you would even think of as crowd control. There are no cops on horseback or wearing special gear, clearing the streets with bullhorns. The police basically hang back and let the crowd clear itself., 3. Give The Crowd Instructions Ahead of Time, Haberfeld says giving the crowd a clear plan ahead of time means “it's not left to be some sort of spontaneous event that can take dangerous turns from the perspective of crowd control.” , Salem’s most useful tool for accomplishing this may be the Halloween fireworks. , “The fireworks is the big sign, and that's something we learned probably about seven or eight years ago,” said Prosniewski. “When people see the fireworks going off over the train station, it acts as a as a sign for people to start leaving, and they do. People realize it's the end of the night. And we usually have quite an orderly exit slow orderly exit out of town.”  , The planning works brilliantly, but a lot of groundwork is required to make sure the crowds know what to do. For instance, when you get into the Salem T station on Halloween night, they make it clear that the last train is at 11. The police, local transit and government post details of what happens when all over social media., “This an example of good police-community relations that happens before the [event] starts,” said Haberfeld. She says that the police communicating clearly ahead of time that public alcohol consumption will not be tolerated, means the crowd arrives “in a different frame of mind, and a different state of mind.”, , 4. Know Your Crowd, Telling a crowd of thousands what to do is easy, but getting them to listen? That requires not just getting the word out well ahead of time, but year-round engagement with the community. Prosniewski says that is at an all-time high. , “I found this year, particularly, that the public banter with our law enforcement people has been very, very good. There's been a lot of people coming up and shaking our hands and telling us, ‘thank you for being here. We love seeing so many of you are out here. We feel safe.’ I mean, it's just been an unusual amount of that this year,” he said. “In this day and age, when sometimes police work isn't the most popular profession, it's kind of nice to see people go come over and give you a pat on the back.”, But the Salem Police can’t rest on that good feeling. They can’t really rest at all, in fact, which leads us to the final lesson of Salem’s Halloween success:, 5. Prepare Ahead of Time, For an annual event this big, it never stops. The Salem Police Department has already started their analysis of this year’s Halloween and is going straight into planning for 2018., Arun Rath is the host of WGBH News' All Things Considered. ]"

270,"[After Honoring NFL Legend's Brain Donation, VA Secretary Calls Football Injuries 'Very Different' From Soldiers']","[President Trump has been critical of the NFL’s steps to reduce brain injuries on the field. But today, his Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, stood next to a local football legend as he agreed to donate his brain to research. , For years, linebacker Nick Buoniconti was feasome on the field during his NFL career, which included a stint on what was then called the Boston Patriots. Now 76-years-old, he choked up as he pledged to donate his brain for research. He was diagnosed with dementia in May, and his doctors suspect chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, may be contributing to his symptoms., “This is not easy,"" Buoniconti said. ""It’s difficult. I’m not half the man I used to be.”, Buoniconti acknowledged Dr. Ann McKee, who leads the BU center that’s studying the impact that concussions have on the brain. “I just want to thank her for all her dedication and her work, and ask the president to please support the CTE program.”, Of course, he was speaking about President Trump, who is supporting the BU Center, in that its research funding comes from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. That’s because the VA is concerned about soldiers getting this kind of injury. But Trump took a slightly different tone on the subject in September when he spoke at a rally about the NFL’s efforts to reduce traumatic brain injuries on the field by penalizing hard hits., “They had that last week,"" Trump said. ""I watched for a couple of minutes and two guys, just really beautiful tackle. Boom, 15 yards! The referee gets on television, his wife is sitting at home, she is so proud of him. They're ruining the game!”, , Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin stood next to Buoniconti as he signed the agreement to donate his brain for CTE research. WGBH News asked Shulkin about the president's comments. Shulkin drew a distinction between injuries in soldiers and football players., “There's a difference. I don't think either the president or I feel that going and serving your country is a game,"" Shulkin said. ""We take this very seriously. Young men and women coming back with these injuries, and everything possible that research can do and treatment can do, he is fully supportive of, as I am. Having elective choices to go out versus serving your country are two very different things."", , For the NFL's part, about five years ago, the league committed to supporting CTE research with a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health. But the NFL ended that agreement in August, with more than half of the money not yet spent. , The VA says it is spending over $100 million to study the effects of brain injuries in returning soldiers. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
271,[Framingham Campaign Contributions Reflect A New City’s Lingering Divide],"[After four failed tries and 104 years, Framingham voted to become a city in April. The newly written city charter barely squeaked by in a town referendum, winning by 112 votes — a clear indication of a community nearly evenly divided over its path forward., In the seven months since, divisions in the Boston suburb of 70,000 haven’t healed. Days before the new city’s first mayoral elections, the community seems to be just as divided — and along similar lines — over who will serve as its first mayor. Many of those who led the charge to make Framingham a city have lined up behind one candidate, while many of those who fought against the new city charter are backing the other., This divide is especially clear in the campaign finance data, which reveal by far the most expensive election in the town’s history. Many of the donations have come from outside Framingham and from owners and managers of businesses, real estate developers and construction companies., What this means for Framingham’s future — as it evolves from a town meeting form of government to leadership by a mayor and city council — depends on with whom you talk., Mayoral Candidates Yvonne Spicer and John Stefanini face off Tuesday in a tight race. Though Spicer won more than 50 percent of the vote in the preliminary election, Stefanini has raised more money. As of Oct. 20, Stefanini had raised about $113,000, while Spicer had raised about $70,000, according to public campaign finance reports., Spicer, though, has donations from more people. Approximately 510 donors have given an average of about $136. Sixty-five percent of her contributors have addresses listed in Framingham., By contrast, Stefanini’s funds have come from about 380 people. The average amount donated to his campaign is just under $300 per contributor, and 41 percent of his donors have listed addresses in Framingham., More than half of the 42 donors that gave Stefanini $1,000, the maximum amount allowed by law, are the owners or managers at real estate development firms, construction companies and Framingham-based businesses., Of the 14 donors who have contributed the maximum $1,000 to Spicer’s campaign, more than half list their employer as retired, self-employed or not employed.  , , Campaign war chests of $70,000 and more may seem small relative to other cities, but they are new to Framingham. To put this number in perspective, between 2010 and 2014, no individual running for public office in Framingham raised more than $20,000 in one year, and most raised less than $12,000, according to the campaign finance reports available on the town clerk's website., Raising big money for elections started in 2015, with the formation of Framingham First, an organization dedicated to promoting Framingham’s change to a city form of government., Framingham — one of the most socio-economically, racially and ethnically diverse communities in Massachusetts — once held the title of the largest town in the United States. The community has long debated whether a town meeting, with its roughly 200 members, was the most effective way to govern., Framingham voters are grappling with a number of key issues, including four under-performing schools, high taxes, and what many say has been historically ill-distributed representation in government between the wealthier north side of town and the poorer south side., , Those who supported the charter argued that a city form of government could better address these problems and improve accountability. The now-city attempted a few times to change parts of the town government structure without changing the form of government altogether, which didn’t address all of the problems, said Charter Commissioner Adam Blumer., “We put in a stronger [town] manager, and a different size board of selectmen, and we still found that it wasn’t quite solving all the problems of governance that we wanted to solve,” he said. “There are some pretty complex issues that town meeting wasn’t able to deal with in a timely way.”, Town meeting had made other reforms as well, including voting in 2016 to reduce its members from 216 to 162 over the span of three years, with the goal of equalizing representation between the north and south sides of town. But these changes were never given a chance to play out, said town meeting member Mel Warshaw., “We finally got [this reform] through, and it was too late,” he said. “And it didn’t come across that the southern part of Framingham would now have more power.”, Framingham has held five votes on whether to become a city since 1913, and until this year, every effort failed. The last city charter before 2017, which was on the ballot in 1997, was voted down by a 2-1 margin., Framingham First was founded by town residents who were long-time proponents of making Framingham a city. Dennis Cardiff became the group’s treasurer and was also vice-chair of the charter commission. Cardiff was involved in the 1997 city charter movement and in another effort in 2014 to form a charter commission, which failed to get enough signatures to get on the ballot., The challenges they faced in 2014, he said, “would not be overcome unless we were able to organize a group of folks and find the donations to help get these signatures, so we organized Framingham First. … And Framingham First was organized to bring forward a charter movement to make Framingham a city.”, In two years, Framingham First raised nearly $90,000, which was unheard of in town politics, according to John Stasik, a former state representative and town selectman. Stasik is also the former chair of the Not This Charter campaign, a group opposed to Framingham becoming a city., “We never, never had an election that was anywhere near that,” he said. “Ten grand was a lot of money in Framingham to spend on an election. And, you know, we were so afraid that once we became a city that we were just going to be dealing with this whole … power, corruption, special interest thing.”, According to public campaign finance reports, of the nearly $90,000 that Framingham First raised between January 2015 and May 2017, at least $32,000 came from real estate or construction businesses, or leaders of such businesses. At least another $37,000 came from town businesses or leaders of town businesses., Cardiff said raising this amount of money and getting business support was key to the charter passing., “We did spend a lot of money to get [the charter] promoted and marketed, but I think that’s what it took to do it, and it was because Framingham First was a strong organization with its membership spanning across both residents and business owners. Business owners were key,” said Cardiff. “They became very active in the movement, and they’re still very active in the city movement. They felt they didn’t have a voice in government, and they wanted a voice.”, , Vaios Theodorakos, founder and chief executive officer of the real estate company VTT Management, which is headquartered in downtown Framingham and has bought and sold more than 300 properties in the now-city, donated a total of $6,500 to Framingham First. He has also donated the maximum allowed $1,000 to the Stefanini campaign. He said as a business and property owner, he found the town’s processes slow and difficult to navigate. , “It was fractured,” said Theodorakos. “You'd go in and talk about, you know, pulling a permit for something, then you'd go from one room, to another room, to another room, to another room, and there was no cohesion. There was nothing that was fluid.”, Theodorakos said he thinks this has slowed down the business growth and development that Framingham needs., Stasik said he agrees that more building and business in Framingham can be a good thing, as long as the impacted neighborhoods are given enough time to air their concerns about traffic, air quality and other considerations. That’s one thing he’s worried about., The Not This Charter Committee was formed in 2017. Critics of the city charter said they believe it consolidated too much power, increasing the potential for special interests to be put ahead of the needs of the residents., The pro-charter movement’s criticisms of town meeting, said Stasik, are valid. Before the charter was written, he favored Framingham becoming a city. But he said he has concerns that this specific city charter created a government that was too small, with a mayor with too much power., “It’s just that their solutions were far too … far too prone to special interests’ influences. That’s what bothers me about reducing the numbers too much,” Stasik said. “You cannot corrupt town meeting. You just can't. If you want something to go your way at town meeting, you have to convince 135 people to agree with you, and if you’re lobbying, that’s a very large number to lobby.”, Teri Banerjee, town meeting moderator and the lone charter commissioner who came out against the city charter, said she thinks moving things faster isn’t always better., “The Democratic process is not all that pretty, and it’s not all that efficient,” she said. “It's a curse of town meeting, and it's also one of the positives. … You get so many different points of view.”, Not This Charter raised approximately $8,000, almost entirely from small donations from Framingham residents. But with only a few months to organize, it was too late to stop their opponent’s momentum., “I think that if we would have been a little more efficient with our electioneering we might have … we might have prevailed in the end,” he said. “But there was no point in going down that road any further.”, The community was divided over the best path forward, just as it is today, said Cardiff., , “I believe there’s a very, very large divide,” he said. “That’s kind of indicated the fact that we have a lot of healing to do.”, Many of the contributors to Framingham First and Not This Charter are popping up again now. Many of the donors to Framingham First are supporting Stefanini, and many contributors to Not This Charter are supporting Spicer. There were approximately 57 donors to Framingham First listed on the group's campaign finance reports, and roughly half of these have also donated to the Stefanini campaign. Two have donated to Spicer, but those two donors also gave to Stefanini. Of the 36 listed donors that gave to Not This Charter, 28 donated to Spicer, and one gave to Stefanini, but that one donor also gave to Spicer. Donations of $50 or less are not required by law to be itemized on campaign finance reports., And, several campaign organizers overlap with either Framingham First or Not This Charter. For example, Mary Kate Feeney, the former chairwoman of Framingham First, is also the Stefanini campaign’s spokeswoman., Norma Shulman, a former member of Not This Charter, is also the Spicer campaign’s field organizer., “There are a few key members of the team who were part of Not This Charter,” said Shulman, “and people who have joined us because they want to see Yvonne Spicer be the first mayor.”, As Blumer points out, it’s not a one-to-one split. He cites himself as an example of this, as a supporter of Framingham becoming a city who is now supporting Spicer., And to a certain extent, each candidate wants to avoid being stereotyped by the overlapping contributions., The Stefanini campaign said it has assembled a diverse coalition that goes beyond Framingham First. ""John speaks to everyone — neighbors and local small businesses alike — and believes we need to come together and collaborate on the issues facing Framingham,"" his campaign said in a statement., Spicer echoed similar sentiments, noting that her team includes people on both sides of the city charter debate., ""The donations to my campaign reflect the people of Framingham,"" she said in an email. ""It's a grassroots campaign that has motivated people to get engaged, to come out and make a difference and have an impact on their local government.”, Though they may disagree on who will lead them in the right direction, both Spicer and Stefanini supporters agree that whatever the outcome of the election, what the community needs now is to move on and come together., ""The voters spoke,"" said Shulman, ""and therefore, we need to move forward to make [Framingham] the best city we can."", Who can best accomplish that task is what voters will decide Tuesday., Emily Judem is a digital producer for WGBH News.

One of the oldest and most respected book shows in the country, it showcases a wide range of antique collector's items, from maps and manuscripts to children's books. Henry Santoro spoke with longtime participant Ken Gloss, proprietor of Boston's Brattle Book Shop and appraiser on PBS's Antiques Roadshow, about what's in store for this year's fair., Henry Santoro: Ken, before we jump in and talk about this year's book fair, let's begin with this. I saw on social media that you recently acquired 13,000 books in one day., Ken Gloss: Thirteen thousand books, and that's not even that unusual. But yes, we went to Connecticut and we bought 13,000 books from one place, but a month before that we were in Buffalo, New York, and bought 11,000 books in another. And the logistics of moving those books — not only are they fun and it's a treasure hunt, and so on — and then you get down  — boy, they’re heavy., Henry Santoro: Oh, I'm sure. The Boston Antiquarian Book Fair kicks off this Friday night. It's a ticketed event, and then it's open to the public free of charge on Saturday and Sunday. Now, you know this event like the back of your hand. So what are some of the highlights for this year's fair?, Ken Gloss: Well, a few of the highlights  — and we have a bunch of speakers  — but there's a book, well it's more a pamphlet, it was almost a magazine that was published in the 1840s on West Street in Boston which happens to just be next door, but it was the first edition of civil disobedience by Thoreau. There's one item I really want to see. I haven't seen the material. Someone has an archive of a man named Dave Powers. Dave Powers was a great friend of John Kennedy. He was always at the White House. He was the first president of the Kennedy Library. Here's an archive — I haven't seen it yet, but I'm really anxious to see what's in it., Henry Santoro: He's got speeches and manuscripts and everything from Kennedy from going back to his earliest —, Ken Gloss: The earliest days and friends. There's a map of the Back Bay, but it's an interesting map. It's back in the 1840s, and it's an auction catalogue of the land in the Back Bay. And actually, the map showing the layout of the Back Bay was slightly different than what it turned out to be. And, you know, the corner of Boylston and Arlington Street, you could buy land for $2 a square foot., Henry Santoro: Do you see a shift? I mean, you deal with collectors all the time. Do you see a shift in trends when the cultural climate shifts?, Ken Gloss:  Yeah. You definitely see the politics change a little and people get a little bit more fervent on each side. So actually, some of the things that you might consider very extreme on one end and very extreme on the other, actually sometimes go up in price because the people are so passionate about it., Henry Santoro: So do you know yet what the ... Brattle bookshop will have in its booth?, Ken Gloss:  Well, I know — well, hopefully we won't have a lot at the end of the week, but we're bringing  — I know we have a not a first edition, but a slightly later edition of “Leaves of Grass,” that was inscribed by Walt Whitman., Henry Santoro: Boston's 41st International Antiquarian Book Fair is happening this coming weekend, Friday and Saturday and Sunday at the Hynes Convention Center.

275,[On The Waterfront: Jennifer Egan's New Novel Explores The World Of The 1940s Brooklyn Navy Yard],"[""A Visit From The Goon Squad,"" the 2011 novel that won Jennifer Egan the Pulitzer Prize, hops back and forth in time and perspective. But her latest novel, ""Manhattan Beach,"" is firmly rooted in a specific time and place: the world of the Brooklyn Navy Yard of the 1930s and 1940s. The novel focuses on a woman named Anna Kerrigan, who works at the Yard and eventually becomes the first female Navy diver., Egan stopped by Boston Public Radio to discuss her new novel and her writing process. An impartial transcript of their conversation follows., MARGERY EAGAN:  Give people a bit of an idea of what ""Manhattan Beach"" is about. , JENNIFER EGAN: It's set in the 30s and 40s in New York, and it follows a woman named Anna Kerrigan, who is 19 and one of the thousands of women who worked in industry during WWII. She works at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and ultimately becomes a diver. It's about her father, Eddie Kerrigan, who is sort of part of the Irish waterfront world, and a man named Dexter Styles, who is an organized crime boss. Their paths intersect more than once in different ways over time., JIM BRAUDE: Your level of expertise on everything from rescues to diving is immense. Then I listen to your NPR interview this morning in which you said essentially you didn't know anything about any of these things when you jumped in. What was the lure of this subject matter to you if it was all alien to you?, EGAN: That's such a good question, it's one of those things I only can try to analyze later. I really work so instinctively that I just have an urge toward a certain atmosphere, a time and a place. I was very interested in New York during World War Two. That really dates from 9/11, when New York really felt like a war zone overnight. I also, frankly, was thinking about the trajectory of American global power. 9/11 was clearly an event in that trajectory. We're still dealing with the ramifications of that. I was interested in the original forming of that power at the time when it coalesced. New York during the war led me to the waterfront because the port of New York was incredibly important because the Brooklyn Navy Yard was the largest builder and repairer of Allied ships during the war. Then the waterfront led me to diving. When I say 'led me,' I felt a kind of excitement I couldn't explain about these things and a desire to just live among them and spend my life getting to know them for a certain period., BRAUDE: Was getting to know them as exciting as the prospect of getting to know them?, EGAN: Initially, it was not! Initially, it was very hard because I knew nothing, and writing in a state of knowing nothing for some years...the level of incompetence troubled me. Once I crossed over into feeling comfortable and knowing enough that I could move around in the material, it really felt like time travel. It was really thrilling. It was like being able to fly., EAGAN: I didn't think of novelists doing as much reporting as you did for this piece. You write about trying on this diving suit because Anna was working as a diver. What was this Mark V diving suit?, EGAN: That was the diving suit anyone would recognize as sort of the iconic suit, with the spherical metal helmet, the big boots, the lead belt. It weighs 200 pounds. If you dreamed about a diver, that's what you would see in your dream. That's what was current heavy gear until the 1960s. I fell in with a group of Army diving veterans, and they meet every other year and one of the things they offer at their reunions is a chance for the guys — it was all men there — to wear the old equipment and dive in a tank. I've never even scuba dived, so no one was putting me in a tank, but they did dress me in the Mark V., EGAN: Could you walk?, EGAN: I took, I think, one step. It was very, very painful., EAGAN: Considering you wrote about someone who was, as you said, in a very male profession, I wonder what you've thought these last few weeks. We've been talking about all this sexual harassment of women in male professions. Did that resonate with you?, EGAN: It's fascinating to think about it in light of my research. For example, women had never worked in the Brooklyn Navy Yard before the war. Then they were beckoned in — the Rosie the Riveter campaign was a propaganda campaign to get women interested in working in industry. [When] women came in, initially, they were not allowed on ships, which is pretty incredible when you think about it — this is a Navy yard. They were welding and riveting and plumbing, but they couldn't go on ships because there was this fear that men and women together in these small spaces would result in bad things., Ultimately, they had to let the women on the ships because they needed them there. They were more limber, they were slighter, they could fit into the tight spaces of ships actually much better than men. But what it really speaks to was that, on the one hand, was discrimination, and on the other, there was a supposition that men could not be trusted and women had to be protected. What strikes me now is we don't have any of those protections anymore. That appears as exclusion — which it is — and yet a lot of the things they were worried about back in 1942 are still going on. This threatening atmosphere in the workplace clearly still exists., Click the audio player above to hear the interview.

277,[Top Donors In Boston Mayor's Race Are Often Close To City Business],"[The 2017 Boston mayoral race is about a number of key issues: affordability, schools, policing, race., It’s also about money., When it comes to the money that finances their campaigns, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and challenger City Councilor Tito Jackson stand on profoundly different ground: Walsh’s raised about $2.3 million in 2017 alone — more than nine times the funds raised by Jackson over the same time. Since becoming mayor, Walsh has raised close to $10 million in total.  , For both candidates, those donations come from a wide variety of donors, from retirees and homemakers to city employees to the principals of major area companies. , Companies can’t directly contribute to politicians in Massachusetts., But individuals do donate more than $200 are required to state their employer, and some of those companies stand out prominently among other donors — including companies that stood to benefit directly from decisions by city officials., A WGBH News analysis of campaign contributions to both Walsh and Jackson over the past four years shows that among the companies whose employees have made the most, and/or most numerous donations are companies that have, during that time, had business with the city., That’s true for both Walsh and Jackson — though more prominently so for incumbent Walsh., Top Donors, CBRE New England: Based in Boston with offices throughout New England, CBRE bills itself as the “largest full-service commercial real estate services company in New England.”, Among private employers, CBRE tops the list of combined employee donations to Walsh: Its employees made roughly 40 individual donations in each of the last four years, totaling just over $50,000. , The company has worked and continues to work for the Boston Planning and Redevelopment Authority (BPDA), serving as a marketing and leasing agent for BPDA properties and projects. CBRE is also engaged by the BPDA to help draw businesses to the city-owned Bolling Building, part of the city’s Dudley Square redevelopment project — which has struggled to draw and keep retailers. (That contact was first awarded in 2013, under former Mayor Thomas Menino.), Goulston &amp; Storrs: A major Boston-based law firm with a large real estate practice, Goulston &amp; Storrs employees have made more than one hundred donations to Walsh since 2014, totaling about $37,000., The company frequently represents development projects seeking approval, or relief, for example, from zoning restrictions, from the BPDA., At least one such project, a major redevelopment plan for the Landmark Center in Fenway is currently under review by the BPDA., Nixon Peabody, LLP: The Boston-based global law firm, whose employees donated a combined $38,000 to Walsh since 2014 made headlines last year when the Walsh administration hired one its lawyers, attorney Brian Kelly, a former federal prosecutor, to conduct an internal review after two of Walsh’s top aides were indicted on charges of attempted extortion., The city has paid about $300,000 to the firm for outside legal counsel., City officials confirm that Kelly continues to work for city departments to oversee policies and provide ethics trainings for city employees., Feeney Brothers Excavation, LLC: A Dorchester-based contractor, Feeney Brothers comes in fourth among companies whose employees donated the most to Walsh — a combined $28,000 since 2014., The company holds a contract for snow removal services for Boston — a contract it won through a 2014 bid, and which lasts through 2018. City data shows that the company has been paid about $4.7 million for snow removal since 2015., Suffolk Construction: The mega-contractor behind much of the major development around the city, Suffolk Construction employees have donated just shy of $23,000 to Walsh since 2014., The company does not contract directly with the city; but it has gotten substantial business from city-sanctioned development projects, including one prominent project being overseen, in part, by the BPDA: the estimated $200 million redevelopment of GE’s Boston headquarters., Two of the above companies (as well as many more whose employees contributed smaller sums) also made substantial corporate donations to the MJW Chartiable Foundation, Walsh’s personal nonprofit charity, which raises money via an annual golf tournament and donates proceeds to various local causes., Feeney Brothers contributed between $2,501 to $5,000 to the mayor’s foundation. Suffolk Construction contributed between $15,000 and $25,000 to foundation — just two among many larger contributors., Donations to Walsh’s Challenger, City Councilor Tito Jackson, also show specific employers whose combined donations rise above the rest., Roxbury-based developer Urban Core Development, whose employees donated a combined $4,000 to Jackson over four years; and The Community Builders, whose employees donated a combined $2,700 over that time., Compliance versus Appearance, There is no restriction on a candidate or sitting politician’s accepting donations from individuals or groups of individuals who may have business before the city., And while state ethics laws require disclosure in certain circumstances, the mere fact of a donation does not, generally, trigger disclosure rules. , The city could adopt stricter rules for its own employees, but no such proposals have emerged., Dan Weiner, a Senior Counsel at the Washington D.C.-based Brennan Center, and who specializes in issues around money in politics, says it’s not uncommon to see the donor rolls of local officials heavy with contributions from individuals with a financial stake in city business., Local races tend to get less attention than national ones and draw from a much smaller pool of donor — “And therefore the donor pool ends up being composed of people who do business with the city,"" Weiner said., Such donations are common and don’t by themselves imply favoritism. But even the potential for the appearance of something special treatment, he said, is problematic — even if the donations themselves are fully legal., “We would probably look askance at a politician accepting a personal gift, like a Ferrari or a Rolex from someone who worked for a government contractor,” Weiner said. “If you had a politician saying, ‘Well, you know, that individual gave me a Rolex but that didn’t affect my decision,' we would all maybe roll our eyes a little bit.”, WGBH News reached out to both campaigns , as well as the Mayor’s Press Office, with questions about these findings and whether the fact of a donor’s employer having open business before the city ever affects whether that donation is accepted., Walsh’s campaign responded to WGBH News’ findings and a series of questions with a statement reading (in whole): “The Walsh Campaign regularly reviews all campaign contributions and consults with the Office of Campaign and Political Finance to ensure compliance with laws, regulations, and standards.”, In a separate statement, the Mayor’s Press Office said that “No donations, whether political or charitable, influence the Mayor’s decision-making on city business.”, City Councilor Tito Jackson’s mayoral campaign also responded to similar questions as well as WGBH News’ findings., “This is why I am running for mayor,” Jackson wrote in a statement, taking aim at Walsh. “Mayor Walsh constantly pays lip-service to accountability and transparency and as we’ve seen on so many issues, has taken no action.”, Jackson pointed to Walsh’s pledge, when elected to his first term, to require public disclosure of lobbying of city officials (such disclosure is mandatory at the state level, but not in Boston)., Walsh has yet to institute such a reform, though he did, earlier this year, file a home rule petition to create new disclosure requirements., Jackson also said that if elected, he would create an Ethics Commission, a pledge Walsh himself made during his first year in office., Earlier this year, WGBH News reported that an “Ethics Committee” announced by Walsh in 2014 had initially convened, but then had quietly ceased activity: One appointee resigned after, he told WGBH News, he had been aware of no meetings or activity at all after an initial meeting. , Clarification: This story has been updated to better reflect Mayor Marty Walsh's role with respect to the home rule petition on the public disclosure of lobbying city officials., Isaiah Thompson is a staff reporter for WGBH News.

278,[WGBH News' Tina Martin Moderates Final Debate Of Framingham's Mayoral Race],"[BARBARA HOWARD: Framingham is getting ready to choose its first mayor. The two candidates for Framingham mayor, Yvonne Spicer and John Stefanini, squared off for the last time ahead of Tuesday's election in a debate that was moderated by WGBH Radio's Tina Martin, and she is here with me in the studio. Hi, Tina., TINA MARTIN: Hi there, Barbara., BARBARA HOWARD: So how did it go?, TINA MARTIN: It actually went very well. I think that this is the last in a slew of debates between the two of them, so I think that both candidates, Yvonne Spicer and John Stefanini, have kind of gotten into a swing, you know, they've kind of gotten into a flow. Both candidates got their points in on education, taxes, and working with small and large businesses. This forum was actually co-sponsored by the Metro West Chamber of Commerce, along with MetroWest Daily News, so there was a focus on business. And for those who don't know about Framingham, they are home to large companies like Bose, Staples, TJX, but they also have many smaller mom-and-pop type companies. And so one of the questions was how are you going to spark economic development and make sure that you balance the two? Because larger companies, maybe, have different concerns than smaller ones. So let's start with John Stefanini on how he's going to spark economic development in the city:, (SOUND CLIP OF DEBATE), JOHN STEFANINI: What I will do is I will convene business leaders, folks that I work with and know and have partnered with for a very long time. I’ll reach out to people I’ve worked with in the state who are part of the economic development conversation., TINA MARTIN: And, of course, that's John Stefanini referring to his years as a state representative, he was also a town selectman. Here's Yvonne Spicer on economic development:, (SOUND CLIP OF DEBATE), YVONNE SPICER: We’re going to have to change the message here in Framingham, that we're not the difficult place to do business in. We hit the reset button, on day one, to say yes we are open to business, yes we are welcoming., BARBARA HOWARD: What are the biggest concerns for Framingham voters?, TINA MARTIN: So the biggest concerns, really it's one big concern, from what I understand from voters, it’s schools. Framingham has four underperforming schools in the city, and many parents are concerned, many teachers are concerned, many people in the business community are even concerned. So one of the questions I asked of the candidates, both candidates today, was how are they going to involve the business community in an effort to improve those schools. And here is Yvonne Spicer:, (SOUND CLIP OF DEBATE), YVONNE SPICER: One of the ideas I certainly feel is a great one is to adopt a school — is to look to our businesses in the community, each one of these underperforming schools, you’re going to adopt them and have a relationship., TINA MARTIN: And John Stefanini has a very different perspective. Let's listen to what he says:, (SOUND CLIP OF DEBATE), JOHN STEFANINI: What are other communities doing in this area? High quality universal early childhood education. Look at other communities, look at education studies. We need to make sure that 4-year-olds have an equal opportunity to succeed., BARBARA HOWARD: Well it sounds pretty civil there. In previous debates, there’s been a little heat, I understand, between the two candidates. What happened this time?, TINA MARTIN: You know what, this time was fantastic. Both of them shook hands in the beginning and the end of the forum, and they were both allowed their three minutes. No one interrupted anyone. So today was very smooth. You know, hopefully by Tuesday people will be able to make a decision on who they want as their mayor., BARBARA HOWARD: Well it should be noted that if Yvonne Spicer were to win, there is historical significance to that., TINA MARTIN: So Yvonne Spicer, if she's elected, she would be the second popularly elected African-American mayor in the state, only to follow Setti Warren in Newton. There is some confusion because Denise Simmons, who is also African-American, is the mayor in Cambridge, but she is elected by the city council. , BARBARA HOWARD: An important distinction. Thanks for joining us, Tina., TINA MARTIN: Thank you very much. , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. , Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"
279,[Which Companies' Employees Are Donating To Marty Walsh And Tito Jackson?],"[BARBARA HOWARD: Campaigning for mayor of Boston costs money. WGBH Radio's Isaiah Thompson set out to trace the source of campaign funds. He's with me in the studio. Hi, Isaiah., ISAIAH THOMPSON: Hi, Barbara., BARBARA HOWARD: So you look not just at individuals, but at companies financing the Boston mayoral runs between the sitting mayor, Marty Walsh, and his challenger, City Councilor Tito Jackson. Tell me what you found., ISAIAH THOMPSON: Right. So, it's important for us to point out that corporations, companies, cannot make donations to political candidates — only individuals can, but individuals who donate more than $200 do have to disclose who their employer is. And what I found is, if you step back, you take a look at the employers that turn up the most often in this data, you see distinct patterns. You see companies whose employees have made lots of donations year after year totaling large sums of money., BARBARA HOWARD: Are you saying it's in a concerted way that somebody is actually orchestrating this? I mean, how do you know?, ISAIAH THOMPSON: No, there's no way to know that. I mean, in fact, companies are not allowed to sort of reimburse, for example, that would be illegal. But what we do see is a lot of individuals, often owners, you know, high up people — not always — from these companies really making, you know, contributions year after year for large amounts of money and sometimes totaling tens of thousands of dollars., BARBARA HOWARD: So which companies come to mind?, ISAIAH THOMPSON: So, a few examples. One would be CBRE New England. They're one of the biggest real estate firms around and their employees have made more donations to Walsh over time than those of any other private company. In this case, as in other cases I looked at, this is a company that also has direct business with the city. For example, CBRE has an arrangement with the Boston Redevelopment Authority to market its properties and to do some leasing work for them. Now that started under former Mayor Menino, I should point out, but that contract, that arrangement, has continued under Mayor Walsh., BARBARA HOWARD: And are there any other companies?, ISAIAH THOMPSON: Yes. Just to give one more, there's a company called Feeney Brothers. Their employees made a total of about $20,000 in donations to Walsh over the last four years. That company has been paid millions of dollars in a snow removal contract for the city., BARBARA HOWARD: OK, so, but this is not just about Mayor Walsh, right?, ISAIAH THOMPSON: No, and in fact, if you look at the companies whose employees have donated the most to Walsh’s challenger, Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson, you will also find a few real estate companies who have had projects that needed approval from the Redevelopment Authority. Now, of course, one difference there is that Jackson doesn't appoint the Redevelopment Authority, Walsh does. Walsh and Jackson have both said that these donations don't influence their decisions. And it's important to remember, in the big scheme of things, these are still pretty small portions of the money that either of them has raised. But there is still the question of appearances., BARBARA HOWARD: Have you had a chance to talk to either Walsh or Jackson about your findings?, ISAIAH THOMPSON: Yeah, I reached out to both campaigns. The Walsh campaign sent a statement saying, in essence, that they review all contributions and that they are in full compliance with the law. Tito Jackson sent a statement critical of Mayor Walsh. He pointed out that Walsh promised to make city lobbying activity public when he came into office. That still hasn't happened, although Walsh did get behind a plan to do that earlier this year., BARBARA HOWARD: OK, thanks for joining us, Isaiah., ISAIAH THOMPSON: Thanks for having me., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

Michael Capuano responded to the release of a proposed new Republican tax plan, a $1.51 trillion rewrite that would significantly cut taxes for corporations and modest savings for the middle-class that Capuano described as “hypocrisy on steroids.”, “I have this idea that maybe we should be fiscally responsible and pay for the things that we want,” Capuano said in an interview with Boston Public Radio Thursday. “However, that’s apparently not what we’re about to do, we’re about to make it worse.”, The House version contains two controversial issues that Capuano fears could have a negative impact on the economy: a partial repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which many lawmakers say would hurt their constituents who rely on the provision, and a measure that would limit Americans' abilities to use their 401(k)s for retirement., “I don’t mind juicing up the economy when it’s necessary,” Capuano said. “When the economy took a hit, I thought the bailout that we did and the stimulus that we did, I didn’t like them, but I thought they were necessary at the time to maintain the economy … but the economy is doing okay at the moment!”, “At the moment, I don’t see the need,” Capuano continued. “The economy is doing well, the unemployment rate is amongst historic lows … in general, we’re doing okay. This is not necessary to goose up the economy, and I think we have other needs in our society that need to be addressed.”, To listen to Rep. Michael Capuano’s full interview with Boston Public Radio, click on the audio player above. , Tori Bedford (she/her/hers) is a reporter at WGBH News and produces the All Rev’d Up podcast.

286,"[Artificial Intelligence May Not Kill Your Job, But It Could Change How You Do It]","[As artificial intelligence technology becomes more advanced and common, some might be concerned that it might replace us at work. At an MIT conference on the subject this week, scientists and leaders of some of the world’s top tech companies say while A.I. isn’t likely to put you out of a job, it may change the nature of what work means., At the conference, titled “A.I. and the Future of Work,” MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson reminded attendees that this isn’t the first time we’ve seen things change quickly. The greatest change in technology, he said, came at the beginning of the 20th century., “The technology that really triggered the industrial revolution was all about augmenting our muscles,"" he said. ""The steam engine, later the electric dynamo, the internal combustion engine. They basically brought more and more power to us to be able to shift around the physical world.”, Today, he said, we’re in the early stages of another transformation. “We're using technologies to augment not just our muscles but our brains, allowing us to control the world and make them figure things out more effectively.”, And of course, just as robots in factories have driven many workers to unemployment lines, Krystyn Van Vliet of MIT points out some are concerned A.I. could lead to all kinds of other jobs becoming obsolete., “That may be the case and certain tasks,"" Van Vliet said. ""But there are many, many tasks that it will not be the case for."", Earlier in the conference, she said, she spoke with a radiologist who's developing A.I work at Massachusetts General Hospital., ""[He] said this would absolutely not lead to fewer radiologists in the foreseeable future of his lifetime because what is now being able to be done by computers gives the doctors now actually time to consult with each other and consult with their patients, which they currently don't have the time to do.”, Moshe Vardi of Rice University pushed back a bit on that idea, saying more efficiency — in a medical setting or in a school — doesn’t necessarily mean more quality time together, since everyone’s under pressure. “How many patients do you see per hour? How many students are you, are you handling?” he said., Automation, Vardi said, is an enabler. We can decide that by automating the grading exams, it enables teachers to have more teaching time with students. “Or, we could decide that we need fewer teachers and full physical therapies. That's our choice. It's not technology. That's on us,” he said., Among the industry leaders at the conference was Allen Blue, the co-founder of LinkedIn. He said in Denver, medical coders are in high demand — a job he said is likely to become automated. “What do we do when we have a system which basically says, ‘hey, you can go get trained as a medical coder, because there’s lots of demand for it, but in three years that job may not exist?’”, Blue said he’s not sure what the answer is., “What we do know is that one of the major things which is going to be part of it is lifelong education. You’re going to have to re-skill over and over again, in order to be able to keep up with changes as you go,” he said. He added that LinkedIn would like bring jobs and education together in one place, so people see a job they’re interested in, along with a training program to prepare them for it., It should be no surprise that one company developing artificial intelligence tools is Alphabet – the company formally known by its biggest business: Google. The company’s CEO Eric Schmidt told the crowd at the MIT conference that as A.I. becomes a bigger part of our work lives, the 40-hour work week will become a thing of the past., “So one argument is that as people become more productive through automation, they will work fewer hours for same or greater income and be happier,"" Schmidt said. ""The limit to me to that argument ... I think this is missed by most economists, is that for most people work is identity, and identity is very important. So in order for the workweek to materially decline as a percentage of people's life, they're going to have to have things aside from internet surfing and playing with video games,"" he said. ""How do I make the world a better place? How do I serve others?”, It's a question we may all have to think about, as computers start doing even more of the thinking for us, and we find ourselves with time on our hands. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

295,[Bristol Community College Students Place Bets On Casino Education],"[Listen here for a radio version of this story. , At the Silver City Galleria in Taunton, retail has been a losing game. First, JC Penney folded. Then Macy’s. Yet deep inside what was once an Old Navy store, Bristol Community College is betting big on the promise of another industry: casinos., “The casinos are going to hire 10,000 people in the Commonwealth and the college said, 'Let’s start training people for those jobs,'” said Paul Robillard, an instructor at the school’s newly-opened casino lab., Certified by the state gaming commission, the lab houses tables for poker, roulette, craps and blackjack. About a dozen students watch as Robillard demonstrates the finer points of dealing cards., “Up, underneath,” he says as he picks cards off the green felt covered table. “Up, underneath.”, Dimly lit with a brightly colored rug on the floor, the lab feels like a tiny casino. Mirrored security cameras hang above the gaming tables, and a room next to the lab houses surveillance equipment. , “You can teach virtually anyone,” said Robillard, who spent four years dealing cards at Foxwoods Casino in Connecticut. “It’s not a complicated game.”, Casinos are Robillard’s second career.  He’s a former Red Cross executive and longtime business professor at Bristol Community College. Like many others, he saw the advent of casinos as a game changer for Massachusetts’ southeastern corner., “Bristol County — the average salary, the average income — is really low. So, it’s an opportunity for people to get good jobs, and the casinos have good benefits, too,” said Robillard. “The dealers will make $40-$50,000 a year, including tips, and it’s up from there.”, If all had gone as planned, casino jobs would be available right in the neighborhood. The Mashpee Wampanoag tribe had already broken ground on a casino when they lost a federal court case challenging their right to the land. Both the case and the future of a casino in this part of the state remain in limbo., “We would have rather seen that the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe was successful and would have had their casino built by now,” said Robillard. ""That certainly would have been more advantageous to the folks in southeastern Massachusetts.”, Students who learn how to get into the casino game here in Taunton may not stick around. Casinos now under construction in Everett and Springfield are more than an hour away.  , “People, if they’re really interested in it and want to start a career, it’s like any other corporation — you've got to move,"" said Robillard., There are casinos operating in nearby Rhode Island, although they’re not nearly the size of the one imagined for Taunton or the casino resorts now under construction in Everett and Springfield. Still, student Mary Hanning is hopeful that a casino proposed for Tiverton, Rhode Island opens. It’s right across the bridge from her home in Fall River., “I think it would be interesting to get in on the ground floor of something that dynamic,” said Hanning. , The casino class is part of a larger hospitality program. Students can earn an associate’s degrees with a concentration not only in casino management, but also tourism and culinary arts. They are all skills sure to be in high demand, just not close to home. , Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"
296,[Do You Know The Saint Who Gave Boston Its Name?],"[Nov. 1 is All Saints Day — a day set aside for Catholics and many Protestants to honor “all of the saints, known and unknown.” Most of us, Catholic or not, probably know a saint or two — maybe St. Patrick or St. Francis of Assisi. But the vast majority of these curiously venerated men and woman toil in obscurity, from St. Anacletus, the Church’s third pope, to St. Zebinus, a 5th century Syrian hermit and teacher of monks, including Saints Maro and Polychronius, whoever they were., But if there’s one little-known saint that should be more well-known around here, it’s St. Botolph of Thorney., “He’s the patron saint of travelers,” said Peter Van Demark, a member of the St. Botolph Club, a private social club in the Back Bay, located — perhaps not incidentally — about a mile from St. Botolph Street., Like me and countless owners of St. Christopher medals, you may have been under the impression that St. Christopher was the patron of travelers. , “Well there really was a St. Botolph,” said Van Demark. “There really wasn’t a St. Christopher. He was a fiction.”, Not much is known about St. Botolph. We’re not even 100 percent sure exactly where or when he was born. It was around 620, somewhere in Great Britain., “Possibly in Kent, possibly in East Anglia or possibly in Scotland,” said Van Demark.  , What we do know is that he was a Benedictine monk who traveled England in the 7th Century, preaching Christianity. We have a sense of where he traveled, because many of the communities of Christians that he established named their churches after him, and there’s a whole bunch of St. Botolph’s churches throughout England. But the biggest, most important of these churches lies on the southeast coast., “It’s a parish church, but it’s so big it looks like a cathedral,” said Van Demark. “It’s called the stump because its tower doesn’t go to a point.”, So, what does any of this have to do with us?, Well that big church is in Boston, Lincolnshire — a place so important to the Puritans that they named a town here after it. And crucially, it’s believed today that the word ""Boston"" itself is a contraction of that place’s original name: Botolph’s Town., “Nobody can say that Boston is St. Botolph’s Town, but people do the research, and because Boston has a church named after St. Botolph that makes a very strong connection,"" Van Demark said. , St. Botolph may have given Boston its name, but he’s no home-grown saint. In fact, less than a handful of the more than 10,000 Catholic saints were born in the U.S., none of them in New England — though Sister Mary Joseph isn’t so sure about that. She believes one has: Mother Mary Alphonsa, who was born in Lennox, Massachusetts in 1851 as Rose Hawthorne. You might have heard of Rose’s father, Nathaniel Hawthorne, who wrote — among other things — the Scarlet Letter., “We’re the Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne,” said Sister Mary Joseph. “Our work is to care for people who are terminally ill with cancer.”, Rose Hawthorne grew up in New England and Europe, married writer George Parsons Lathrop at age 19, and —along with her husband — converted to Catholicism in the late 1800s., “It was big news,” said Sister Mary Joseph. “It was in all the papers. The secular papers and the religious papers.”, But their marriage was a tumultuous affair. Their only child, a daughter, died of diphtheria at the age of 5 and Lathrop struggled with alcoholism. They separated in 1895. Three years later, he died.  , “So, she was 45 and she was looking for something to do with her life,” said Sister Mary Joseph. “She always had this sense that she wanted to be of use.”, Hawthorne found her calling in New York City, where she was moved by the plight of poor cancer patients. At the time, they were being quarantined, often in terrible conditions., “A fire was lighted in her heart, she said, to devote her life to those poor people diagnosed with cancer who really had no one else or no place to go,” said Sister Mary Joseph., Hawthorne took a nursing course at the New York Cancer hospital, moved to a tenement building on the lower east side, and began her work — free of charge.   , “She said, ‘I wanted to be of the poor and for the poor,’” said Sister Mary Joseph. “She just started taking care of anyone who needed her.”, Hawthorne took her vows as a Catholic nun and, in 1900, founded her own order. In 2013, the church officially named Hawthorne a “Servant of God,” the first in a four-step process to Catholic sainthood. Currently, Hawthorne’s life is under review at the Vatican in Rome., “Eventually, we hope we’ll declare that she did live a life of heroic virtue,” explained Sister Mary Joseph. , That’s step two — veneration. Step three, beatification, would require proof that a miracle had been performed by Hawthorne, or in her name., “I don’t want to say too much about it — kind of at this early stage. But there is one where we believe she did intervene and save the life of a baby,” said Sister Mary Joseph., To move from beatification to sainthood, canonization, is a long road, and would literally take, among other things, another miracle. Perhaps impossible for you or me but, then again, most of us are no saints., As always, I want to hear about what has piqued your curiosity lately. Email me at CuriosityDesk@wgbhnews.org and let me know. I might just look into it for you. , An earlier version of this article described All Saints Day as a Catholic holy day and has since been updated. Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists and a number of other Protestant denominations also observe All Saints Day. , Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"

Lynch: State, Local Tax Break, 401k Provision 'Enough To Bring Down' GOP Tax Plan]","[UPDATE: Late Tuesday evening, Republicans announced they would postpone revealing what's in the tax bill until Thursday. “In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday,"" said Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, in a statement. ""We are pleased with the progress we are making, and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our committee beginning next week.”,  , It’s been a crazy week in Washington. In the midst of three federal indictments, new revelations about the Russian election dossier, and a Halloween costume parade, House Republicans are still struggling with the details of a new tax plan that was expected to be unveiled Wednesday., With less than 24 hours to go, few details have emerged, including plans to lower the cap on 401(k) contributions, repealing the state and local tax deduction, limiting the estate tax, and a highly contentious proposal to raise taxes for millionaires — something that might deviate from the Republican brand., “Look, the Democrats want to raise taxes, and really create obstruction, and the Republicans want to lower taxes and we want to get rid of regulations,” President Trump told reporters at the White House Tuesday. “I’ve gotten rid of more regulations in the first nine months than any president has for their term in office. That’s a big statement, but we’ve really just begun.”, The question remains — will all this hubbub in the White House impact the president’s agenda?, Rep. Stephen Lynch joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on Boston Public Radio Tuesday to discuss., “There’s still some major disagreement within the Republican caucus, that’s been one of the problems we have here,” Lynch said. “We can’t really engage in a dialogue of potential compromise, because we get the White House version, then we get the [House Speaker] Paul Ryan version, and then we get the Freedom Caucus version of how they see things.”, “Sometimes it’s difficult to discern which version is actually going to be put into the legislation,” Lynch continued. “Right now, we have been given very little information and very little meaningful detail with respect to this proposal that’s supposed to be dropped tomorrow.”, According to Lynch, two key issues could have the power to stop the GOP tax plan in its tracks: a partial repeal of the state and local tax deduction, which many lawmakers say would hurt their constituents who rely on the provision, and a measure that would limit Americans' abilities to use their 401(k)s for retirement., “Those two are enough to bring the bill down if they don’t address it,"" Lynch said. ""So we’ll have to see what’s in the details tomorrow.”, To hear Rep.

312,"[Money And Politics: Whatever The City, Corporate Interests And Out-Of-Towners Dominate]","[	 
	For anyone following the Boston mayoral election, one truth has been hammered ad-nauseum: Incumbent mayor Marty Walsh, challenged in this election by Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson, has raised a lot more campaign money than his opponent — a war chest millions of dollars strong, compared to a couple hundred thousand dollars raised by opponent Jackson.
	 
	Boston is in many ways unique in the extent to which it exerts a kind of gravitational pull on political activity — and political money -- not just in Greater Boston, but indeed throughout New England. 
	 
	But campaign finance data from races in smaller cities shows that campaign finance patterns that hold true in Boston politics are not unique to the city. 
	 
	WGBH News took a look at races in nearby smaller cities and found, often, that the same patterns describing political contributions in the big-time arena of Boston politics hold true in sleepier elections elsewhere.  
	 
Incumbent Advantage:
	 
	There are many political advantages enjoyed by incumbent mayors, ranging from simple name recognition to the fact that they a potential army of political supporters is, literally, in their employ. 
	 
	Incumbents also tend to raise more money than their challengers — often by orders of magnitude. 
	 
	In Lawrence, incumbent mayor Daniel Rivera faces challenger William Lantigua, a former mayor and well known maverick.
	 
	Rivera's fundraising in 2017 alone outpaced that of his rival by a factor of more than five — over one hundred thousand dollars to less than $15,000 raised by insurgent Lantigua.
	 
	In Brockton, mayoral challenger Jimmy Pereira has raised just over $5,000 — compared to about $88,000 raised by incumbent mayor Bill Carpenter.
	 
	The city of Lynn, however, provides an interesting exception to, or perhaps variation on, the rule: Incumbent mayor Judith Flanagan Kennedy, a rarity in Bay State municipal politics – Republican, a has raised substantially less in campaign contributions than her opponent for the mayor's seat, sitting state senator Thomas McGee, a Democrat who is the son of the former House Speaker of the same name.

314,[Sexual Harassment Reports Spur House To Review Its Policies ],"[Speaker Robert DeLeo on Friday ordered a comprehensive review of the Massachusetts House's sexual harassment policies, saying the body may have failed in its endeavor to create a positive work environment for all., The order, directing House counsel to analyze ""existing policies and practices designed to prevent and properly address sexual harassment and retaliation in the workplace"" came after the Boston Globe published a column based on interviews with a dozen women recounting their experiences with sexual harassment in the State House., The women — activists, aides, lobbyists and lawmakers who asked that their names not be used, according to the column — told of instances involving men who had left politics and some who are still in office who inappropriately touched them, made sexual remarks, or otherwise harassed them., The House was meeting in a rare Friday session to work on a spending bill and leaders held their session open for hours before gaveling in just before 3 p.m. Speaking from the House floor, DeLeo said he was ""infuriated and deeply disturbed"" to hear of the women's allegations. He said he understood the desire to remain anonymous but said it was upsetting that women feared the consequences of reporting harassment., ""I want to assure all members, employees and visitors to the House of Representatives that the House of Representatives has a zero-tolerance policy for harassment of any form and has and will continue to thoroughly investigate any reported incident of harassment and take decisive and appropriate action to discipline offenders and to protect victims,"" DeLeo said., The issue of sexual harassment, particularly in the workplace, became a national conversation earlier this month after more than a dozen women accused film executive Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment., DeLeo said the House has tried to create a ""positive work environment"" for all., ""To hear that we may have failed is deeply troubling to me,"" the Winthrop Democrat said. ""To know that, as recent headlines suggest, we are not alone, provides no comfort."", Women in the Globe column detailed various incidents, including one where House lawmakers viewed pornography on a cellphone in the chamber, and another in which a representative who is no longer in office crudely told a Senate aide he wanted to have sex with her., Under DeLeo's order, House chief legal counsel James Kennedy has until March 1, 2018 to report on House policies and recommend updates ""to instill a culture of accountability focused on ensuring a professional and safe working environment for all members, officers, employees and guests of the House."", The order instructs House attorneys to ""act independently"" of lawmakers, officers and employees of the House in their review and authorizes them to retain outside legal experts and consultants., When complete, the report will be posted on the Legislature's website and made available electronically to all House members and staff., With 63 women and 133 men currently in office, women account for less than one-third of the Legislature's membership. There are 12 women in the 40-seat Senate, and 51 in the 160-seat House., Rep. Sarah Peake, a member of DeLeo's leadership team, said she has not experienced sexual harassment on Beacon Hill and that DeLeo has a record ""of providing a fair and safe place to work."", ""This is in the news these days. I think it's great that it's in the news,"" Peake said after session. ""It is causing lots of women to search back through their memory banks, and say, 'Hey, maybe that incident that happened to me when I was a teenager and had a job at the ice cream shop and I laughed off at the time was really not laughable.'"", Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito, a former House lawmaker, told the News Service she feels ""fortunate"" to have not faced a circumstance like the ones described in the column., ""This is a problem in society that needs to be elevated, and if it's by individuals coming forward to tell their stories so that we can all work together to make it a safer and healthier place for individuals, then we should do that,"" said Polito, who chairs the Governor's Council on Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence., House Minority Leader Brad Jones issued a statement saying he strongly endorses the policy review and is ""ready to assist in any way possible."", In the Senate, all employees and lawmakers receive anti-harassment training at the beginning of each session, Senate President Stanley Rosenberg said in a statement., ""Moreover, harassment complaints are promptly investigated by Senate Counsel and the Director of Senate Human Resources. If the allegations are supported, appropriate discipline is imposed,"" Rosenberg said. ""Given the seriousness of this issue and current events, the Senate has been planning a series of events to continue to raise awareness within the body and remind all members and staff of the procedures that exist to protect against harassment and encourage their use when appropriate."", Any reports of sexual harassment in the House would be brought to the attention of DeLeo, Kennedy and House human resources director Keith Johnson, according to Rep. Paul Donato, the House's second assistant majority leader., Donato said DeLeo wants to ""strengthen"" the policies around sexual harassment so that they are understood by all lawmakers and to ""ensure that those who are sexually harassed have the opportunity to go through the process, through HR and whatever process it is after that, to ensure that they are in a very, very safe area for working."", [Andy Metzger contributed reporting]]"

Economic Growth Rate Surges To Nearly 6 Percent],"[While consumer spending has been ""surprisingly weak,"" the Massachusetts economy jolted forward in the third quarter, with real gross domestic product surging 5.9 percent and employment growth also outpacing the national rate, according to a new report., MassBenchmarks, an economic journal published by the UMass Donahue Institute with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, reported Friday that employment in the second quarter grew by a 2.1 percent annual rate in Massachusetts, compared to 1.2 nationally., The 5.9 percent third quarter real GDP growth rate followed a 4.9 percent pace in the second quarter in Massachusetts, and 1.1 percent in the first quarter., Looking ahead, the MassBenchmarks Leading Economic Index estimates the state economy is expected to continue growing, but at lower annualized rates — 3.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 3 percent in the first quarter of 2018., The growth comes amid fierce battles in Washington D.C. over the agenda being pushed by Republican President Donald Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress, and as lawmakers on Beacon Hill and Gov. Charlie Baker hope to break free from a prolonged period of slow growth in state tax revenues., The journal's authors, citing U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, reported real gross domestic product grew at a 3 percent annualized rate during the third quarter nationally, in part due to the drag on economic activity caused by Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, particularly in Texas and Florida., ""The Commonwealth exhibited very strong employment and earnings growth during the third quarter,"" according to MassBenchmarks, which estimated based on state withholding tax revenues that wage and salary income in Massachusetts grew at a 10.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, compared to a projected 3.8 percent national rate during the same period — a BEA estimate of national wage and salary income growth is scheduled for Monday., The Massachusetts unemployment rate in September was 3.9 percent, while the national rate was 4.2 percent., ""Despite these low unemployment rates and anecdotes about a shortage of workers, employment growth continues unabated without clear signs of wage rate pressures,"" Alan Clayton-Matthews, MassBenchmarks senior contributing editor and an economics professor at Northeastern University, said in a statement. ""It may be that the rapid growth in wage and salary income in Massachusetts is signaling the beginning of an acceleration in wage rates, but it's too early to tell. Tax revenues can fluctuate from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons that do not reflect an underlying trend."", After getting burned by overly optimistic tax revenue estimates the last two fiscal years, Baker and the Legislature are hoping for a rebound in revenues in fiscal 2018. Over the first three months, collections are beating expectations but Baker remains wary and this week said he's not going to release funding for projects earmarked in the state budget by lawmakers until he's more comfortable with the state's financial position., The MassBenchmarks report offered evidence that might support a cautious spending approach., As measured by regular sales tax receipts and motor vehicle sales taxes, spending has been ""surprisingly weak given strong income growth and the surging stock market,"" the report said. Spending on taxable items declined in the third quarter by 3.3 percent, and grew by just 1.7 percent between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2017., In an interview, Clayton-Matthews said the state's recent economic growth rates have been propelled by employment growth, rising wages and salaries, and an increase in productivity., ""Productivity is output per worker,"" he said, noting better capital or more skills can increase productivity. Increased business investments in machinery, he said, may have been a factor in boosting productivity recently., From September 2016 to September 2017, Massachusetts has added 62,300 jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics., ""I'm pleasantly surprised, I guess, that the state is still able to add jobs at the rate that it has been adding throughout this recovery in the face of what has been anecdotal accounts of difficulty finding workers,"" Clayton-Matthews said, speculating Massachusetts may be pulling workers from neighboring states.]"

319,[High School Golfer Calls For Change After Female Tournament Winner Denied Trophy],"[BARBARA HOWARD: On Tuesday, high school golfer Emily Nash of Lunenburg came in first at the Central Massachusetts Division Three Boys Golf Tournament in Uxbridge. That's right. It was a boys golf tournament. Lunenburg High School does not have a girls golf team, so Emily Nash plays on the boys team. But even though she had the best score at Tuesday's tournament, she was not awarded the first place trophy. Instead, it went to the second best scoring golfer, a boy. And that was Nico Ciolino of Marlborough's Advanced Math and Science Academy. He's with us on the line. Thanks for joining us, Nico., NICO CIOLINO: Yeah, no problem., BARBARA HOWARD: So according to state rules, Emily Nash could not be awarded the trophy and she cannot advance to next week's state tournament because she's a girl. Her score only counted toward the Lunenburg team's overall score in the tournament, and it should be noted that you, Nico Ciolino, you showed a lot of sportsmanship at Tuesday's tournament. Here's Emily Nash's account of what happened after you were given the first-place trophy., EMILY NASH: He offered the trophy to me, which was super nice and classy of him., BARBARA HOWARD: So Emily Nash ended up declining your offer. Tell me why did you offer the trophy to her., NICO CIOLINO: I offered it to her because in my eyes she was the winner no matter if she was a boy or a girl. At the end of the day that doesn't really bother me at all. I think it's the best golfer., BARBARA HOWARD: What was it like competing with her, was it any different?, NICO CIOLINO: In all my golf tournaments I always play with boys, because I'm in the boys division. Being paired up with a girl was a little bit different for me. I'm not sure how it was going to be going into it, but it felt like it was just a normal round to me. She was a great person, easy to talk to, a great golfer., BARBARA HOWARD: So put me back in the moment when they were making the awards and you were there. I mean did it put you in a tough spot, did it take the shine off your almost win?, NICO CIOLINO: I don't think that there was a shine on me. I think everyone knew that she won. I think if you were in the moment you realize that oh my goodness a great girl golfer just beat 57 guys. You know I don't think there was a sparkle, on me I thinktheret was a sparkle on her just because of how she played., BARBARA HOWARD: When the tournament was over did you talk with Emily? What was that exchange like?, NICO CIOLINO: I did talk to her. I went up to her. People were leaving and you know I told her with trophy in hand that this is yours. You won the tournament. She told me No no no no it's ok. You know, no it is really not ok. You won the tournament. This is yours. I'm not sure why they gave it to me. She was super kind about it. It was tough on her part because we golfers, I know I can speak for myself and my team and she can too. We work so hard for these things. So I felt 100 percent that the trophy should have been hers., BARBARA HOWARD: So you get to advance now next week to the state tournament. But Emily cannot. Do you have mixed feelings about that?, NICO CIOLINO: I do. Because she can't represent her school…I’m a little bit confused on why she can't go on to next Monday., BARBARA HOWARD: Next time you play if you win does it take the gloss off for you? Weil you always wonder what it would have been like had she been there?, NICO CIOLINO: I do or I would. I think that it's always tough to see the best golfer from Division 3, the Central Part, not to partake in the division 3 state tournament. And if she brought her A-game to states like she did districts you never know what could have happened. So I'm going to be wondering how she would have played that day just because she should be there., BARBARA HOWARD: What would you like the leaders of the MIAA, the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association…that's the organization that governs high school sports in the state, which has this girl rule in place - what would you like them to do?, NICO CIOLINO: I think that with her being a part of the boys team she should be able to play in districts and if she plays in districts she should be able to win the districts. They should allow her to play and allow her to win in districts or states or whatever tournament the MIAA runs. With this happening the MIAA is hopefully is going to see and fix what is wrong with their tournament., BARBARA HOWARD: Congratulations, Nico, on a well-played game and superior sportsmanship., NICO CIOLINO: Thank you., BARBARA HOWARD: That's Nico Celino, a golfer from Marlborough's Advanced Math and Science Academy. On Tuesday, se came in second at the Central Massachusetts Division Three Boys golf Tournament. Lunenburg’s Emily Nash came in first, but as a girl she could not collect the first place trophy thanks to state rules. WGBH News did reach out to the MIAA for comment…it issued a statement defending its rules noting that Emily Nash - referred to in the statement only as “Lunenburg’s female golfer” - can participate in a spring tournament for girls in which she is eligible for the first place trophy.,  , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

325,[Why Practice Rarely Makes Perfect],"[Mathematician Eugenia Cheng doesn’t believe much in perfectionism. Her philosophy: Why worry about something that’s unattainable?, “What is perfection?” Cheng muses. “I don’t think it exists, so I don’t think we can strive to achieve it.”, To clarify, when we talk about perfection, we’re talking about over-polishing work that is already really good. Like worrying about the fonts in your finished PowerPoint presentation, or doing some late-night proofreading of an essay that you’ve already edited 10 times., Cheng, a scientist-in-residence at the School of The Art Institute of Chicago, says that one of the main problems with striving for perfectionism is that, after a while, your diligent hard work levels off. Call it the law of diminishing returns.  , “The key is not just the outcome by itself, it’s the ratio of outcome to effort,” Cheng said. “If the amount of effort is small, and you get a really huge payoff, then sure. But at a certain point, the payoff starts getting less relative to the amount of effort. The best place to stop is once you start getting those diminishing returns.”, And you should figure out that stopping point out sooner rather than later. If you don’t, your diligence might actually create more issues than it’s solving. Indeed, that paper you stayed up editing until 4 a.m. might have a few more mistakes than when you started. Tired, overworked eyes can’t pick up on everything., So how do decide your minimum standards?, , One solution is to lower them, at least during certain parts of a project. Cheng says that when she’s writing or working, she just focuses on getting the first step done., “I don’t get writer’s block [when writing a first draft] because I’m not trying to aim for perfection, I’m just aiming to get something down,” Cheng said. “I do the same thing with a colleague during research. We say we’re just going to do something. Anything. It’s the final stages [where] diminishing returns can be really tricky.”, But Cheng’s favorite solution comes from her nephew, who made a motivational video for his little brother as he was starting kindergarten., “He said an amazingly wise thing. He said, ‘If you make a mistake, don’t worry about being perfect. As long as you have fun and do your best, you did perfect!’” Cheng said., Cheng thinks about this when she and her musical colleagues play at her music salon, the Liederstube., “We have a really great ratio of outcome to effort because we make practically no effort whatsoever,” Cheng said. “The outcome is not perfect in the sense of playing all the right notes or being correct all the time, but in a way, it’s perfect because we did our best and we had fun.”    , Marc Filippino is a former associate producer for Innovation Hub.]"

327,[UMass-Lowell Historian On Sexual Harassment In The Lowell Mills],"[BARBARA HOWARD: The “Me Too” movement is taking off, with women from many walks of life coming forward with their stories of sexual harassment in the workplace, but this is nothing new. It's been going on for centuries — literally. Young women left the farm to work in the mills of Lowell and Lawrence during the Industrial Revolution, overseen by factory bosses — mostly men. Pretty much all men. Robert Forrant is a history professor at UMass Lowell who studies labor and industry. Thanks for joining us, Professor Forrant., ROBERT FORRANT: My pleasure., BARBARA HOWARD: So how old were these girls?, ROBERT FORRANT: So most of the people that would have been the earliest workers coming into Lowell would have been anywhere from probably 14 to 15 to late teens, early 20s. That would have been the target that recruiters would have gone into the countryside to look for to bring to Lowell., BARBARA HOWARD: So they were very young. Just how prevalent was sexual harassment in the Lowell and Lawrence Mills?, ROBERT FORRANT: The Voice of Industry, which was a young women's and all-workers newspaper in the city, wrote all the time. And there's one quote I can read now, it says “It may be,"" wrote one woman, ""that most women are so dwarfed and weakened that they believe that dressing, cooking and loving make up the whole of life. You boast of the protection you afford to women. Protection from what? From the rude and disorderly of your own sex? Reform men, and women will no longer need the protection you make such a parade of giving."", BARBARA HOWARD:  So they don't out and out talk anatomically about what happened to them, but in broad strokes they paint a pretty clear picture, it sounds like. The mills offered housing for these girls to rent, where men were not allowed. Was that giving a false sense of security for the parents who allowed their daughters to leave the farm and go work in the mills?, ROBERT FORRANT:  False sense of security, yes, because on the job they could be, and they were, harassed by supervisors. Men would walk up behind them in the shop, rub up against them, do the kind of thing one could imagine. And women needed this work, and so there was always the threat of being fired. There was no union, no protections, and so if you didn't behave the way the boss wanted you to behave, that was a possibility. So lots of times, older women workers, workers who were maybe older in the sense of, like, 20, would take 14 and 15 year -olds under their wing and watch out for them and make sure that they weren't harassed, cornered in the stairwell or something like that., BARBARA HOWARD: Well what happened if the sexual harassment extended to a woman or young girl getting pregnant? What happened to them then?, ROBERT FORRANT: If she was pregnant she could be ostracized, removed from the boarding house that she was living in ... and go home. She could go home, but she might face the same ostracism in her own community in terms of being pregnant without being married. It took a while before people began to actually try to figure out ... who the aggressor was, who the culprit was, and what the power relationships were between young women in the mills and the mill overseers., BARBARA HOWARD: These young girls — their parents, I imagine, back on the farm, were depending on remittances sent back to the farm., ROBERT FORRANT: This was really part of the story, because most of the young women who come to the city of Lowell are sending money back to help pay for the farm. They may be paying so their brother can go to school, health problems at home, whatever it might be, and so the money is extremely important and that does put young women in the mills at risk. They don't want to lose their job, and so it puts them in a distinct compromised position., BARBARA HOWARD: Were there any mill owners who took a stand against this kind of behavior?, ROBERT FORRANT: There's no record that mill owners cared a heck of a lot about what happened day to day as long as they got the cloth out the back door of the factory and made their money., BARBARA HOWARD: What finally brought it to an end?, ROBERT FORRANT:  I don't think it ever was brought to an end. The way I see the history of women workers and women workers organizing, it’s across the 19th and 20th century. You can find, you know, similar complaints in textile factories, clothing factories on the Lower East Side of New York. Wherever you look, it's a constant oppression that young women have to deal with and only infrequently do labor institutions take up the cause and try to do something about the conditions. So it's left up to young women and it doesn't go away., BARBARA HOWARD:  And it's still going on today., ROBERT FORRANT: You can look at the global textile industry and find cases of young women in China, in textile mills or whatever, facing the same sorts of oppressions that young women would have faced in Lowell in 1840., You can read first-hand accounts of harassment in the workplace during the Industrial Revolution from The Voice of Industry here., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

Every 12 hours we’re now dealing with a piece of this story at a pace we haven’t seen.”, Kayyem was prompted to make her prediction by the buzz surrounding a story about how Hillary Clinton’s campaign funded what would eventually become the famous “Trump-Russia Dossier” that surfaced in January., A law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Convention hired the intelligence firm that eventually hired the dossier’s author, Chris Steele, to investigate Trump’s alleged ties to Russia and possible coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin., “Am I shocked, surprised, or [finding] it sleazy that the Democrats would have wanted to get potential incriminating information about financials or sex against Donald Trump?

Yes.”, , Kayyem speculated that the pace of stories critical of Hillary Clinton represents “a recognition by the White House team” that Mueller is getting close to something substantive as a result of his investigation., Kayyem pointed out that Mueller has interviewed former Press Secretary Sean Spicer and former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus., “This is so close to the Oval Office now, if not in the Oval Office, that all of this [dossier news] to me is just background noise to what Mueller is going to deliver,” she said. “This is more than an obstruction charge. There is something big underlying the obstruction.”, National security expert Juliette Kayyem is the host of the SCIF podcast, CEO of ZEMCAR and a contributor to CNN and WGBH.

333,[MCAS Scores Statewide Have Dropped After Release Of New Test],"[The first round of MCAS scores have come in since the state rolled out a new, redesigned test earlier this year — and they're not great., Statewide, students in grades 3-8 performed less well this year than they have in previous years. In a dramatic example, only 49 percent of students in eighth grade English met or exceeded expectations, compared to 79 percent of eighth grade students who achieved an equivalent designation on the old test in 2014., But Harvard Graduate School of Education professor and former state Secretary of Education Paul Reville says comparing the old and new exams is like comparing apples and oranges — and that lower scores, at least at first, shouldn't come as a surprise., ""It's a new yardstick,"" he said. ""We've set a higher standard."", Reville said the new test was designed to address the problem of students who had succeeded on the old MCAS finding themselves unprepared for college-level math and English, requiring remedial classes before they could move ahead. , ""It suggested the standards in the K-12 system were not high enough — even though our standards were admired around the nation,"" Reville explained. ""We're raising the standard for what we say is proficient and advanced work."", It's a similar position to one Gov. Charlie Baker has taken on the first round of new MCAS scores. He told Boston Public Radio last week, ""I think it's important for people to realize that it's a new test. You can't really benchmark it against the old one."", Click on the audio player above to listen to the entire interview with Paul Reville., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"
334,[Scientists Use Gene Editing Tool To Produce Low-Fat Pigs],"[Chinese scientists have used the gene editing tool CRISPR to create genetically modified pigs that have less body fat. In other words, low-fat bacon., The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, shows that scientists inserted a gene into the pigs that would allow them to use their fat to warm their bodies in colder temperatures. This results in a pig that has 24 percent less body fat than an average pig. Since these pigs don’t get as cold as normal pigs, farmers could save money on energy costs. They could also potentially change the food industry by providing low-fat bacon., “I am all for this technology,” said Art Caplan, director of the division of medical ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center, during an interview with Boston Public Radio Wednesday. “It is going to get us a better diet.”, While the FDA has yet to approve the sale of the genetically modified meat, Caplan does not see any reason for them deny what for some bacon lovers could be the invention of the century., “The FDA will want to see safety studies done to make sure that if you eat the bacon you don’t turn into a goblin or something. I think it will be approved,” said Caplan.  , Caplan says that this could be the beginning of a future where our food is not only genetically modified, but genetically engineered., ""Maybe you could engineer other foods so they have more nutrition, or good foods that we would all be able to eat like asparagus that tastes better."", Click the audio player above to hear the full interview with the Director of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center Art Caplan., Jason Turesky is an Associate Producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

336,"[In Somerville Elections, Bernie Veterans Seek To Outflank 'Mayor Joe' Curtatone]","[Something’s brewing in Somerville – and it’s not a gastropub., For the first time in a decade, 14-year incumbent Somerville mayor Joe Curtatone faces a challenger, Teamsters driver Payton Corbett, in the city’s November municipal elections., Meanwhile, more than half of the city’s wards contested, including, for the first time in recent memory, energetic races against three incumbent members of the city’s Board of Alderman, Somerville’s equivalent of a city council., In a city that might seem unified in its progressive bent, cracks are starting to show., Adding to the complexity of it all: a direct line between this year’s contested races and the Bernie Sanders movement which, in Somerville anyway, won the day in last year’s Democratic primary. Sanders was in town, Monday to support the Somerville candidates, as well as those running in other municipalities., The key issues are easy to spot: development, displacement, and affordability.  , And the tumult playing out in Somerville this year is just one manifestation of political unrest across Greater Boston over issues that tend to overlap., Boston City Councilor Tito Jackson, challenging Marty Walsh for the mayor's seat, has made residential displacement the core of his campaign.  , In Cambridge, City Council candidates have faced increasing criticism for accepting donations from private developers (as in Somerville, some candidates have vowed not to accept such contributions). , The campaign of Somerville mayoral would-be Corbett is, to be sure, a long shot., “Mayor Joe” Curtatone is popular and has had ample opportunity, especially since Trump’s election, to demonstrate his progressive bona fides in a city that, by and large, prides itself on its liberal values., But the challenge to Curtatone’s leadership is bigger than Corbett’s run for mayor, and the contested races for the city’s Board of Aldermen are proof.  , Among those races are the insurgent campaigns of local fitness gym owner and neighborhood activist J.T. Scott and biologist and former Bernie Sanders activist Ben Ewen-Campen for the city’s 2nd and 3rd wards respectively, both in and around Union Square., Both Scott and Ewen-Campen have focused their campaigns not so much against their incumbent opponents as on how Curtatone has managed development in the city, especially in a few high-profile cases., Among the most prominent: a recent deal involving Federal Realty Trust Investments (known locally as “FRIT”), the developer behind the transformation of Somerville’s Assembly Row.  , Earlier this year, FRIT petitioned for an exemption from a new requirement, passed unanimously by the city’s Board of Alderman, that 20% of units in big new developments be “affordable.”, Protests erupted, from residents as well as many city Aldermen, who argued the developer shouldn’t get a break; but the power to grant or deny the waiver lay with city’s Planning Board, appointed by the mayor., Eventually Curtatone struck a controversial deal allowing for just 6% affordable housing on-site but also a $10 million donation to a city affordable housing program., Ewen-Campen, running for Ward 3 encompassing Union Square and Prospect Hill, says attending public meetings to protest the exemption drove him to run for office., “At one of those meetings, it clicked,” he recalls. “This was going to be about three dozen units.” -- not required to be ‘affordable’ on site – “It really made the issue concrete. “, “I think we need a board that’s willing to stand up to make sure that these appointees represent the will of the people,” he says., J.T. Scott, running an insurgent campaign for Ward 2, which encompasses Union and Inman Squares,: agrees: The FRIT deal “was negotiated behind closed doors,” he told WGBH News. “I think that’s emblematic of the most problematic issues we have around both transparency and accountability.”, But muddling these critiques is this: These candidates aren’t running against Curtatone; they’re running against incumbent Aldermen who, in many cases, agree., For example: Alderman Maryanne Heuston, the fifteen-year incumbent Scott is trying to unseat, and who says she did, in fact, buck the mayor on this very issue., “I was publicly non-supportive – I testified before the Planning Board and said, ‘You cannot let them get away with his,’” she recounts. “There’s a reason people want to develop here. We’ve got something they want desperately. ”, Heuston, a senior director for the Cambridge Health Alliance, has been an Alderman for fifteen years  and, like her challenger, has avoided a negative campaign. But if challengers like Scott are running on a message of “change,” Heuston emphasizes another quality: experience., Facing a slightly different kind of challenge is Ward 1 Alderman Matt McLaughlin, whose opponent, Elio LoRusso, a local manufacturer who, unlike other insurgent candidates, is noticeably supportive of Curtatone and, also unlike other insurgents, is supported by at least some of Curtatone’s political allies., LoRusso, like his opponent, talks about the affordability issue but in a recent interview with WGBH News had praise for the mayor:, “Since he’s been mayor, the city’s grown,” LoRusso said. “It’s clean and it’s a city that everyone wants to come to.”, McLaughlin, another former Bernie Sanders activist, has probably been the most consistently critical voice of Curtatone among the city’s Alderman., He too is highly critical of the FRIT deal: “This is indicative of a city where they do anything the mayor wants,” he said., McLaughlin believes that the mayor is behind the challenge to his seat., While there are no formal “tickets” among the candidates running for office, the group Our Revolution Somerville, which grew out of the local effort to support Bernie Sanders’ primary bid, has endorsed a slate of candidates -- including: Scott, Ewen-Campen, and incumbent t McLaughlin – who happen to be critical of Curtatone’s leadership., (The group has also endorsed newcomer Will Mbah for one of the city’s At-Large seats; and Jesse Clingan, who is running against Omar Boukili for an open seat in the city’s 4th Ward)., Mayoral candidate Corbett was also endorsed by the group, but the endorsement was withdrawn after a report by the Boston Globe describing Corbett using insensitive language in social media posts to describe women, Asians or Asian-Americans and African-Americans., Payton says he is sorry but also that the posts were from years ago and taken out of context., There’s little question that the Bernie crowd has added energy to the races by its endorsements and those endorsements have pushed to the front the issue of money from for-profit developers in local races., Insurgents Corbett, Scott, Ewen-Campen, Clingan, Mbah -- as well as incumbent McLaughlin -- have all pledged not to take contributions from developers. Their opponents have not., Many Somerville politicos argue that the issue is overblown, if not irrelevant. But not all agree., “To me, it’s a no brainer – I just don’t think any elected official should be taking money from these folks,” says Somerville Alderman Mark Niedergang, who is running uncontested to continue representing the city’s Spring Hill and Winter Hill neighborhoods.   , Neidergang has put his support behind incumbent McLaughlin and Clingan, but also supports Curtatone for mayor – though he is critical of the mayor’s taking donations from developers too.  , “They come before the city with development proposals that are intended to make money for themselves,” he says. “If elected officials are taking money from them, it certainly, you know, looks to a reasonable person like they could be influenced.”, An earlier version of this story misstated two names in the piece and has since been updated., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
337,[The Legal Implications Of The Lowell Pit Bull Case],"[A seven-year old boy died Saturday after an attack by two pit bulls in Lowell. Although the investigation is ongoing, authorities say the boy entered a fenced-in area where the pit bulls were located, and he was killed before the police arrived. One of the dogs was euthanized, and the other remains with animal control. , Joe Mathieu spoke with Northeastern Law Professor and WGBH Legal Analyst Daniel Medwed about the case. , Joe Mathieu: I realize criminal charges have not been filed yet, but back in 2011, a city ordinance in Lowell regulating pit bulls was overturned by state legislation. Is it possible the owners could be charged with homicide?, Daniel Medwed: In theory, yes, over the years there have been a number of dog mauling cases across the country that resulted in homicide charges. The issue in these cases often boils down to two things: First, what was the owner’s mental state? Did he or she know about the dog’s dangerous propensities or, at a minimum, should the owner have been aware of these proclivities? Second, given this awareness, did the owner take sufficient precautions to protect neighbors and others from injury? So, depending on the circumstances here, there could be a homicide case, quite possibly manslaughter, based on the idea that the owner may have consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk by keeping the pit bulls in this location without adequate safeguards., JM: How do we determine whether an owner took sufficient precautions? What factors do we look for?, DM: It’s a very fact-specific inquiry. Here, I think the details surrounding the fence might prove to be very important in the prosecutors’ charging decision about manslaughter. How high was it, how secure was it, were the animals further restrained within the yard? There is a famous case from California, People v. Michael Berry, where the owner had kept a dangerous pit bull chained in his yard in a neighborhood with young children and that wasn’t considered enough., JM: How important is the fact that this incident occurred on private property rather than a public space? In other words, could trespassing play a role, especially given the age of the child?, DM: Yes, especially if the victim’s family were to try to sue in civil court for money damages. Massachusetts has very specific rules governing so-called “dog bite” cases. The owner of a dog is liable for personal injury caused by the animal unless the injured person was trespassing or provoked the animal. The age of seven is legally insignificant – children under the age of seven are presumed not to be capable of committing trespass, which makes sense, they likely don’t understand the significance of property lines.  But here the boy was seven, not under seven, so — seemingly — the trespass might prove a barrier to any financial recovery., JM: Leaving aside the issue of trespass, does it matter whether the owner knew about the dog’s violent tendencies?  If the owner had no idea about the potential violence, does that relieve that person of liability?, DM: Let’s look at the civil and criminal cases separately. As for the civil case, Massachusetts is what’s known as a “strict liability” state on this issue. It doesn’t matter whether the owner had prior knowledge — when it comes to civil liability, you might be on the hook even without any fault on the part of the owner, even for a first bite. So, the owner’s knowledge doesn’t matter. But it does matter regarding the criminal case — whether the owner knew, or should have known of the risk, is crucial in determining whether there was culpability., JM: What a tragedy.  I’m sure we will be consulting you again as the investigation unfolds. Thank you., This transcript has been edited for clarity., WGBH News' Legal Analyst Daniel Medwed is a professor of Law and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. ]"

Today, movements like Black Lives Matter echo the sentiments of these civil rights activists, but have yet to produce such prominent figureheads. In a recent New York Times article, Barbara Ransby, an associate professor of history and African-American studies at University of Illinois at Chicago, argues that the lack of a central figure allows Black Lives Matter to become a powerful, decentralized democratic movement. , Reverends Irene Monroe and Emmett Price joined Boston Public Radio Monday to discuss Ransby's commentary during All Revved Up. Price and Monroe both agreed with Ransby that the democratic structure of Black Lives Matter makes the movement strong from the lowest grassroots level to the top., “It is called intersectional activism,"" said Monroe. “It gets away from this cult of personality, this charismatic leader. What it also does, is it empowers people like us not to look for one person to get up and make a change, but invites every one of us to make a change.”, , Price says that having a few figureheads like those who came to the forefront during the Civil Rights Movement can also potentially be dangerous for the leaders, like it was during the 60s., ""In this type of politicking and this type of situation, that is essentially putting a new head on the bulls eye in order to get shot and killed and assassinated,” Price said., Price added that movements like the Civil Rights Movement and Black Lives Matter are about more than just an individual., “It is not so much about liking someone, it is about believing in something,” said Price. “The notion here is that people on the ground are better prepared to explore, express and enact democracy.”, Click on the audio player above to listen to the full interview with Reverends Irene Monroe and Emmett Price., Jason Turesky is an Associate Producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

She said, ""Now we know we have a project that we can build from the resources we have available, and while there's lots more work to be done, I think that today really marks the day when we can be sure there's going to be a Green Line Extension."", The design-build contract will be the largest contract for the project, which was nearly derailed by cost-overruns two years ago and underwent a switch in the company hired to oversee construction earlier this year., John Dalton, program manager for the Green Line Extension, told reporters he was ""relieved"" when he learned Monday that two of the three firms competing for the contract certified they could do it within the budget. He did not specify which of the three construction firms was unable to certify that it met the T's cost requirements., ""We're going to hold off on being specific about that while we're still in the procurement process,"" Dalton told reporters after briefing the MBTA Fiscal and Management Control Board., , In February the T identified three groups qualified to handle the construction: GLX Constructors, Green Line Partners, and Walsh Barletta Granite, JV., The actual prices and other aspects of the bids will be unveiled at a ""public pricing opening"" scheduled for Nov. 17, MBTA General Manager Luis Ramírez told the control board., ""We still have some very big steps in front of us,"" Dalton told the board., The T control board and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation Board – responsible for funding the project – considered cashiering the trolley extension after transportation officials in 2015 disclosed that it might run as much as $1 billion over-budget. The T scrapped plans for the group White Skanska Kiewit to build the project, pared down plans for station amenities, and ultimately elected to proceed with a somewhat modified extension project., ""This is a project that could have easily been canceled,"" Control Board Chairman Joseph Aiello said Monday. He credited Gov. Charlie Baker with encouraging T officials to stick with it, quoting the governor as saying, ""Get at it. Try to get it right."", The extension will allow trolley passengers to travel outbound from a new Lechmere Station in East Cambridge to six new stops in Somerville and Medford., Last spring, the T chose CH2M Hill to be project and construction manager for $57 million but the agency later had to drop the company after it was acquired by one of the firms in the bidding for the actual construction, creating a conflict of interest. The T has worked out an arrangement with HAKS Engineering to take on the management role, according to T spokesman Joe Pesaturo., Dalton said it is unlikely that sort of scenario would repeat itself., ""I have no reasons to think that will happen, or might happen. I think it very unlikely, but I can't completely tell you 100 percent that will not happen. That's completely speculative,"" Dalton told reporters., Asked what would have happened if all three bidders were unable to certify they could meet the T's cost threshold, Dalton said officials would have then needed to ""consider plan B.""]"

346,[Framingham Voters Will Elect First Mayor ],"[Framingham voters are about to choose their first mayor, taking the next step in the transformation of the state's largest town into its newest city., In April, the suburb of nearly 70,000 decided by a narrow margin to change its form of government, from a town manager and board of selectmen to a mayor and city council. Seven candidates ran for mayor in the September preliminary election. Two finalists were selected for the Nov. 7 general election., Yvonne Spicer is a museum executive and town meeting member who finished first in the preliminary, receiving almost twice as many votes as runner-up John Stefanini. He is a lifelong resident and lawyer who has previously held elected office as a state representative and selectman., Schools, business growth and better representation have emerged as the major issues in the campaign. Spicer and Stefanini have taken somewhat similar positions on those issues, although they emphasize different things., Voters want to know what the candidates will do about the four of Framingham’s 14 public schools that are under-performing, based on state ratings., Stefanini offered this prescription: “We need to make sure were doing early pre-k. Second, we need to look at partnering with our corporations and working with them to bring mentoring and internships and contributions for more universal after-school enrichment programs.”, Spicer said she will work with school leaders to address educational shortcomings at the four schools., “One of the beauties of the MCAS and a lot of the performance indicators is we can look at where we’re failing. We can look at exact content. We can also look at the structure of the schools,” she said, referring to state-mandated testing by its acronym.., Business development is another major issue. Many voters believe a city form of government will promote commercial growth, by speeding up needed approvals, and ultimately easing the burden on residential taxpayers., Paul Joseph,  president of the Metro West Chamber of Commerce, said the new mayor and city council have to figure out how to help businesses across the board., “Framingham has some of the country’s biggest employers here, in that you have Bose, Staples, Poland Springs, Nestle, among some,"" he said. ""Then you have many family-owned first-generation businesses in the downtown area, in different pockets.”, Joseph supported the new city form of government, and hopes it will be a boon for businesses, by “setting the tax rate, understanding what incentives will be debated to put into place, (in order) to retain those large employers.”, Spicer, who once sold real estate, promised her administration would make things easier for businesses in “the process of permitting, the process of signage and a lot of the conversation about how do you start a business.”, Stefanini, whose law firm focuses on real estate, said as mayor he would build up small businesses downtown., “We’ve been taking their parking spaces away from them in front of their businesses and telling them they have to replace signs they’ve had for decades,"" he said. ""We’re making it very difficult for them in the permitting process.”, Under the new system, communities throughout the city will have representation. The mayor will work with councilors from the nine districts and another two elected at large., Iilma Paixao, general manager of Framingham’s Brazilian radio station, predicted the councilor system will give immigrant communities a voice in city government., “You need someone to go to, and not having that makes it very difficult for people to get engaged,” Paixao said., Most importantly, the mayor will be the one voice who speaks for all residents, the entire city., “I would be working collaboratively with them in ensuring that everyone in this community feels welcomed, feels safe and also feels that there’s an opportunity for them to live and work and be productive in Framingham,” Spicer said., Stefanini also promised to govern inclusively. “We need to make sure that our community is servicing all of our residents,” he said., If Spicer wins, she would become the second African-American popularly elected mayor in Massachusetts. Setti Warren, the outgoing mayor Newton, became the first in 2010., The town clerk, Valerie Mulvey, said she expects a historic turnout of more than 50 percent. That would be about double the turnout in September. Stefanini is counting on voters who sat out preliminary to overcome the big lead Spicer had in September., Braintree was last municipality in the Massachusetts to make the transition from town to city, in 2008.

Among those who will be racing out of the Charles River are Mary Mazzio and Annabel Eyres. They are no strangers to rowing or to each other. They competed against each other twenty five years ago in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Annabel Eyres rode for her native Great Britain and Mary Mazzio, who is a native of Needham, Massachusetts, for the United States. But this weekend they're going to be rowing together on the same team. Mary Mazzio and Annabel Ayers are with me now in studio. Thanks for coming in., Mazzio: Thanks for having us Barbara. Great to be here., Howard: So you must be training together. What are you going to be rowing?, Mazzio: We are rowing a women's quad together so there will be four members from the 1992 team, really doing a nostalgic lap — three from Team USA and Annabel is our friends from across the pond., Howard: Did you go head to head back in ‘92? Were you on competing boats on the same race?, Mazzio: Yeah, I think Annabel was one lane over, if I remember, and got the better of us., Howard: So what was it like to row as a young woman back in the day?, Ayers: It was really tough because I'd learned [at] Oxford. And in those days you had the Oxford, Cambridge men's boat race which got huge amounts of coverage. They did get sponsorship, but we had no money whatsoever and we were always going to scratch around, write endless letters to get sponsorship., Howard: Have there been gains made?, Ayers: Huge, huge gains. So back in 1987 and '88, there was a group of us who were kind of campaigning to try and get the women's race on the same stretch of river as the men and we felt that we were being cheated. So we did try to get things moving by having dialogue with the organizers of the men's race to say 'Look, we've been rowing for several decades now. We're perfectly capable of doing exactly the same course. We want to do the same race as the men.' And we just had a complete blanket no response. They came up with ridiculous excuses like the tide wouldn't allow for an extra race. And two years ago, they actually introduced a women's boat race on the same stretch of river from Putney to Mortlake., Howard: So that was the argument we were making, how many years ago? They just started years ago …, Ayers: 30 years ago., Howard: So just in the past two or three years it was resolved?, Ayers: Yes, it was finally resolved., Mazzio: I will say one of the Head of the Charles sponsors — BNY Melon — was so helpful when it came to the boat race in the UK, because they said if we're going to sponsor this, you need to have a women's race. And kudos to them because they helped to pave the way, which is so unusual for a brand to stand out like that., Howard: So what is it like in the United States for you as a woman back then versus now?, Mazzio: I think Title IX, which requires equal opportunity for women — those battles have played out in the United States actually on the rowing course. Athletic administrators across the country, in order to build up parity and build up numbers to compensate, let's say for a men's football team, will launch a rowing team. So you see teams now — University of Texas, University of Ohio, at schools across the nation at places that never had rowing. And the net-net is that Team USA women's eight, our Olympic women, are our prize jewel. Why? Because all of a sudden they're getting scholarships to all of these places and the sport is attracting the best athletes. And so these women are getting gold medal, after gold medal, after gold medal, at the Olympic Games. But back in the day it wasn't like that., Howard: Title IX comes out of rowing, right?, Mazzio: Well Title IX interestingly enough was signed into law by President Nixon as part of the 1972 Education Act. But rules were promulgated in 1974, ‘75 that basically said you have to have equal opportunity for men and women in federally funded institutions., And it was a rower, Chris Ernst at Yale University, that brought this to a head. And at that time it was 1976. Yale had not become accustomed to women yet at this point. And there were no facilities for the women to train in and to shower in., Yale had gone co-ed and the boat house was 20 minutes away. So the women would row in the rain, in the snow, and get on an unheated bus shivering, while every last man would shower at the boathouse and then they'd go back to campus. On top of that, all of the women at Yale were winning their races. The men were losing theirs. So it was just an egregious situation and the captain — her name is Chris Ernst — she became a two time Olympian. So she was on an Olympic track and couldn't shower at the boathouse. So they tried diplomatic channels, and they were told the wheels of change grind slowly here at Yale University. And her attitude was, we pay the same amount of tuition as the boys, what's wrong with this picture? And they ended up demonstrating. They stormed the athletic director's office, stripped, had Title IX in blue marker on their chests, on their back, fully buck naked. Yale women stripping? This thing went around the globe in 1976 and people were sending in checks, you know, build those women a shower and get clothes on those women! And every athletic director across the country saw this covered in The New York Times with women stripping and they all stood up and said OK how do we avoid that situation?, Right? OK, we need to have equal facilities for men and women., Howard: How did that affect you? What was it like for you when you were a young rower?, Mazzio: My first year on the U.S. team we literally were housed in Indianapolis in tents while the men were put up at hotel rooms. Now could I have spoken up at that point in my life? Should I have spoken up? Absolutely. But I was focused on making the team, getting in the boat, trying not to faint in the Indianapolis heat. You know, you fast forward 25 years and you look back and you say, well that was egregious — why didn't I speak out? And I think having that Olympic experience, that confronting your fear, I do speak out and have the courage and wisdom now to speak out at a time where I wish I had been more like Chris Ernst and the women at Yale who did speak out because they paved the path for me, for other women that came behind them., Howard: So here you go. You're going to be on the water this weekend, what day?, Mazzio: So we're racing together, all four of us, on Sunday at 9:30., Howard: And the weather looks like it's going to cooperate —  a lot of sun and highs in the low 70s. That's good or bad for you?, Ayers: Good., Howard: Well good luck., Mazzio: Thank you Barbara. Thanks for having us., Ayers: Thank you., Howard: That's Mary Mazzio and Annabel Eyres. Twenty five years ago, they were on competing teams rowing in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Mary for the United States, Annabel for Great Britain. And this weekend, they are going to be team mates rowing together at the Head of the Charles Regatta., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

350,"[In Halifax, Mobile Home Residents Set Record By Buying The Land Beneath Their Homes]","[Four hundred and thirty mobile home owners in Halifax, Massachusetts, have made history., For $27 million, these residents bought the land beneath their homes. It is the largest purchase of its kind ever in the country., “I almost didn't think I'd live long enough to see it,” says Myrna Yunits, who has lived at the Halifax Mobile Home Estates – about an hour south of Boston – since 1980., As Yunits and her community have freed themselves of an outside landlord, they’ve ushered in a new sense of security — and also a lot of work., At the community center, the residents are eating a cake in celebration. The frosting reads: “We Own It!” Out the window are streets and streets of manufactured homes, pastel vinyl between tall pines, all of which residents here now own., Before today, they were like most mobile home parks; they had the worst of both worlds: buy the home and rent the land., A mobile home can cost tens of thousands, if not a few hundred thousand, dollars. But, residents still pay hundreds in rent each month., Despite being called ""mobile homes,"" these houses are very hard and expensive to move. Increases in land values go mostly to the landlord, not the homeowner. Plus, the residents are at the whim of whoever owns the land., “When you had a complaint. It was so sad, too bad,” says Barbara Davis., , Davis lives at Colonial Estates, a 55 and older manufactured home community in Taunton. Soon after Davis moved here, a big corporation bought the park and, she says, the company wasn't taking proper care of the property., A year ago, when the land went up for sale for $11 million, residents tried to buy it as a cooperative. Massachusetts is one of just five states that, by law, ensures residents have first dibs to team up to buy the land., “I fought it, like crazy,” Davis says. She admits she didn’t think the residents should collectively purchase the property., “Honestly, I didn’t think that we had the capabilities within the park to be able to run it,” she says., However, a majority of the residents voted in favor of the purchase., Now, Davis is a cheerleader for the other side., “How wrong I was. This is the best thing that ever could have happened,” she says., Colonial Estates homeowners formed a low equity co-op, where residents bought in at $1,000. The rest of the purchase was financed by a loan to their association and didn’t require personal liability., This model started in the 1980s in New Hampshire but has taken off, especially in New England. Since 2009, seven percent of Massachusetts’ manufactured home communities have become resident-owned. , They function like a mini-democracy. One house, one vote. Collective responsibility., Davis says everyone does what they can. She mows the lawn. “This week, I mowed Wednesday for four hours and, yesterday, I mowed for three hours,” she says., Davis swears there’s a totally new sense of community since the purchase: residents volunteered to buy new benches, and neighbors are getting to know one another. There's a bocce team, bingo on Mondays, cards a few nights a week, and a bonfire every Friday — to name just a few of the community events., However, democracy can be messy., “You have 147 households now. So, you have 147 different personalities,” says Michael Scarlett, who is on the board at Colonial Estates., He says despite seeing a lot of benefits from the purchase, rents did go up from $500 to $580 per month. He says that’s hard on many residents, especially seniors on a fixed income., And, he says, many communities struggle with setting expectations correctly., “When you buy the community, the first thing people feel is: We own the community now, things will get done. They don’t realize that it doesn’t work that way,” says Scarlett., Colonial Estates needs to update their power lines, redo some roads, repair the communal tool sheds. Scarlett has had to explain to everyone: “It's going to have to be figured into the budget, which is going to definitely increase the rent, because we're just by the skin of our teeth now.”, Scarlett says it helps that there's no profit motive. And it also helps they're not alone. There’s a management community that helps with day-to-day operations. And there’s Resident Owned Communities USA., ROC USA is a nation-wide nonprofit that helps manufactured home communities figure out their financing and set up their governance structure., “In the beginning, it was really messy. I actually I had no idea what a board of directors even was,” says Jeanee Wright., Wright lives in a resident-owned community and, for the past five years, she's worked with an affiliate of the ROC USA network – called Cooperative Development Institute - teaching other manufactured home communities. All the resident-owned communities get one-on-one coaching for a decade and free leadership trainings forever., “The sense of empowerment of people goes far beyond basic daily problems,” says Wright., Having grown up in a manufactured home park, Wright says the communities are often stigmatized. She was called a ‘Tin Can Kid’ in school. And she knows her family worried about rent increase. , “I remember my parents not feeling very secure,” says Wright. She adds that when a community becomes resident-owned, “people who have never had the opportunity to have a say in almost anything they did in life, have that opportunity. It's a hugely empowering process.”, ROC USA has helped more than 200 communities nationwide become co-ops. “And not one co-op that we’ve assisted with their purchase and afterward has ever failed – has ever resold their property, ever closed down, ever gone bankrupt or filed for bankruptcy or lost it due to a foreclosure. Not one,” says Paul Bradley, president of ROC USA., The community in Halifax is ROC USA's biggest test yet., ""It's kind of scary. We're taking on a lot,” admits Myrna Yunits. “But we can do it."", Yunits says for the 430 families at Halifax Mobile Home Estates, having a sense of security and control of their own fate is worth the work and the rent increase., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

353,"[72 Years Later, Remains Of MIA Veteran Make It Back Home To Brookline]","[The families of Missing in Action servicemen experience a complicated kind of grief, but Samuel H. Bahn expressed what his family has been through in two devastating lines. , “In the Jewish tradition, it’s customary for burial to take place no more than 72 hours after death. For our dear Dickie Horwitz, it’s taken 72 years,"" he said., , Finally, Bahn said, at Levine Chapels, his cousin would have “a dignified funeral to mourn his passing and to honor the true Brookline patriot who did his duty bravely, paying the ultimate price for his country.”, “Dickie” was 2nd Lt. Richard M. Horwitz, who served as a navigator aboard a B-24 aircraft that was lost in 1945. “They were bombing a railroad bridge, and when they finished bombing it, they were hit by flak,” according to one of his surviving cousins, Joyce Bahn Schwartz. She’s absorbed the report on Horwitz compiled by the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) so well, she can recite the details., “His plane was bombing a bridge in the Brenner Pass, trying to prevent supplies going back and forth,"" she said. ""This is about two and a half months before the war is over, totally over, in Europe."", Schwartz says the American troops were trying to prevent Nazi troops from resupplying in northern Italy, and were trying to isolate them.They were bombing the railroad bridge so the Nazi troops couldn't get back into Germany to defend it. That's when the plane was hit. , ""[The flak] hit the No. 3 engine and the No. 4 engine. The No. 3 engine controls the hydraulics of the entire plane … [so] there was no way to steer this thing,"" Schwartz said. “My aunt and uncle were told the plane went down in the Austrian Alps, and for years and years, they believed that."", But the plane actually crashed in the northern Adriatic Sea. In 2013, some local divers found the wreck off the coast of Grado, Italy, and photographed it. , “They were able to get the number off the rudder. They sent that along to the U.S. government. The U.S. government said, ‘Ah ha! That's this plane. We know this plane.’ And they also saw osseous remains. In other words, bony remains,"" Schwartz said., Forensic scientists at the DPAA went through a painstaking process to identify the remains, ultimately matching DNA to a surviving family member, Jonathan McHugh, the son of another of Dickie’s cousins. At the funeral on Sunday, McHugh read a poem expressing his joy at being the genetic connection to his long-lost relative, and gratitude to “Dickie” for pulling the family together., Schwartz says that the entire family never gave up hope of Horwitz’s return. “Growing up we just missed him. It was like, ‘He’s supposed to be there — where is he?’ It usually came up at the holidays, either Thanksgiving or Passover or something like that, when we would all be together as a family. His presence was missed.” , , She regrets that some of the family members who kept the faith and worked to find Horwitz didn’t survive to see this., “I tear up periodically, but it's not because I'm sad about my cousin. It's sad that his parents and his brothers aren't here. That's the reason,"" Schwartz said. ""I mean, other than that, this, to us, is not a sad occasion because we've got him back.”, Schwartz says that before she died, Horwitz’s mother gave her and the other cousins a mission., “We were to keep looking and not be satisfied until we got him home. Even though it's possible that it would never happen,” she said, her voice breaking. “It was like a missing piece. When we went to pick him up at the airport, it was nice to get him back, but when we got him to Levine's in Brookline, we said, 'You’re home, Dickie! It's Brookline!  You're home!'"", After the service at Levine Chapels, Horwitz was accompanied by an honor guard to West Roxbury, where he was laid to rest in a family plot., Arun Rath is the host of WGBH News' All Things Considered. ]"

366,[‘Romeo and Juliet’ Provision Challenges Mass. Sexual Consent Law],"[
	The push for criminal justice reform on Beacon Hill has hit a road bump. Tucked within the bill is a small, yet controversial proposal that would change how the state prosecutes sex-related crimes between teenagers.
	 
	Right now, a person under 16 cannot consent to sex — period. In essence, if a 17-year-old has sex with his 15-year-old girlfriend, he’s committed a crime and could have to register as a sex offender for life. The new provision, informally known as the “Romeo and Juliet” provision would change that.

371,[K9 Officers Carry Narcan To Protect Dogs],"[First responders and police departments across Massachusetts carry naloxone — also known as Narcan — to reverse the effects of opioid overdoses in people. Now, some K9 units are carrying Narcan to protect four-legged officers who may encounter dangerous drugs., In Quincy, K9 police officer Scott Doherty and his partner Mace go through a practice explosives search. Mace, a Belgian Malinois, points his ears at attention as he sniffs intently., “Mace will be five in October, and I’ve had him for four years,” said Doherty., Doherty says they work the Boston marathon and the 4th of July celebration on the Esplanade every year,, “We do everything from large venues and events for explosives detection sweeps. As part of that, he also detects guns,” said Doherty., Mace, like the department's other K9s, uses his nose to find suspects, missing people and guns. He may also encounter opioids, like heroin or carfentanil, and Doherty says all of this can be lethal,, “With drugs typically comes guns, so Mace may very well be involved in a search warrant or any kind of search for a gun as a result of a fellow drug investigation or drug search,” he said., To protect his partner, Doherty carries Narcan. And Narcan is expensive — the auto injector, which is a needle, costs about $500, and the nasal inhaler costs $40. Quincy officers carry both, and Lt. Bob Gillan, who runs the K9 unit, says the cost is worth it,, “We follow the trends in the country,"" he said. ""There have been a lot of canines exposed to fentanyl and carfentanil, so we just want to stay up on the protection of the dogs.”, A year ago, Gillan brought in staff from New England Animal Medical Center to train his staff on giving Narcan to the department's dogs., Jessica Dasent, a veterinarian, says, just as with humans, it’s important to know the signs., “When an animal is exposed to an opioid, some signs you’re going to notice would be not responding to commands, staring off into space,"" she said, adding that even if a handler is not sure, it’s better to act, “Narcan is relatively harmless; it doesn’t have many adverse effects, so if they get an unnecessary Narcan injection, they’re not going to respond to it in a bad way.”, In Quincy, first responders have used Narcan more than 700 times on humans, and officers haven’t had to use it on K9s,  , But Doherty says he’s ready to protect his partner., “If Mace were to come in contact with an opioid, fentanyl, heroin carfentanil, he would need my help, and I would need to recognize the signs in him,” he said., This post has been updated to correct the spelling of Jessica Dasent's name., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"

378,[Native American Rap Group Takes On Opioid Dealers],"[The opioid epidemic has touched virtually every community by now. And one population that has been hard hit is Native American tribes. A group of Mashpee Wampanoag tribal members are fed up with funerals in their tribe and are speaking out on the issue — through music., 23-year-old Keon Jackson closes his eyes as he sings an honor song from his tribe. Jackson is a traditional Native American singer. He’s also a rapper, who goes by the name Young Sumo.   , “You’re killing my people, 'cause you sell narcotics,"" he raps along with a drummer. ""You're doing it and still broke, so basically no profit. Do you think our ancestors want to watch this? It's utter disrespect, and straight up nonsense."", , This is the new song “Flippin,” by a group of Wampanoag tribal members called the Soul Poet’s Syndicate. And as you might have noticed — it’s a defiantly anti-drug song., You can hear the full studio version here:, , Jackson sits in the front pew of the tribe’s meeting house. In this room, he’s been a traditional drummer at a lot of funerals for people who died from opioid overdoses., “Maybe, like, a dozen,"" he said, trying to guess the number of funerals. ""I don’t know. A lot.”, That’s because the Wampanoag are being devastated by opioids. “I'm fed up with it,"" Jackson said. ""I'm pretty sure a lot of people in our community is fed up with the deaths and funerals. It’s just unnatural, you know, for people – there’s parents losing their children. You know, that's unnatural.”   , The idea for the song came from music producer, University of Massachusetts professor and tribal member Morgan James Peters.  , “I was sitting right here,"" Peters said, as he looked around the tribal meeting house. ""And I'm looking at this young man's parents on the front row. And I'm looking at his children, and I'm looking at his wife. You know, the backs of their heads, and I'm looking at his family, and I'm looking at somebody who, I was there when he learned to ride a bicycle, and we're saying goodbye to him.”, , He wanted to do something. And he decided to do what he knows best. Peters is a musician and a producer. And as a Wampanoag, he said it’s part of their tradition to share songs., “We wanted to come up with a song that we could share with the rest of Indian country, [and that] we can share with everybody,” he said., Peters reached out to some of the young rappers he knew in the tribe, including his 14-year-old son Morgan, who goes by the rap name Zyg, or the Z-Y-G. Zyg said when his dad first talked to him about the project, he wasn’t so sure. But he took it on because he trusted his dad would do it right., “You see all these raps out there that are trying ... the purpose is to try to reach kids,"" he said. ""But the thing that they're missing is it's just, like, they're being corny about it.”, , “The opioid crisis has been devastating to my people,"" said Mashpee Wampanoag Chairman Cedric Cromwell. ""Nineteen deaths within 21 months. And that's staggering.”, When asked why the tribe has been hit so hard by opioids, his response was immediate. “Historical trauma,"" he said. ""Historical trauma that has happened to Native American people for many years.”, Cromwell said the impact of colonialism is still felt. “And then oppression kicks in, depression kicks in, all these social impacts kick in. And then people look for vices. They look for vices, and what is the next hot thing out there that's going to make you feel better.”, The percentage of people identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native who report misusing opioids is similar to the general population, according to federal statistics. But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says in 2015, one in 100 deaths of native people were from opioid overdoses, compared to one in 125 for the rest of the population., Cromwell said he’d like more support from state government – including being involved in the Baker Administration’s opioid addiction working group. “Governor Baker has declared, you know, the opioid crisis,"" Cromwell said. ""It doesn't help our people, because we're forgotten.”, In a statement, a Department of Public Health spokesperson pointed to a number of substance abuse initiatives the state and Tribe are involved in together., The federal government recently awarded the tribe a $170,000 grant to support intervention services like the overdose-reversal drug Narcan and training for peer recovery coaches., The lyrics of the Soul Poet’s Syndicate song are aimed not at opioid users, but at those who are selling the drugs to the tribe. And the young musicians say they hope they can reach that targeted audience, and maybe make them think twice., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

She is told that her 19-year-old son, Joel James Turner, has been killed — stabbed to death. What to do with that kind of pain is the subject of a film, “Circle Up."" This weekend it's part of the GlobeDocs Film Festival., Sitting through the trial, Connors, of Dorchester, quietly sobbed through the evidence. The film shows blood-splattered walls her son's white sweatshirt stained brown. Three of the four accused of killing Joel ended up in prison, but Connors remembers when the fourth suspect — the one she says she believes killed her boy — was set free., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], Janet Connors: I can still hear myself screaming in the hallways of the courthouse. You're not supposed to cry now. You're not supposed to scream. The court has decided., Howard: The grief — it was eating her up. She felt compelled to talk with the young men convicted of killing her son. She petitioned the Department of Correction for a meeting with them. The department passed her request along, and one of the men, called A.J. in the film, agreed. An official says that this marks the first time a victim offender dialogue between a convict and the family of a murder victim was held through the State Department of Correction. But it would not be the last. It sent Connors on a path to a deal not only with her own grief, but to help others deal with theirs — people like A.J. He recalls being 21 when he arrived at the prison, facing a 10-year sentence., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], A.J.: I remember, I didn't sleep that whole night, my first night in Concord. The problem was I never thought I'd go home again, because I thought I'd end up killing someone in jail., Howard:  He was sent to isolation — the hole -  for getting into trouble., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], A.J.: I sold drugs in prison, and I got into fights, and I went to the hole, and I got out of the hole. I had so much time to do - being in the hole is a part of the game., Howard: But one day the monotony was broken. He got the message that Janet Connors wanted to talk. He agreed to a supervised, transcribed meeting., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], A.J.: I remember sitting across the table from her.  I think I shook her hand when I first met her, and I don't think I looked in her eye. And I had nothing to say. She told me about herself, she told me her hurt., Connors: It’s not going I didn't go in there angry, I did bring my anger, too, but I also brought — I brought pictures of Joel from the time he was a baby, all grown up, the last pictures of him and I together, the last pictures we had of him., A.J.: … And I remember going back to unit and thinking to myself, ""Whew, glad that's done."" In a month after that, I was in the hole again for drinking and getting high on my birthday. The hell do I care?, , Howard: But something about talking face-to-face with Janet Connors stayed with him for a long time., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], A.J.: And it wasn't till three or four years after that conversation that I looked at the transcripts while I was in the hole again and something hit me. It's right here in black and white. This conversation happened and this woman took a chance on you, and what the [expletive] are you doing. And I got it. And I remember just waking up in the middle night and just writing her a letter in the dark., Connors: Dear Ms. Connors. How are you? Hopefully all is well for you and your family..., Howard: That's Janet Connors in the film reading part of that letter, [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], Connors: You once gave me a tiny piece of your forgiveness. I'll do everything that I can to earn it all, bit by bit. I hope this letter isn't an intrusion. It's not meant to be a dash back into your life. I had things that I had to say and I thought that you should be the first to hear them. My very best to you, Ms. Connors., Howard: Janet Connors was moved. She enrolled in restorative justice training. One technique involves sitting in an intimate circle facing an adversary, confronting the past and starting the healing. And then she trained others, including brokenhearted mothers just like her, and they have gone beyond prisons and into other settings, like schools. Meantime, A.J., serving his time, has stayed in touch on and off with Janet Connors., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], A.J.:  Janet, to me, is a guardian angel. She gave me a chance, and I always told her I will do anything you ever ask me to do., Howard:  One thing she did ask him to do was to talk to at-risk kids, and he did. Here he is talking to students in a circle, warning them not to act in the moment like he did., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], A.J.: Just give yourselves a second to think. It's those split-second decisions that can change your [expletive] life forever. It takes two seconds. I can speak on that. Two seconds., Howard: And so, another circle comes to an end., [Sound from the film “Circle Up”], A.J.: Listen, I just want to thank you guys. Thank you for having me, thank you for allowing me to be a part of this circle. I've never done anything like this. Thank you, Janet.

381,[Screening Children And Youth For The Early Warning Signs Of Addiction],"[Click here for a radio version of this story:   , At his three pediatric offices on Cape Cod, it’s not uncommon for Dr. Leif Norenberg to meet a 12-year-old patient who smokes marijuana or a teenage girl who cuts her arms., “Years ago, I didn’t know what to do. I’d ask patients, ‘Are you anxious, are you depressed?’ I saw they were cutting and I’d say ‘Oh my gosh, what do we do?’” recalled Norenberg. “I didn’t know what to do, so we’d refer them to a counselor and they might or might not go.”, These days, there’s a clinical social worker on his team. She’s available during regular office visits to help children and youth manage everything from anxiety to drug use. Ideally, she nips the problem in the bud, but there’s also a larger goal: to identify — and treat — the early signs of addiction., “There’s a link between untreated mental health and addictive disease,” said Catie Dotolo, the social worker embedded in Norenberg’s pediatric practice. “If a young child struggled with anxiety and didn’t learn skills or tools to navigate those feelings, eventually that child could find reprieve in substance. They could use, they could drink, and, suddenly, their symptoms aren’t so bad.”, Dotolo’s work in the pediatric practice is part of a pilot project run by Gosnold on Cape Cod, a detox and addiction treatment center. Founder Ray Tamasi says most people show up at Gosnold when their addiction escalates to the point of crisis. Why not, he asks, treat addiction like heart disease or childhood asthma and, instead, take a more proactive approach?, “Think about how we treat other conditions. We try to identify early, we screen people and identify or stratify the risk,” said Tamasi. “We know there are risk factors that make people more likely to develop substance abuse disorders. We don’t do a lot about that early on."", Yet Dotolo says conditions like depression and anxiety are remarkably common. “More than 70 percent of the children that I interface with can identify the emotion of anxiety. Not all have anxiety disorders, but there is a lot of pressure today on children,"" she said., When there’s a significant mental health or substance use issue, Dotolo will refer children and families to outside help.  She deals with what, at least on the surface, might be considered the small stuff., For instance, a teenage boy smoking pot., Dotolo connected WGBH News with a 16-year-old patient who is now a junior at a Cape Cod high school. The boy, who did not want to be identified, started smoking marijuana in eighth grade. He says it was a mix of curiosity and peer pressure that led him to try to the drug, but says he continued to use it because it eased his anxiety about school., “Eighth grade, I don’t know why, but it was kind of a stressful for me. I guess [the marijuana] got rid of the stress, in a way,” he said., The boy’s mother, who also asked not to be identified, says it was clear that her son was worried about his marijuana use. Unsure what else to do, she brought him to the pediatrician’s office, where he connected with Dotolo., “Had that not happened immediately on the spot, I think we would have probably said, ‘Oh, it’s an aberration, it’s typical peer pressure. It’s everywhere, no big deal,'"" she said. ""I think she helped him put it in perspective and helped him think about [how] it is out there, and your choices make a difference in what you do with your life,"" she said., The boy said his time with Dotolo made a lasting impression, helping him prioritize his well-being and better understand his emotions., “I didn’t get what was going on, why I was feeling that way,” said the boy. “She helped me pinpoint what was really the problem and the issue.”, Leif Norenberg, the pediatrician, says having Dotolo in his office is not a magic bullet. There are still children dealing with mental health and addiction issues. But in the two years since Dotolo joined his team, he’s seen a positive impact.,  “We’ve taken kids who were not talking to parents, not going to activities, were floundering in school,” said Norenberg. ""And all of a sudden, they’re back to normal or as close to normal as any of us can be.”, Dotolo’s work is funded through a grant. Scaling this project may be difficult because insurance companies typically reimburse medical care and behavioral care separately. There’s no mechanism to pay for this kind of integrated care. , “There should be a nationwide push for this,” said Norenberg. “The world isn’t getting any less weird or less stressful.”, Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"
382,[Ending Federal Subsidies Expected To Raise Health Care Premiums],"[President Trump moved to end government subsidies for insurance companies covering low-income Americans, a decision that will raise premiums for other consumers, said MIT economist Jonathan Gruber on Boston Public Radio today., ""Instead of the government paying for them, insurers will have to,"" Gruber said. ""[Insurers] are going to raise their prices through the roof and many of them will just exit the insurance markets as a result."", He explained how insurers would previously receive government subsidy to front outstanding costs for people who can't afford their coverage., After the White House's decision yesterday, other consumers will pay the costs of those subsidies for low-income Americans through higher premiums., Gruber explained that Massachusetts will be affected in the same way as other states, saying, ""Our insurers are screwed."", ""They still need to provide these low-income protections to our citizens, but they suddenly need to finance them, which means that the premiums and the exchanges are going to have to go way up,"" said Gruber., Gruber said in addition to the decision last night, Trump signed an executive order allowing insurance companies to offer ""skinny plans"" that provide less coverage for lower costs., He noted two problems with the new allowance of skinny plans. First, that insurance companies might hide what is and isn't covered, a possibility that was not allowed under Obamacare. The second, Gruber, said, was more subjective, and was related to the ethical questions swarming the health care debate., ""Do we really want women, the mentally ill, people with cancer to have to pay a lot more for their health insurance?"" he said. ""Or do we recognize that at some point, most of us are going to have a kid or be in a family that has a kid, we're going to deal with mental illness, we're going to be at risk of cancer, and we want to make sure we're protected?"", Molly Boigon is a former associate producer and reporter for Learning Curve, WGBH’s K-12 education desk.

384,"[For One Cambridge Boy Scout Troop, Going Coed Is Nothing New]","[Barbara Howard: The Boy Scouts of America will now admit girls. After a decline in membership, the Boy Scouts board announced a unanimous vote yesterday to go coed. It will now let girls into its Cub Scouts program for younger kids, and says it plans to create a scouting program for older girls, as well. A coed Boy Scout troop is not a new concept for some Cambridge families. Nearly 15 years ago, girls were invited to join boys in a troop there, and one of the leaders was Dr. Michelle Holmes — she teaches at Harvard's School of Public Health. Dr. Holmes joins me in the studio. Thanks for coming in., Michelle Holmes: Thank you for having me., Howard: So why were girls invited into that troop back in 2003?, Holmes: Well, there were two reasons that I invited girls. One was, girls have always been hanging around. They were usually the sisters of the Boy Scouts and they were interested in the activities that their brothers were doing, mostly the outdoor activities. And the second was that I was on a camping trip with the boys once, my son was in a tent with some other boys, and somehow teenage boys think that a micron of nylon tent stops their voices. Well, it doesn't. And I heard them talking about girls in a way that I wasn't happy about, and felt like they were objectifying women in a way, and I thought they should have an experience that was more wholesome and peer-driven. So I wanted the girls to join., Howard: OK so you did this — but did you do it in full view of the Boy Scout governing body, the national body? Did they give you any push back, if they knew about it?, Holmes: I was very open all along, what we were doing. I actually wrote to the national leadership, I served on national committees, and I've always talked about it., Howard: Did the national leadership give you any grief about it?, Holmes: No, they didn't. They basically ignored us., Howard: So once you did bring girls into the troop, these boys in the tent, for example, who were making remarks that you didn't approve of, did the attitudes change?, Holmes: Absolutely, I saw a real change in their attitudes. They really have come to respect each other as peers. They develop a kind of brother-sister relationship. Sometimes people have been worried about romantic or dating relationships among the scouts, and that actually doesn't happen very much. It's much more of a sibling relationship. When you have to depend on each other to, you know, set up camp and make dinner and put up the tent, it builds respect. What I see among the young men in our troop now is that they respect the other young women as their peers and as their equals., There's been a concern that in a coed troop, girls will quote “take over.” Well in our troop, the leadership — they democratically elect leaders — has gone back and forth between boys and girls seamlessly. We haven't had to do anything about that. There's a boy leader now. There was a girl leader last semester, and we know that the leader next semester will be a girl., Howard: So what do you think of this — this nationwide move to go coed?, Holmes: I'm glad they've caught up with us. We're delighted by it., Howard: When this is played out and girls are allowed into the Boy Scouts, do you have any concerns that it's going to skim off girls from the Girl Scouts?, Holmes: You know, interestingly, around the world, scouting is coed and most of the times what happened is the boy program went coed and the girl program remained. So that single-sex option is still there for girls that want it. I believe girls deserve a choice. They can choose Girl Scouts and they can choose the Boy Scout program now, too., Howard: Well in recent years it's been a real steep decline in the membership of the Boy Scouts, and a lot of that may be driven by headlines about the Boy Scouts banning gay scout leaders and gay boys themselves. And lately, though, there's been a softening in their stance. But is it too late, though, to recover from the damage that was done in that?, Holmes: I do think that some of the membership standards that were exclusionary didn't send the right message and people would stay away. It looks like Boy Scouts are trying to make up for last time and be more inclusionary., Howard: Is the name Boy Scouts going to need to change?, Holmes: I wonder about that., Howard: What would you like to see it called?, Holmes: Scouts of America., Howard: Thank you so much for coming in, Dr. Holmes., Holmes: Thank you., Holmes: That's Dr. Michelle Holmes. Nearly 15 years ago, she was a leader in her son's Boy Scout troop in Cambridge when girls were invited to join., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

390,[Indoor Farming Grows In Greater Boston],"[Indoor farming is an industry that continues to grow — and not just your greenhouse variety, either — but a close cousin that uses no sunlight or pesticides, little water, and a whole lot of technology., Inside an old ginger ale factory in Millis, Freshbox Farms has 8-by-40 foot containers lined up, each connected to a water purification and air filtration system. Inside every container is a hydroponic farm growing an acre’s worth of leafy greens. But, before we can even enter one, the company’s senior vice-president of plant science and product development, Deane Falcone, and I suit up in lab coats and hair nets so we don’t bring in insects that can damage the plants., Inside, rows of lustrous, leafy green romaine lettuce greet us from trays of water. Each section is in a different stage of growth ranging from two weeks to harvest time, which occurs at five weeks. The company also monitors the soil and air conditions, which is captured every 30 seconds with software created in-house, This romaine lettuce receives 16 hours of fake sunshine from LED lights and uses about 18,000 gallons of water in an entire year, a fraction of what traditional lettuce farms use. Hydroponic farming has long been regarded for its water efficiency but critics of indoor farming like this say the cost to power the LED lights is hard to justify. Falcone agrees that it’s costly but cites Haitz’s Law, which predicts the efficiency of LED lights to increase exponentially every decade., “So we're paying for a lot of electricity to power up a lot of the LED lights,” he said. “The thing that we always point to is the fact that the efficiency of the LEDs is increasing every couple of years.”, The cost factor is something the founders of Freight Farms, a local startup, considered when they started turning shipping containers into pre-fabricated vertical farms that require only one layer of lighting on each side. They’re called Leafy Green Machines., It was one of the draws for Bobby Zuker and Chris Mutty, who bought one of these containers. Together they launched Greenline Growers, right out of a former taxi depot in Coolidge Corner, Brookline., “We started in December of 2015,” Zuker said. “That was when we got our first Freight Farm. And then by March we were actually selling to restaurants.”, Greenline Growers now has three vertical farms. Freight Farms sells these Leafy Green Machines to budding farmers like Zuker and Mutty for $85,000. They also provide training and now an app that allows users to control settings remotely., “They've taken a lot of different technologies and aggregated it and made it fairly simple to automate it and then we just do the farming part.” Zuker said., Tim Griffin of the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts, said this latest iteration of urban agriculture could diversify the food supply as weather becomes more erratic., “I see it as being it's another way that we grow food and if it works really well with particular foods, then we should be thinking about how we should be thinking in a positive way,” he added. “And then [we should] also always [be] thinking about who has access to what and who does not.”, Even though we won’t be seeing corn or wheat grown in these things, that doesn’t rule out strawberries and even someday rice and grapes to go with the ever-growing varieties of lettuce. , Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

396,[Author Who Inspired 'Hamilton' Has A New Muse: Ulysses S. Grant ],"[Pulitzer Prize-winning Biographer Ron Chernow’s book ""Hamilton"" spurred Lin-Manuel Miranda to write a musical based on the book and the life of Alexander Hamilton. ""Hamilton"" captured the public conscious unlike any musical in recent memory. Now, Chernow has written a new biography of Ulysses S. Grant simply called ""Grant."" Chernow joined Boston Public Radio Wednesday to talk about his new book, the influence of Grant, and how Lin Manuel Miranda approached him about ""Hamilton."" Below are some highlights from that conversation. , Why did you decide Ulysses S. Grant for the subject of this book? , There is a contrarian streak in my nature. When I wrote about Alexander Hamilton, he was quite demonized at that time and I felt that he had been done in by his adversaries. I wrote the Grant book in a similar spirit. There were really three leading myths that I wanted to retire. One: this idea that he was this hopeless drunkard who stumbled through the civil war in an alcoholic haze. Two: that he was this crude and brutal butcher as a general. Three: that he was a failed president and that the entire presidency was all about corruption and cronyism., Why does our country not recognize Grant more for his many accomplishments as a president?, What happened during the civil war and Reconstruction — there was a school of Southern historians that were called the Lost Cause School, and they retrospectively rewrote the history of the Civil war and Reconstruction. They said that the Civil War was not really about slavery, it was about states' rights. They said that Reconstruction was a complete fiasco of corrupt carpet bag politicians and illiterate and incompetent black legislators. In fact, most historians consider Reconstruction a glorious period in which we tried to create a biracial society., Did Grant just get lucky during the many battles of the Civil War, or was he actually a great general?, The Confederate historians always said, of course, Grant had access to manpower and manufacturing in the North that was so much greater than the South. If you look at the war in Virginia before Grant in 1864 finally faces off against Lee, there had been six consecutive Union generals who had not been able to defeat Robert E. Lee with the same Northern population, with the same Northern manufacturing power. Grant not only defeats him, but captures his army., Do you feel like you actually know Grant after writing this book?, By the time I sit down and write about someone, I have to feel that if this person walked into the room right now, I would know how he walked, talked, looked and sounded. After a while you know the person so well you can almost predict what they will do or say in a given situation., How did you and Lin-Manuel Miranda meet?, I live in Brooklyn Heights in New York, and one Sunday afternoon I was out walking I ran into a friend whose daughter went to Wesleyan with Lin, and it was this life changing conversation. He said, ""This hip-hop artist Lin-Manuel Miranda has read your Hamilton book, he fell in love with it."" He put me in touch with Lin. I went to see Lin, who was still staring in his first show, ""In The Heights."" I went backstage and Lin told me while he was reading my Hamilton book on vacation in Mexico, hip-hop songs started rising off the page. Then he said to me, ""Hamilton’s life was a classic hip-hop narrative."" I was thinking to myself, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Lin picked up on the fact that he had a world class ignoramus about hip-hop on his hands. I said to him, ""Can hip-hop be the vehicle for telling this story?"" And he said, ""Ron I’m going to educate you in hip-hop."", What was your first reaction to hearing ""Hamilton""?, [Lin-Manuel Miranda] came up to my house and he sang the opening number, which is four minutes long, and when he finished he said, ""What do you think?"" I said, ""That’s the most amazing thing I’ve ever heard. You’ve compressed the first 40 pages of my book into a four-minute song."" What I didn’t say to him was, Pal, either you write very tight, or I write very long., This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

400,[A Black Church In Boston Says It's Called To Be A Sanctuary  ],"[, First-time visitors to Sunday morning services at Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston are met with smiles, handshakes and even hugs. To call it a warm welcome would be an understatement. , Bethel AME is no stranger to political activism. But the mostly African American congregation has taken up a new mission. In late September, the parish decided to give shelter to a man from El Salvador facing deportation. , Church officials turned down a request for a face-to-face interview with the man, a father of five, who’s now living at Bethel AME. But Rev. Ray Hammond explained the church's thinking behind becoming a sanctuary church. , “This is not a political issue. Ultimately it's a human issue,” says Hammond, who co-founded Bethel AME with his wife, Gloria White-Hammond, a fellow physician and pastor herself. The couple started the church in 1989. It has done work on various social justice issues, including with youth, prisoners and the impoverished., “For a number of years, we've been concerned about the immigration crisis in our country,” Hammond says. “We've been deeply concerned about the way in which the immigration issue — rather than being dealt with honestly, openly, justly, humanely — has become increasingly a political football.” , Hammond says he was a little surprised at how much support there was among congregants for taking this latest step. , “I expected perhaps more opposition. Historically, sometimes there has been tension between the African American and Latino community, between what African Americans see as ‘native-born’ versus ‘immigrant,’” Hammond says.  A couple members of the congregation expressed some doubts about giving shelter to someone at risk of being deported, Hammond adds. But that was about it. , “The vote was almost unanimous to support it. And people certainly wanted to understand the protocols and how we're going to make sure that this work. But the support was overwhelming,” Hammond says. , It’s not clear what legal options remain for the man facing deportation. A request to interview his lawyer was declined. , A spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement also turned down an invitation to speak on the record, but on background he pointed to guidelines put in place by previous administrations that prohibit federal agents from entering sensitive locations to make arrests, such as churches, schools or hospitals, under most circumstances. , Still, the ICE spokesman said that churches giving sanctuary to someone with a deportation order might be committing a felony offense by harboring a fugitive. , The Trump administration appears to be targeting sanctuary, jurisdictions that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities. , Over four days in late September, federal agents conducted a national operation inside 10 sanctuary cities, arresting nearly 500 people, including 50 in the Boston area. , The acting director of ICE, Tom Homan said in a news release that sanctuary cities, “are shielding criminal aliens from immigration enforcement and creating a magnet for illegal immigration. As a result, ICE is forced to dedicate more resources to conduct at-large arrests in these communities.”, Religious leaders from around Boston meet to talk about what some see as a heavy-handed crackdown by the federal government on immigrant communities. , Matthew Bell , Bethel AME is not acting alone. It's part of a coalition of three local churches and three synagogues, all contributing to the effort to provide sanctuary for the undocumented man from El Salvador. At least one other church in the Boston area has declared itself as a sanctuary. , Over the summer, University Lutheran Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said it was providing shelter to a woman from Ecuador, along with her two children, who feared deportation.  , Religious leaders are busy working on what comes next. Last week, clergy from several different faith traditions met at St. Paul’s Episcopal Cathedral in downtown Boston to sing, pray and talk about how their communities might be willing to respond to what some see as a looming crackdown on immigration. , People see this issue as a fight for the nation’s soul, says Rev. Arrington Chambliss, a priest with Episcopal City Mission in Boston. , “Words without action are empty,” Chambliss says. , “We’re in a particular moment in our history,” she adds. “There is a very pernicious and focused threat on particular communities.” , “It’s not trying to be in conflict with anyone, but it’s being instead in deep relationship with our neighbor.”, From PRI's The World ©2017 PRI]"

406,[Forbes Under 30 Summit Brings Inspiration To Boston Schools],"[Nik Ingersoll is making a living off bananas, which comes as an inspiration to the students of Fenway High School., “I think it’s amazing how you can turn a small little interest into something so big and powerful, just from thinking of bananas,” said Delilah Barros, a senior at Fenway., Ingersoll is the co-founder and chief marketing officer of Barnana, a brand of organic banana-based snacks on a mission to end food waste by turning the more unattractive bananas — those that are bruised, scuffed, a little too ripe, or a little too small — that often are tossed out on banana farms into healthy snacks. He was also named to the Forbes’ 30 Under 30 food and drink list in 2016., Ingersoll spoke to Barros and other students as part of this year’s Forbes Under 30 summit service day. The fourth annual summit was held this week in Boston for the second consecutive year and brought together big names such as rapper Kendrick Lamar, Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman, Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe, and thousands of other young influencers and entrepreneurs.  , Several summit attendees wrapped up a week of networking and speeches by volunteering to visit various elementary, middle and high schools across the city to inspire Boston’s school children to think about innovation and entrepreneurship. Some simply spoke about their work, some participated in a hackathon with students, and others helped students work through a mobile math lab., Ingersoll spoke to the students not only about his career path, but also about how his interests in sports and healthy eating led him to co-found Barnana. He says it was important for him to speak to the students at Fenway because of his upbringing. Ingersoll grew up in a small town in western Nebraska, where he says it was hard for people to imagine leaving the area., “It was super isolated. No one really escaped that area and did anything like [what I’m doing] before,” Ingersoll said. “I never had access to even ask questions to someone that would walk around in my shoes then. I would’ve given anything to have that.”, The students took full advantage of the opportunity to ask Ingersoll their burning questions — everything from whether he knows any celebrities (because he lives in Los Angeles) to why it’s important raise money to start a business, how to pay attention to buying trends, and how to get the most out of college., Ingersoll says he felt like he could relate to the students. Many students at Fenway will be first-generation college students, as he was., Hearing how Ingersoll transformed his unique interests and passions into a career will help the students learn to think outside of the box when it comes to choosing a career, said Morgan DesPrez, the director of Fenway's Ventures program, which introduces students to professionals from different fields., “One of our mottos here is to try things on, and I think that’s exactly what we want our students to leave with — the idea that you’re curious about lots of different things and you’re willing to pursue or take something you don’t know a lot about, but are curious about, and delve into it a little bit more,” she said.,  , , Ryan Inchaustegui, a senior who is interested in a career combining business and sports, received encouraging words from Ingersoll., “He told me, ‘You can be it, as long as you’re dedicated and you pay your hard work for it, anything is possible,’” Inchaustegui said. “I try to relate myself to him, and when he was explaining his story, there was no [stopping]. In college, he wanted to do … design, and then he became [a chief marketing officer]. And then I asked him what his future is … he just said he goes with the flow, and there really is no [stopping]. He’s going to continue to be the best he can be. So that’s something that I connect to.”, , Ingersoll says in addition to hard work and dedication, surviving in a business-minded world isn’t just about having a passion — it’s about understanding your passion on a deeper level and finding a way to make money off it. He added that practical business savvy is vital to helping students succeed in the real world., “I think there’s too much focus on putting kids into boxes and making them a corporate robot worker ant for a giant bureaucratic system, and that’s the only option,” Ingersoll said. “I think that practical business classes and really explaining the way business works, it’s astounding to me that that’s not part of the [standard] curriculum.”, Paris Alston is a former Digital Production Assistant for WGBH News.]"

408,[Iranian Doctor Arrives In Boston To Do Research After 8-Month Travel Ban Delay],"[Barbara Howard: The Boston medical community relies on overseas talent for research breakthroughs. Last week, after an eight-month wait, Dr. Seyed Saravi arrived at Logan Airport. His visa had been suspended shortly after President Trump took office in the wake of the first travel ban. Saravi was to work on the effects of diabetes on the heart in the lab of Dr. Thomas Michel of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. And Dr. Michel is with me here in the studio. Thanks for coming in, Dr. Michel., Thomas Michel: It's my pleasure., Howard: So tell me about the work Dr. Saravi was being brought in to do., Michel: Well he has particular expertise in understanding the factors that control the contraction of the heart. Specifically, studying the heart muscle in rats, and his expertise and the interests of my lab coincided very nicely. And when he sent me an e-mail requesting an appointment as a post-doctoral fellow, we began a long dialogue that ultimately led to his being accepted as a post-doctoral fellow in my lab., Howard: Well, then there was an eight-month delay. He only arrived last week. Did that delay complicate things for your lab?, Michel: Without a doubt. And I think that there's a broader issue here, which is the whole effect of the suppression of interest in coming to the United States to pursue training and to have international scientific communication, which is a consequence of the travel ban and other statements made by the administration, which I think have a chilling effect., Howard: Are you finding fewer people willing to come?, Michel: I think that that is beginning to be perceived. There has been a decrease in the applications at the collegiate level for students to come to study at U.S. universities, concerned about the current climate for foreign nationals, particularly those of color. And I think that it's only a matter of time before the shift in preeminence of American science away from these borders to other countries will be seen. And I think the impact will be very profound. American bio medicine traditionally has relied upon an exchange of ideas and of individuals across borders. Science knows no boundaries. There are, of course, issues of security, to which I'm not insensitive, but I think that their pursuit of knowledge and in the interests of health, is something that really should be an international endeavor., Howard: Well you yourself, though, in your lab – how has that had an effect on you?, Michel: Well I think that it’s had, principally, a negative effect, and that the foreign post-doctoral fellows in my lab, some of whom are European and look like anyone else you might see, are actually themselves frightened that something may happen where their ability to pursue training might be undermined., Howard: Are they less inclined to travel?, Michel: Without a doubt, anyone who's coming from a country that is affected by the ban is unable to travel. I know of several examples where students have chosen to go to other universities in other countries rather than come to the U.S. and perhaps be precluded from traveling home to see their families., Howard: Now there were some other Iranian researchers who were mentioned who allegedly had connections to various militia and that sort of thing that seemed to have shut down their visas, but this wasn't true for Dr. Saravi., Michel: Dr. Saravi had already undergone a very extensive vetting process before he even got his visa. It was eight months of background checks and of very thorough investigations by federal agencies. Indeed for Dr. Saravi, the actions of the courts served to, I think, in part result in the restoration of his visa. I also contacted my congresswoman, Katherine Clark, and senators Markey and Warren, and their offices were involved. I don't know exactly with whom and when. I also know that the publicity that this case brought when it was first made public that Dr. Saravi was going to be unable to come because of the suspension of his visa led to several lawyers and law firms offering pro bono services, and he was part of a class action lawsuit that helped restore his visa., Howard: Tell me what it was like when you were at Logan Airport, when he finally stepped off the plane., Michel: Well he had been anticipated by my lab and several other colleagues and we knew that it was going to be a bit of a delay from when the plane was expected to arrive and when he'd stepped through the doors into American territory, as it were. I brought along my accordion and we played patriotic songs and some Iranian songs. So it was a very exciting and upbeat time, and all the while I was keeping an eye out on the door to see when he might come through, because I'd never met him in person. We had had hundreds of emails and Skype conversations over the last year and a half, but I'd never met in person, so it was wonderful to see him., Howard: So how is he doing now?, Michel: He is elated. He's excited and he's ready to go., Howard: OK. Thanks so much for joining us, Dr. Michel., Michel: Thank you., Howard: That’s Dr. Thomas Michel. He runs a cardiovascular lab affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Last week, after an eight-month wait, he was able to greet an Iranian doctor who was slated to do work in his lab, Dr. Seyed Saravi, at Logan Airport. , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

He, along with his team, submitted Ixcuna’s final application. Carrera says he started the process with many DACA recipients and felt it was important to be a part of what is the final application for many., “This was a very important piece for us because we did a lot of original applications. We did over 350,"" he said., That was when DACA was first started in 2012. But during this last wave of renewals, Carrera says his staff only helped with 50 applications. He wonders if everyone who can renew has actually filed an application., “This is a country that’s really included them, embraced them, and now, suddenly, because there’s a change in political climate, suddenly they’re being forced back into the shadows,"" he said., The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that it does not share DACA information with immigration enforcement — meaning is someone has not renewed their status, the information will not be passed over to start the deportation process, unless the person has committed a crime. , Ixcuna says she wants to stay, continue her education and raise her a 2-and-a-half-year-old son.

They’ve come into the public eye in recent days because twelve of the rifles used by Stephen Paddock in the mass shooting in Las Vegas were outfitted with bump stocks., Capuano said he was heartened by the fact regulation is even being discussed, since it hadn’t come up in the wake of the Orlando shooting, an instance during which bump stocks were also used., “This is not the first time these devices have been used in a mass murder. A few years ago, they were used in Orlando,” he said. “At the time, there was no discussion of it. If this is what it takes to finally make some progress on the issue, I guess I’m happy, but we’ll see.”, Capuano explained that one obstacle to the reform might be the influence of the NRA, since they grade legislators based on their votes on gun reform bills. The NRA has endorsed regulating bump stocks, and Capuano speculated that Republicans might have contacted the NRA before speaking out in favor of regulation., “I presume that some of the Republicans who have spoken out probably checked with the NRA before they spoke out. Now I don’t know that obviously and I hope I’m wrong, but if they checked with them, maybe the NRA realizes finally that on this one, maybe they have to make some movement,” he said. “Again, we’ll see.”, Congressman Mike Capuano joins BPR regularly for A Look Behind The Curtain, his running list of executive actions that have big consequences but aren’t getting a lot of play.

418,[Boston Bar Association Makes Recommendations For Criminal Justice Reform ],"[The Boston Bar Association recently released a set of recommendations earlier this week meant to help decrease the number of people entering the state's criminal justice system. The full report, titled ""No Time to Wait,"" can be found on the Association's website here. Kathy Weinman of the Boston Bar Association joined WGBH's All Things Considered host Barbara Howard to further discuss these recommendations. Below is a transcript of their conversation. To listen to their conversation, click on the audio player above., Barbara Howard: Incarceration rates for blacks and Hispanics in Massachusetts far exceed the rates for whites. That's according to the Boston Bar Association, which has joined the call for judicial reform.This, just as State Senate leaders introduce reform measures aimed at cutting back on the number of those who are entering the court system, including raising the age of majority from 18 to 19, and the so-called Romeo and Juliet law which decriminalized is consensual sex between minors. But the main focus is on mandatory drug sentencing. That leaves judges with no leeway when it comes to putting people — even addicts — in prison. Here is Kathy Weinman of the Boston Bar Association., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH KATHY WEINMAN), Kathy Weinman: About 75 percent of those in state prison who are serving under these mandatory minimum laws are people of color., Howard: Weinman says that giving sentencing discretion back to the judges is key, but that's just the start when it comes to the Boston Bar Association’s six-point judicial reform plan released earlier this week. Weinman says at the Boston Bar Association's recommendations are both cost-effective and promised better outcomes. She points to nonviolent offenders who often end up in prison because they cannot post bail. She says there's a better way., (INTERVIEW WITH KATHY WEINMAN), Kathy Weinman: Make an assessment about whether they pose a flight risk or are dangerous to their communities. If not, they would be released until they —, Howard: Have a court date., Weinman: Have a court date —, Howard: Because it costs money to keep him behind bars., Weinman: Exactly. It costs money and [it] also interferes with their daily lives, with their family lives. That's a big problem., Howard: So you're not talking about people who are flight risks or dangers. You're talking about people who just can't afford to post bail., Weinman: Yes., Howard: You're also talking about putting in place pre-trial diversion to talk about that., Weinman: Pre-trial diversion, which is in place in a number of our counties, permits people who have not committed violent crimes from going into the criminal justice system at all. They are charged with a crime, but they're not arraigned and they participate in programs., Howard: These aren't violent criminals., Weinman: These are not violent criminals., Howard: So what kind of programs will they be doing?, Weinman: So it might be a drug abuse program, cognitive therapy — there is a wide variety., Howard: And this is just for people who are found not to be in immediate danger you’re talking about., Weinman: Yes., Howard: OK, so that alleviates the courts, it alleviates the jails, and that part is done. Sometimes people who enter the system face fines, face fees that they just don't have the money to pay. And that can put them behind bars, as well., Weinman: It certainly can. What we're asking is that before any fees or fines are assessed, that the judges determine whether in fact the person can afford to pay them., Howard: You would like to see some of the re-entry programs expanded that already are in place. One is about the CORI laws that sometimes prevent people from getting meaningful employment. Talk about CORI. CORI, of course, is the Criminal Offender Record Information. Talk about that., Weinman: So for 10 years after people have served felony sentences and for five years after misdemeanor sentences, employers may get access to records of convictions. That interferes with their ability to get jobs. And a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank confirmed it's much more difficult in Massachusetts for people to find employment because of these laws., Howard: Now some would say though, 'Felony convictions, maybe they want to drive a school bus. I don't want that guy around my kids.' What kinds of people are we talking about here?, Weinman: So there certainly are special categories of employers. Schools generally would continue, under our proposal, to have the greatest access to that information., Howard: So CORI standards make employment difficult, so for people who can't get jobs to support themselves, do they go back to the life of crime?, Weinman: Absolutely. If you can't support yourself lawfully then the alternative is crime. So our recommendation is simply to reduce those periods from 10 years and five years to five years and three years. And there are studies that demonstrate that someone who has been crime-free for those periods is no more likely to commit a crime than people who have never been involved in the criminal justice system at all., Howard: That's Kathy Weinman of the Boston Bar Association., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
419,[Red Sox Playoff Preview],"[WGBH's All Things Considered host Barbara Howard spoke with Boston Globe baseball reporter Alex Speier about the Red Sox playoff series against the Houston Astros, which gets underway Thursday. Below is a transcript of their conversation. To listen to their conversation, click on the audio player above., Barbara Howard: The Red Sox kick off their postseason tomorrow afternoon in Houston, Game One of the American League Divisional Series against the Astros. Joining us with a preview of that series is Alex Speier — he covers baseball for the Boston Globe. Hi, Alex., Alex Speier: Hi, Barbara., Howard: So the Red Sox head into the playoffs as division champs. They did come out on top in the American League East, but they didn't exactly finish the regular season with a bang: they lost three out of their final four games to these very same Houston Astros that they're about to play in the best-of-five series. And the Astros, they have a formidable offense. They scored more runs than any other team in baseball this season. So Alex, can the Red Sox starting pitchers keep them at bay? Ace Chris Sale — he gets the start tomorrow, and he was a little bit inconsistent down the stretch., Speier: He was, though of course, it's a bet that the Red Sox are probably pretty comfortable making on Sale. Look, there are no guarantees in the Astros' offense, as you point out. Extraordinary. They scored more runs this year than any team in baseball since 2009. But, they, you know, Chris Sale has a long history of excellence against them. And he hasn’t faced them this year, which actually plays into his favor. He was one of the pitchers who did not pitch against them in this past year. So the Red Sox are hopeful that he'll get them out off to a good start. They will turn to Drew Pomeranz in the second game of the series. Pomeranz was very good against the Astros in his final start of the season on Saturday, and then they're still determining who else will round out the rotation. But it is a tall task., Howard: How do you think the Sox batters will handle Houston's pitching?, Speier: Houston also has an impressive front, too. Justin Verlander is going to be pitching against Sale in game one, and he's one of the best pitchers, really of this baseball generation, followed by Dallas Keuchel, a guy who has a fantastic beard and also won the Cy Young Award in 2015. So the Red Sox have their work cut out for them offensively. They've struggled at times offensively this year. They're going to have to find a way to have the kind of timely hitting that often alluded them this year. But it is a very tough Red Sox team that's been surprisingly adept at finding ways to win games in which their offense was just kind of able to scratch and claw together a few runs, thanks to their pitching staff., Howard: Well one real bright spot for the Sox this season has been the bullpen. I understand that's not so much the case for the Astros, right?, Speier: The Astros have some very good pitchers at the back end who have great stuff, but haven't been ... nearly as consistent as the Red Sox were through the course of 2017. The Astros do sometimes lose games in which they have the lead, whereas the Red Sox did a pretty good job of putting a stranglehold on games in which they were either tied or had a lead in the late innings. The Red Sox bullpen really was remarkable, historically good from the perspective of the franchise's history this year. It was a remarkable performance that allowed them to win 15 of 18 extra inning games this year. That's the reason why the Red Sox are in the playoffs, because of their bullpen, really., Howard: So given all that, do the Sox, you think, have a decent chance this series?, Speier: Any team has a chance, has a decent chance if they're in a short postseason series. The best team doesn't always win in the postseason. I think that on paper, the Astros are a deeper, better-balanced team than the Red Sox, but in the best-of-five scenario, that best team doesn't always win. Last year, the Red Sox were a better team on paper than was [the Cleveland Indians] entering in the American League Division Series. The Red Sox lost three games, three straight games, and found their season coming to a very abrupt conclusion. So anything can happen in this context., Howard: If the Red Sox do not advance — if they lose in the series to the Astros — could it be curtains for manager John Farrell? It would be the second straight year that the Sox made an early exit from the playoffs., Speier: It's hard for me to reach that conclusion based on the fact that I think it's kind of remarkable achievement that the Red Sox won the American League East, given the overall shape of their roster, one that withstood a ton of injuries over the course of this season and had to adapt on the fly frequently. And also because of what we were just talking about  — the Astros are probably the better team on paper, but you never know. That's kind of a closed loop of discussions that happens between the ownership level and the president of baseball operations and the team president. It can be difficult to read those tea leaves, but I think that based on what's happened in 2017, that would be an awfully difficult decision to reach., Howard: OK. Thanks for joining us, Alex., Speier: Thanks, Barbara., Howard: That's Alex Speier, he covers baseball for the Boston Globe. The Red Sox take on the Astros in Game One of the American League divisional series tomorrow afternoon in Houston., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

427,[Brandeis University Scientist Wins Nobel Prize In Medicine],"[Barbara Howard: Well Ranier Weiss is not the only local researcher to be awarded a Nobel Prize this week. Yesterday, it was Brandeis University's Michael Rosbash and Jeffrey Hall taking a bow. They, along with their research partner, Michael Young of Rockefeller University in New York, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research into circadian rhythms — the body's internal clock. Dr. Rosbash is on the line. Thanks for joining us., Rosbash: My pleasure., Howard: Now you got the news, I'm told, at about 5:00 yesterday morning. What was it like to wake up to something like that?, Rosbash: 5:10 to be precise. It was shocking, because when the phone rings at that time in the morning, which happens maybe once every decade, it usually means a death in the family or something awful. So that was my first thought. And then when I picked up the phone, a gentleman with a Swedish accent introduced himself and told me what it was about, and it took my breath away — but in a slightly different, more positive manner., Howard: Did you believe it?, Rosbash: I did believe it, because I was aware that this was the morning, and it did quickly go through my mind whether it was a prank. But everybody is a little older now, and so they would worry about giving a heart attack to the recipient or something like that. So we're a bit more of a mature crowd, so I figured it wasn't a prank., Howard: Now you were studying, of course, circadian rhythms, that's what you won the Nobel for. Can you put in layman's terms the significance of the research you've been doing?, Rosbash: This research was done in fruit flies, and we were trying to understand the nature of the clock in fruit flies. And it turned out that what we discovered was a feedback loop mechanism whereby a very important protein inhibited its own production, and when, then, that protein decayed away, then the inhibition decayed away and the whole process started over again, and it took 24 hours to go around the cycle. And we were very fortunate for two reasons: first of all, it turned out that the same proteins and the same mechanism works in mammals, including in humans. We didn't discover that. It just so happened that other people working at the time were able to take our findings and apply them to humans, and lo and behold, it's exactly the same system — meaning of course, that it existed in a common ancestor of humans and fruit flies. And secondly, it turns out that this clock turns out to govern more than half of the gene expression in all tissues in all animals including humans and mice and so forth so. So in fact, the clock has its fingers in everything from libido to blood pressure., Howard: And all living things from fruit flies to people, it sounds like?, Rosbash: All living things. Exactly, exactly., , Howard: Well your research — decades studying circadian rhythms — it was at times publicly mocked by other researchers. What was that like?, Rosbash: I didn't take that too personally, and also, it became pretty clear pretty early on that we were on to something that was interesting and important, so I don't think that phase lasted very long. As I said yesterday in a press conference here at Brandeis, you know, scientists really work like a potter or like — it's a craft. And so nobody is in this for — nobody should be in this for end game. If things work out, it's really extra., Howard: Well, you know, when you were speaking with the media, you were very specific in thanking your children. You mentioned that your work occasionally got in the way of your family life. Talk about that., Rosbash: Most people who do this, who do this job, and doing research and running a lab in a significant way are pretty obsessive. The Provost yesterday here told me that she refers to this as nerding out. So when your kids are talking to you and sometimes they can see this vacant look in your eye and you have started to daydream and think about an experiment when you, of course, you should be focused on the moment, which is really paying attention to what they have to say. Fortunately, they're good, resilient kids and they both drag me back to reality — ‘Dad. Pay attention. I'm talking to you' — and forgive me for those weak moments., Howard: Well they're seeing the big payoff now, I would think., Rosbash: They saw the payoff before, I was pretty engaged dad., Howard: Well, you're 73 now and this, of course, is a crowning achievement. Do you feel like you still have more work to do, or are you ready to pass the baton to others in the field?, Rosbash: Many of our students and post-docs have run their own labs now. On the one hand, we already have passed the baton off and Jeff is retired, and I think if I if I weren't still so generously supported by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, I might well consider retiring myself. That support continues and will for a while yet, and so I think as long as that persists, I will continue. I'm still engaged and interested and I think I'll continue for a while yet., Howard: OK, well thank you for joining us, Dr. Rosbash., Rosbash: You're more than welcome. My pleasure., Howard: That's Dr. Michael Rosebash of Brandeis University. He and his Brandeis colleague Jeffrey Hall and the research partner Michael Young of Rockefeller University in New York won the Nobel Prize in medicine yesterday for their work studying circadian rhythms., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
428,[MIT Professor Among 3 Winners For Nobel Prize In Physics],"[Good things seem to happen for Rainer Weiss at 5 a.m., This morning, still in bed, his wife picked up the phone. It was the Nobel Prize committee. With a chuckle, Weiss admits he and his wife were “in the nude” when they found out he'd won. ""Now that you asked, I'm telling you,"" he said., Two years ago, in September, it was also around 5 a.m. when two massive instruments Weiss' team had built heard a little chirp. That sound, it was later confirmed, was a passing gravitational wave., A gravitational wave is a tiny distortion in time and space caused by a huge and violent event in the universe. The wave they detected was caused by two black holes colliding 1.3 billion years ago., Albert Einstein had predicted the existence of gravitational waves almost exactly 100 years ago, but he thought it would be virtually impossible to detect., Weiss and his colleague proved Einstein’s theory right, but his measurement concerns wrong. They measured the tiny distortion, which was just one-ten-thousandth the diameter of a proton., ""If Einstein was still alive, it would be absolutely wonderful to go to him and tell him about the discovery. He would have been very pleased, I am sure of that,"" Weiss said. “But then if we told him what the discovery was – that it was a black hole – he would have been absolutely flabbergasted."", , For his part, Weiss says he was flabbergasted to win the Nobel Prize. , ""To be put in the same category as some of the giants of physics, that's sort of unbelievable,"" he said., He thinks the measurement tools he and his colleagues have built and their ability to pinpoint where in the sky the black holes were will clear the way for future discoveries., ""We've opened a new field in astronomy and astrophysics,” said Weiss. “I think that’s the fundamental thing that's so new about this."", Weiss says his advice to young scientists is to surround yourself with people who believe in you. That's what he learned after flunking out of MIT as a student. Now, Rainer Weiss has been a professor at MIT for nearly 40 years., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

We won’t hold people for ICE, we won’t be a part of the Trump deportation machine, and I think it’s really important that we pursue that.”, Rose noted that the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled last month that there is no legal basis for state law enforcement to hold someone for ICE., , She said another way to manage federal immigration actions that don’t align with the state's is through the court system and through the legislature., “It’s going to the state legislature to pass laws like the Safe Communities Act or similar laws that would basically say, we won’t violate the [federal] law, but we’ll go right up to the edge, and say that we in Massachusetts aren’t going to target people who haven’t committed a crime,” she said. “Overstaying your visa is not, in fact, a crime, so a third of the people they’d picked up had committed no crime.”, Carol Rose is the Executive Director of the ACLU.

436,[Regulations Force Boston Churches to Cut Back Solar Plan],"[Lawmakers on Beacon Hill are hearing arguments Tuesday about the value of solar energy. And several churches in Dorchester and Roxbury are paying attention. The churches have had to scale back on their plans to put solar panels on their roofs and share the power with their congregations., Reverend Mariama White-Hammond walked around the corner of the Bethel AME church in Dorchester to the front of the building and pointed up. “Here is the roof with our solar panels,” she said. The panels cover one whole section of the church’s roof., “For us, you know, the sun is a gift from God,"" Hammond said. ""We like the idea that, you know, God is powering our church every Sunday.”, Bethel AME teamed up with four other churches in a plan to buy the panels. On top of powering the church buildings, they thought the project would generate extra power they could share. “Our goal was to donate some of that energy to low-income folks in our community and in our congregation,” Hammond said., The churches were also going to help pay for the panels by sending some of the extra power they generated into the power grid and selling it to the utility company., But here’s where they ran into a problem — one that’s impacting a range of solar projects in lower-income communities. In the spring of 2016, as they were working on their plan, a change in state regulations severely cut the amount they’d get paid for that power., Ben Underwood of Resonant Energy, which coordinated the solar project for the churches, used an analogy here. He said it’s like buying land to start a tomato garden. Getting a loan to do that could depend on how much you could sell your tomatoes for., “We're in a funny situation where the value of a tomato is highly contentious and is affected and influenced by policy and not just supply and demand,"" he said. ""What happened is, basically, we had started this project. You could say we bought the land thinking we're going to able to sell tomatoes at a certain price. And about halfway through the development process, the value of tomatoes was reduced by 40 percent.”  , , When the price of solar power got slashed, it slowed the whole process down – and two of the churches dropped out of the plan. Bethel AME, St. Augustine and St. Martin in Roxbury, and the Second Church in Dorchester had to scale back their plans to get below a certain size limit so they could still get the full retail price for power. In the end, the scope of the project was cut roughly in half., Hammond said that meant they don’t have extra power to share with the community., “Now we don't even have enough to cover the needs of the church itself,” she said., The regulatory change also cut payments for programs that let low-income people buy into community solar projects that are not at their homes., “When I think about what could have been possible at this campus, what could have been possible for people who could really use a break on their electricity bill, I just wonder if we've put the wrong people's interests first,” Hammond said., But should energy generated by rooftop solar panels cost the same as the power you usually buy from utility companies? Ashley Brown of Harvard University’s Electricity Policy Group says no. Brown says people with panels on their roofs aren’t providing what he calls a full retail product., “Meaning 24/7 guaranteed service, all the distribution services, all the billing services, the maintenance services, all the meter reading — everything for a combined service,"" Brown said. ""All they were providing was energy.”, And, unsurprisingly, that power is generated in the daytime. Brown says that’s off-peak., “Which means we're providing energy at a time the system didn't need it as much, and when the prices for energy were much lower,” he said., On top of that, Brown said its actually better for low-income people if the price paid for solar power is cut, because it's disproportionately poorer people subsidizing solar panels on the homes of wealthier people., “So solar, just historically rooftop solar, has been an economic detriment to low-income people,” said Brown., State Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz sees the issue quite differently. She said the current state policy means municipal projects and individual homes with solar panels are being paid significantly more for their power than community solar projects for low-income people. And she has introduced legislation that she says would level that playing field., “The bill would require that, for community solar projects that are selling to low-income residents, that those communities' solar projects are compensated by the utility at the full retail rate equivalent with a private homeowner, equivalent with a municipal solar energy project,” Chang-Diaz said., The bill would also increase the number of projects that qualify for that kind of payment. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

438,[Mass. General Doctor On Mass Casualty Events],"[Barbara Howard: Las Vegas hospitals were flooded last night with hundreds of victims of the shooting on the city's strip coming in. Doctors and nurses scrambling to save lives after some were shot, others had broken limbs or were trampled. With us in the studio is Dr. David King. He is someone with similar experience working under pressure with scores of patients in dire need of immediate help. Dr. King is a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital. He was at the Mass General operating room four years ago, he was treating victims of the Boston Marathon bombing. Thanks for coming in Dr. King., King: Of course. My pleasure., Howard: First let's stipulate that what happened in Boston and Las Vegas were different. Rescue crews could get to the victims in Boston right away, while that was not the case so much in Las Vegas. Plus the numbers last night, they were staggering: over 500 injured showing up in Las Vegas emergency rooms last night. So for a mass casualty event like this, tell us how hospitals even begin to cope with such a huge influx of victims., King: Well the coping with mass number of casualties starts long before patients get to the hospital. In the United States, we're not entirely sure how to affect the best response right now. For example, it's unclear if we should be providing medical care in the hot zone, that is, before the zone is absolutely cleared of all danger. Should we be providing medical care only in the green zone, so that is, evacuating patients from the hot zone to a zone we know is positively safe. Or is there some intermediate area — should we be providing care and triage in the so-called orange zone or the transitional zone., Every municipality deals with these scenarios differently. Nobody has the right answer yet probably because there isn't a right answer. But the care of the injured starts the moment the first responder lays eyes on and that care is continuous from that point of injury all the way to and including and past the hospital stay., Howard: And there's a lot of training, I'm sure, emergency training going into this at this point., King: Sadly, in the United States we have been forced to create plans and deal with these kinds of scenarios much too often. And that has resulted in an infrastructure that is prepared to deal with this., Howard: As we mentioned, you were in the operating room on the day of the Boston Marathon bombing back in 2013. In fact, you run the marathon, I understand., King: That's correct., Howard: And you rushed to the hospital to scrub in once news of the bombing broke. Were there lessons to be learned from that day?, King: Oh, there certainly were. There's always lessons to be learned from any mass casualty incident, and it's incumbent upon first responders — it's incumbent upon all of us to critically examine all of these events afterwards and try to determine, you know, what we absolutely did right, what we can do better, maybe some mistakes that we made and that kind of introspection is what makes responding to each of these subsequent events better than it was the last time. It's our responsibility, once the dust has settled, to look back and try to determine the best pathway forward for the next one. It's an unfortunate, sad reality that in the world we live in currently, there will likely be a next one., Howard: Well, aside from your work at Mass General, you also treated U.S. troops who've been wounded in battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. So you have military experience. How fair is it to ask civilian workers, nurses and doctors who've never been in the military setting to do this kind of work in the field?, King: Well, it depends where the work is being done. So the military lessons of war, medical military lessons of war, have absolutely been translated to almost every civilian trauma center in the United States., Howard: Are the workers psychologically prepared to put themselves without military training in these situations?, King: That is a very interesting question. That gets to what we call the so-called second victim. Compassionate caring providers who are asked to do something they've not done before, perhaps not even conceived of doing so without forethought, and you put them in this kind of dynamic extremely stressful environment, and they may perform admirably throughout the acute event, but the decompression afterwards can be very problematic. And all the medical personnel and allied medical personnel need to be aware that they can suffer effects., Howard: Like post-traumatic stress?, King: Post-traumatic stress, stress in general, adjustment disorders. And we identify that as the so-called second victim, because these people who are giving every ounce of themselves to the care of the injured right now, that may not be for free for them., Howard: OK. Thank you so much for joining us Dr. King., King: My pleasure., Howard: That's Dr. David King of Massachusetts General Hospital., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

We can use the world as a mirror for capital punishment, for weapons, and how we think about guns and our relationship to them, but we are our own country. We’ve got to make our own decisions.”, Sennott said he can sense restlessness among American citizens who have repeatedly called for an assault weapons ban after other mass shootings, including in Newtown, Connecticut and Orlando, Florida., “How many times do we have to have a president, in this case, tweet, ‘Thoughts and prayers are with you’? I can sense that there’s real frustration with that,” he said. “Thoughts and prayers — What about action?

444,[Should state change compensation law for wrongfully convicted?],"[ Public defenders, advocates and former inmates whose convictions were overturned are meeting at the Massachusetts statehouse on Monday to call for changes to a state law that provides compensation to the wrongfully convicted. , They say the law takes too long to help released inmates and sets an unreasonable bar to acquire compensation, forcing many to settle rather than fight a costly legal battle. The effort comes nine months after 
a story by The New England Center for Investigative Reporting revealed problems with the 2004 law, prompting new legislation to fix it. , Massachusetts is one of 37 states with laws that compensate the wrongly convicted, but of the 67 people who have filed for compensation, less than half have so far have received any money. The average payout is $364,228, 
according to state data recently obtained by The New England Center for Investigative Reporting. 
,  Some are still awaiting a decision three or four years after first filing for help, records show. ,  “It’s just delay and delay and delay,’’ said Boston lawyer Michael Kendall, who says too often the state’s Attorney General’s office fights cases that have already been long litigated in court. The state will “either knock down the amount or perhaps wear them out and not have to pay at all. It’s been truly frustrating.” ,  One of his Kendall’s clients, Kevin O’Loughlin, has been waiting more than two years to get compensation. His conviction for raping an 11-year-old girl was vacated in 2015 by a superior court judge in Middlesex County. ,  O’Loughlin, who was charged with the rape when he was 19, spent nearly four years in prison and say he was a target for violent assaults from other inmates. ,  The group will be meeting on what is known as international “
Wrongful Conviction Day,” where advocates also are calling for a new “
forensic commission” to prevent tainted evidence from distorting the legal process. ,  Just this summer, three men who each served decades in prison for murders have seen Massachusetts judges vacate their convictions or District Attorney’s offices decide not to re-prosecute their cases. ,  Victor Rosario, a 60-year-old Boston resident, spent 32 years in prison, wrongly convicted of setting a fire in Lowell that killed eight people.  His legal battle to win freedom and vindication took him to the state’s highest court. Earlier this year, Supreme Court Justice Kimberly Budd described Rosario’s conviction as a “substantial miscarriage of justice.” ,  Rosario, who now works as an outreach pastor at the Tremont Temple Baptist Church in Boston, plans to seek compensation from the state. ,  “There’s no way I can get those years back,” said Rosario, sitting in his church office with his wife, Beverly Rosario. “What happened that I didn’t have the opportunity to become somebody? My whole entire dreams, where they went?” ,  Doing the math to calculate what all those lost years are worth can be depressing. ,  Even if Rosario were awarded the maximum allowed in Massachusetts, it would amount to just $15,625 a year for each year he was jailed. ,  In neighboring Connecticut, the payout for people like Rosario averages more than ten times that – $183,000 for each year imprisoned, according to a recent study conducted by Jeffrey Gutman, a professor at The George Washington University Law School. ,  Nationwide, compensation for the wrongly convicted averages just under $24,000 for each year of incarceration, Gutman’s study found. ,  In Massachusetts, the lawmaker who wrote the compensation law in 2004 now wants to change it. State Sen. Patricia Jehlen, a Democrat from Somerville, wants to remove the $500,000 cap on total compensation and lower the legal burden for getting that money. 
, , Jehlen’s bill would potentially lower the legal bar for people such as Rosario, meaning that evidence “consistent with innocence,” such as flawed witness testimonies, would more easily open the door to eligibility for compensation.,  , “There’s an issue of justice, if you take people’s liberty for long periods of time, the state owes them a moral debt,” she said.  “They owe them a financial debt, too.” , Jehlen understands that lifting the cap on money could trigger pushback from fiscal hawks. , “It’s tough, we’re very constrained with budgets. But we didn’t have any problem paying to keep them locked up all that time,” she said. , An initial hearing on Jehlen’s bill in June drew no critics, but the legislation has to clear both the Ways and Means and Judiciary committees. , Most states that limit payouts use a formula based on the number of years a person was imprisoned, Gutman said. , “The strange thing about Massachusetts has been that, in effect, the longer that you’re incarcerated the less you get per year,” Gutman said. , Settlements negotiated with Attorney General Maura Healy’s office earlier this year offer a clear example. Charles Wilhite of Springfield spent just over three years in prison on a murder conviction and was acquitted after getting a second trial. He received $400,000 from the state. , Angel Echavarria, a former Lynn resident, received a $450,000 settlement but was locked up for seven times as many years. , Emily Snyder, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Maura Healey, said staff attorneys believe relief for the wrongly convicted is very important, but they must abide by the limits of the law. Healy’s office is open to changes to make the process more efficient for the wrongly convicted. , Critics of the law also say that the long path to getting any compensation deprives recently exonerated people of help they desperately need. , Lisa Kavanaugh, a public defender who directs the New England Innocence Program, said people are not only deprived of liberty, but their lives are completely upended. , Kavanaugh backs Jehlen’s legislative reform, which also includes a plan to offer immediate cash assistance, free tuition at state colleges and other social services to people who lost years of their lives to a wrongful conviction. , “One of the worst things that happens to people who are sent to prison is that the ties to the family and community are often irreparably broken,” she said. “When you walk out of prison, you don’t have that kind of support. You are alone in a more profound way than anyone can imagine.”]"
445,[How Grazing Fields Farm Changed How We Build Highways],"[There’s a big bend in the road as you travel to and from Cape Cod along Route 25 near the Bourne Bridge, and it’s a curve that marks a historic turning point in how we think about building highways., In the late 1950s, highway engineers were planning an extension of the interstate highway system that would connect I-195 to the Bourne Bridge, relieving the Cape-bound traffic that was congesting the main streets of Wareham and Buzzards Bay. They were planning to build what became known as Route 25 right through the middle of Hope Ingersoll's 900-acre Grazing Fields Farm., Ingersoll tried to convince highway officials to build along the northern border of her farm and preserve the middle, but they ignored her plans, which she had drawn up by a highway engineer and paid for herself. She maintained that her plan would be better for the environment, preventing harmful runoff from polluting nearby cranberry bogs and the town of Bourne's water supply., Finally, she was vindicated in 1982 when the courts ruled in her favor. A judge found that highway officials were violating newly adopted laws to protect the environment by not even considering Hope's pan. It was the first case where a private citizen, acting alone, stopped a major state and federal highway project in New England. It also put bureaucrats on notice that public opinion could have such a powerful impact on government planning, especially when it came to the environment.  , , The realignment of Route 25 also protects what was an arts colony started 100 years ago by Hope's mother — Mary Tudor Garland. One of the frequent visitors was Kahlil Gibran, who wrote portions of his famous book ""The Prophet"" in a prefab cottage there. These days, Hope Ingersoll's grandson Kofi Ingersoll (pictured above with his father Gerry) runs a large organic farm which he named Bay End Farm after the original farm his great-grandmother began in 1906. It was his grandmother Hope who renamed the farm Grazing Fields. , To listen to Bob Seay's story about Grazing Fields Farm, click on the audio player above., Bob Seay is the transportation reporter for WGBH News. ]"
446,[LISTEN: Lawyers' Committee Claims ICE Raids In Massachusetts Are Retaliatory ],"[Barbara Howard:  Fifty people were arrested on federal immigration charges in Massachusetts during a four day Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation that ended earlier this week. The majority of those taken into custody did have criminal records according to ICE, though many did not. And now a local group, the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, is filing a Freedom of Information Act or FOIA request with the federal government to learn about the basis for and the scope of those arrests. With us on the line is the group's executive director, Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal. Thanks for joining us., Espinoza-Madrigal: Thank you, Barbara., Howard: Well, so, those local arrests they were part of a larger nationwide operation, isn't that right?, Espinoza-Madrigal: That is correct. Massachusetts was targeted along with a number of other jurisdictions., Howard: Where were most of these arrests? Were they in the state's so-called sanctuary cities or elsewhere or both?, Espinoza-Madrigal: The arrests happened in jurisdictions across the state. Sanctuary cities were targeted. But so were other towns that have not really weighed in on these immigration issues at all., Howard: Now, your group is making the claim though that ICE made these arrests in Massachusetts, in the state here, in retaliation for a ruling from the state's highest court that local and state police cannot hold onto suspects based only on pending immigration violations. But what kind of evidence can you offer to back up that claim?, Espinoza-Madrigal: The fact that Massachusetts came out with such a strong ruling placed us in the bull's eye for federal immigration enforcement. When the federal government released the list of places that it had targeted, it mostly concentrated efforts in cities like Los Angeles or Philadelphia, but it's also included Massachusetts as a place of priority. The fact that we were roped in with other cities that have been the target of the federal government. So, we were specifically targeted because of our immigrant friendly policies. No other state was on the list of enforcement activity., Howard: Now you've put in a FOIA request to get information from the federal government about these raids. What kind of things are you trying to find out with a FOIA request?, Espinoza-Madrigal: We submitted the FOIA request to determine whether communications between immigration officials reference the Massachusetts Supreme Court decision that was very immigrant friendly. If public records released show references to the Supreme Court decision, it could be strong evidence that we are being retaliated for following the rule of law., Howard: If you find that that is in fact the case, what can be done about it?, Espinoza-Madrigal: There is precedent for other cities that have sued the federal government or in worst thing immigration policies in a retaliatory fashion. Most recently, in New Haven, Connecticut when the city decided to issue a municipal identification card to people regardless of immigration status, federal officials raided New Haven. Public records request in connection with the New Haven raid showed strong evidence that the city had been selected because it had opted to implement the municipal ID. In Massachusetts, if we find similar evidence of retaliation, it can be the basis of a lawsuit against the federal government for abuse of power and politicizing the immigration apparatus., Howard: OK. Thanks for joining us, Mr. Espinoza-Madrigal., Espinoza-Madrigal: Thank you., Howard: That's Ivan Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice. WGBH News did reach out to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. An ICE spokesman offered no comment on the Lawyers Committee's FOIA request but replied with an earlier statement on the arrests, saying that the operation that the agency called Operation Safe City “focused on cities and regions where ICE deportation officers are denied access to jails and prisons to interview suspected immigration violators, or jurisdictions where ICE detainers are not honored. “,  , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

450,"[As Boston Dreams Of Amazon, Suffolk Downs Braces For The End]","[There's an eerie feeling at Suffolk Downs these days. The mile-long track is still immaculately manicured. The grandstand seats still gleam. And from Wednesday to Sunday, patrons still place bets on races happening elsewhere. But the whole place is permeated by the knowledge that the end is near., ""Beyond 2018, this is going be a major mixed-use development,"" said Chip Tuttle, Suffolk Downs' COO., For years, Tuttle hoped to save the 80-year-old track by adding a new casino. But when the state awarded the Boston-area's lone casino license to Steve Wynn's Everett project in 2014, instead of a competing proposal located at Suffolk Downs, Tuttle reconciled himself to the inevitable., Today, he blames the same industry he once tried to partner with., ""Over the last 20 years, casino gambling has gone from two states, Nevada and New Jersey, to 39 or 40,"" Tuttle said. ""Horse racing still does really, really well on the big days, the big weekends ... Where it really is suffering is as a day-to-day gambling product. On Wednesday or Thursday, during the week, it’s just got greater competition."", Suffolk Downs did add two extra racing days this weekend — for a total of eight this year — after the Massachusetts Gaming Commission shared some surplus cash from the state’s Race Horse Development Fund. Still, in the long run, Tuttle's new best-case scenario is a standalone simulcast betting parlor located somewhere near the current track. , ""We need some changes in the current simulcasting and racing laws to do that,"" Tuttle said. ""A simulcast facility in what would be more like a modern sports bar, but set up for horse racing specifically."", Meanwhile, the land where Suffolk Downs currently sits might be the hottest development spot in Massachusetts. The HYM Investment Group — known for projects like Brighton’s Boston Landing — bought the parcel for a reported $155 million earlier this year., David Begelfer, the head of NAIOP Massachusetts: The Commercial Real Estate Development Association, says it was an excellent investment., ""Suffolk Downs is a phenomenal development opportunity,"" he said. ""It’s going to be a mixed-use development. It’s going to have housing, it’s going to have retail, it’s going to have office, it’ll probably have lab [space]. It’ll have all these things that are going to be built out over the next 10 years, plus. [And] it has mass transit ... It’s an ideal site."", Now, of course, there's fevered speculation that Amazon might select Boston for its second national headquarters — and build a new 50,000 person campus right where Suffolk Downs currently sits., , HYM declined WGBH News' request for an interview. But this week, during a Revere City Council hearing, HYM head Thomas O'Brien urged the city not to count on Amazon., ""No promises on that, by the way,"" O'Brien said. ""The way we think of this, it’s kind of plan A and plan 1A. So we’re swinging for the fences, but we have a great plan, whatever happens."", O'Brien also said whatever Amazon decides, HYM will develop the site quickly. Begelfer thinks they’ll craft two plans simultaneously —one featuring Amazon, and one without. , ""You go forward on the basis that you’re not going to have Amazon there, but you obviously try to attract Amazon to it,"" he said. ""If you get the gold ring, I think you’ll be able to accommodate yourself."", But Begelfer adds a note of caution. While landing Amazon would be a coup, he says, its arrival would create a ripple effect that could seriously stress the Boston area's housing market and workforce., ""You’re going to have a lot of other companies that want to be near the mother ship, if you will,"" Befelger said. ""It’s not just 50,000 jobs, we're talking about a lot more. If we don’t plan in advance for, over the next 10 to 15 years, to change how we produce housing that could be much more affordable, how we could have skilled workers retrained, or trained in the first place, we’re going to have a serious problem."", For now, though, Amazon’s local impact is totally hypothetical.

451,[Where Does Boston Hand Out The Most Parking Tickets?],"[Barbara Howard: Parking tickets — we've all gotten one, and some of us have gotten, let's say, more than one. The Boston Business Journal has come out with a report showing where Boston parking tickets are handed out most frequently. Joining us now is the Boston Business Journal's David Harris, who has been looking into this. Thanks for being with us, David., David Harris: Thanks for having me., Howard: So you looked at parking ticket data in Boston over a one-year period — that was from July 1 of last year to June 30 of this year. Where are the hot spots in the city?, Harris: Well they're kind of typical places that you'd probably think of — Back Bay, so a big shopping area, in addition to Fenway and near BU. , Howard: Well so what kind of violations were you looking at?, Harris: So we looked at the biggest revenue generators by different violations. So there's 36 different violations, and the biggest one, by far, was resident-only parking spaces, and you can imagine a lot of people come into town and they don't have a resident parking sticker and they just find a good spot. And unfortunately, for them, they wind up with the ticket. And then the second biggest revenue generator was unpaid meter fees. They both brought in about $5.6 million dollars into the city's coffers., Howard: Well let me look at that resident parking that you're talking about. I'm looking at the map — Financial District, Fenway Park - that doesn't surprise me at all seeing the big spots on the map showing that those are big places that generate revenue for resident parking. Now, the unpaid meters — that seems to be mostly, what, around Back Bay? South End? Is that all the shopping that's going on there?, Harris: They varied, but definitely people coming into town probably not paying their meters or just neglecting to look at the signs at the meters. So definitely around that area, and then around 136 Harrison Ave., which is around Tufts Medical near Chinatown. There were a lot of people parking at resident parking-only spaces around there., Howard: So how much money did the City of Boston make in giving out all these parking tickets?, Harris: Well, for the last fiscal year, which is the same time period that we talked about, the city generated about $61 million in revenue, which is actually up from about three years ago when the city made about $57 million dollars in revenue from parking violations., Howard: One of the things that really caught my eye was a big red dot, and its code says that it's for double parking. Can you guess where that is?, Harris: I would guess North End., Howard: You got it. That's right. Anyone who's gone to eat, going down Hanover Street looking for a parking spot, there they are, all those double parked cars. So ... there’s some things that aren't too surprising.

The diet pills, the ones that would have caffeine or green tea, ... anytime I was taking it I could tell the difference in my heart.”, Doctors at the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) have studied the effects of diet pills and supplements and say they are linked to heart disease, stroke and liver failure. They also say that the risks are higher for young people, because they tend to experiment with different kinds of pills., Dr. Elisabeth Poorman of the CHA says studies have even found illegal drugs and banned substances in some diet pills,, “Unlike medications that you have to prove ... are safe and effective before being put onto the market,"" she said, ""dietary supplements ... are assumed to be safe, and in some cases they even contained completely banned substances like crystal methamphetamine.”, Poorman continued, “A lot of weight-loss supplements include a drug called sibutramine, which has in the past been used for weight loss but was very quickly pulled from the market because it is associated with heart attacks and strokes.”, McMillan says she started feeling ill during college., “I started, probably in college, having abnormal heart tests and some heart palpitations, but the minute I stopped using the pills and started eating and gained a little bit more weight, everything went back to normal, and so in my mind I was invincible.”  , Because diet pills and supplements are not regulated, the ingredients are often a mystery, State Representative Kay Khan has introduced a bill that would put diet pills and muscle-building supplements behind the counter and off-limits to anyone under 18., There is national opposition to the bill. The Natural Products Association issued a statement that said in part:, “This proposal would place onerous restrictions, most notably on small businesses. Dietary supplements are simply natural ingredients found in foods, and restricting access to them is unfair to Massachusetts consumers, hurts responsible retailers and drains the state budget through lost sales taxes. Nobody wins.” , The National Products Association’s president will be in Boston when lawmakers hear the bill on October 17., McMillan believes what lawmakers are proposing would have helped her. After years of treatment, she is finally free from her pill addiction and eating disorder, but the damage was done., “My husband and I got pregnant  ... and I miscarried,"" she said. ""My heart was not strong enough to carry a pregnancy, and we were advised against getting pregnant again, so we can’t have children because of the eating disorder, the diet pills, all that.”, McMillan and her husband adopted a daughter. She says if her daughter ever wants to know about diet pills, she will tell her to think about her health., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"
458,[State Renames Jamaica Way Bridge To Honor Arredondo Brothers And Raise Suicide Awareness],"[Carlos Arredondo found himself in the spotlight for his quick action in the hectic moments following the Boston Marathon Bombings., The iconic photo of Arredondo wheeling Jeff Bauman towards first responders emerged as a symbol of resilience and unity in the face of chaotic trauma. But that day, which will live on in infamy for Bostonians, was not the first time Arredondo dealt firsthand with tragedy. He and his former wife Victoria Foley lost their oldest son, Marine Lance Corporal Alexander, when he was killed in Najaf, Iraq in 2004 during Operation Iraqi Freedom., His son’s death galvanized Arredondo to become a vocal anti-war activist. But the fallout of Alex’s death deeply impacted his younger son Brian. Brian descended into depression and drug use, eventually taking his own life in 2011. , The crisis of depression and suicide among veterans is becoming more public, but Gold Star families across America also deal with the emotional trauma of losing their loved ones. This led Arredondo to establish the Arredondo Family Foundation — an organization dedicated to raising awareness about military-related suicides and providing suicide prevention training. The foundation also gives emergency relief to military families dealing with the suicide of a loved one and grants scholarships to siblings of deceased veterans.  , And now the state is honoring Arredondo's two sons by renaming the Jamaica Way Bridge by Huntington Avenue in their honor., Arredondo's foundation contacted State Representative Jeffrey Sanchez, who drafted the legislation, which was signed by Governor Charlie Baker in January. The ceremony will take place today as part of Suicide Awareness Month., Arredondo came into WGBH’s studio to talk with Morning Edition’s Joe Mathieu about the importance of supporting Gold Star families and what the renaming of the bridge means for raising awareness., , “This bridge means so many things to so many and sends a message to many. It’s unbelievable. It’s just a name on the bridge but the message behind that is very big,” Arredondo said., Arredondo said it’s pivotal to educate the public on how to identify warning signs of depression among veterans as well their immediate family members. And his organization has already begun the process. Yesterday they held a training session with the Brookline Fire Department about deescalation tactics whenever they respond to a distress call.,  Arredondo says the more people trained to identify the warning signs, the more likely a person's life can be saved., “My son paid the sacrifice … so with these issues we need to get more people involved in civic support [for veterans]”,  The ceremony takes place at 11 o'clock at the corner of River Road and Huntington Avenue. Governor Baker and Rep. Sanchez will join the choir from Sacred Heart School for the ceremony.]"
459,[Longfellow Bridge Work To Interrupt Red Line Service for 10 Weekends],"[Weekend travel from Cambridge to Boston is about to get harder for a few months, as a complicated construction project will shut down weekend T service over the Longfellow Bridge., For now, the Red Line is still rumbling over the Longfellow Bridge. But it’s coming to a stop here this weekend, and for nine more upcoming weekends. , “What you're looking at is some of the old infrastructure,"" said John McInerney of the state Department of Transportation as he lead a tour of the massive construction project on Wednesday. ""The arches there, the curved piece is what’s staying, the structural steel above it's all being replaced.”, It’s an early 1900s bridge, McInerney said, and it was time for an overhaul. “It was just due,"" he said. ""The inspection ratings and the engineers that review these bridges on a periodic basis — it was time. It's just a massive job. And it was time to get it reconstructed.”, , If it feels like the Longfellow has been under construction for a long time, that’s because it has., Work started in the spring of 2013. It’s not a simple job., “On a scale of complexity, I would say it's up there in the 8, 9 or 10 range,” McInerney said. That’s because they needed to keep the bridge open for all kinds of uses. “It's got vehicular traffic, train traffic, bike traffic, pedestrian traffic. And the phasing of the job has been very challenging over the course of the duration.”, And the historical nature of the bridge has made things more challenging. They restored its distinctive towers, with their salt and pepper shaker shape. And Chris Keough with the contractor on the job, White Skanska Consigli, said the historical commission told them they couldn’t use the bolts they normally would on a job like this. They had to use the same kind of rivets the bridge was originally built with., “In the old days it was essentially hot rivets that have a connection to make between two pieces of steel, and they'd have a heated rivet and they'd drive it through the opening, and then it would it would it would cool off,"" Keough said. ""And there you go. There’s your connection.” But nobody actually knew how to do that anymore, so they had to specially train workers for the job., , This weekend, they’ll do the work to move Red Line trains from temporary tracks they’ve been on to more permanent tracks., Todd Johnson of the MBTA says when they’re done, commutes should speed up a bit. , “Before the construction project, the speed over the bridge and continuing through the project has been 25 miles per hour,"" he said. ""When the construction project is completed we will be resuming the speed on the Red Line trains over the bridge back to its 40 mph speed, which we haven't seen in a few years.”, In the meantime, though, shuttle buses will be running from Kendall to Park Street on the weekends. After this one, there are nine more to go – not including the weekends of the Head of the Charles regatta and Thanksgiving. In the end, officials estimate the price tag for the federally funded project should come in under the original estimate of $303 million. And the Longfellow should be fully open for all traffic by next May., ,  , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

466,[Yvonne Spicer Emerges As Front-runner In Framingham's First Mayoral Race],"[The picture of who will lead Framingham through its transition from New England's largest town to one of its cities became a little clearer yesterday. In a preliminary election that drew more than a quarter of eligible voters, Yvonne Spicer and John Stefanini emerged as the two candidates who will compete to be the newly minted city's first mayor. Spicer, whose only political experience is as a town meeting member, surprised some analysts by earning half of the votes in a crowded field of seven candidates. She emerged as the front-runner over Stefanini, former town selectman and state representative who played a pivotal role in steering Framingham toward changing its system of government., While both candidates have similar platforms, many voters said Spicer's status as a newcomer to government was an appealing alternative to a man steeped in the political system. But Stefanini's political history is also an advantage — he has drawn in significant campaign donations., Both candidates said they plan to focus on revitalizing the downtown business district and focus on making Framingham more affordable to live in. , Regardless of who wins the election, people are paying attention. The town had a 27 percent voter turnout for the preliminary. WGBH New's Joe Mathieu spoke with reporter Tina Martin about the election. To get the full story, read the transcript below or click on the audio player above., Joe Mathieu: Lets go to Framingham, where voters were honking support for their candidates last evening in a historic race, the first ever vote for mayor in Framingham. The town voting to become a city earlier this year and joining us now in studio is a woman who was there for all of it last night, WGBH’s Tina Martin, who has basically been up all night. Tina, good morning., Tina Martin: Good morning to you, Joe., Joe Mathieu: This was a pretty big deal. As we mobilized in Framingham, incidentally, home to many listeners who hear us every day driving in, listening to WGBH’s Morning Edition. The city charter or should I say the town charter changed. Framingham goes from the biggest town in Massachusetts to the newest city., Tina Martin: To the newest city, correct., Joe Mathieu: And it’s time to pick a mayor. What happened last night?, Tina Martin: It is time to pick a mayor so we have two candidates out of the seven.  John Stefanini is a five-term state representative. He’s a two-term selectman. He’s an attorney. He grew up in Framingham, and he is going to be up against Yvonne Spicer, who is an African-American woman. She’s a vice president at the Museum of Science, and her political experience consists of being a town meeting member, and she has been a member of the fair housing committee. So, she’s not quite as politically experienced as John Stefanini, but what the two of them have in common is that they’re both very well-educated, and they’re both lifelong Framingham residents. The both told me they have a vision for the town now city. We have to get used to saying that. Let’s go to Yvonne Spicer., Audio of Yvonne Spicer: We have not been as good of shepherd’s as I think we’d like to with some of our open spaces. I also say economic development. Our downtown area has experienced some resurgence, but there’s still much more work to be done and part of that is looking at what kinds of jobs are available for our community, and I’m looking at trying to grow technical jobs that are higher-wage that allows people to work in Framingham, but also live in Framingham., Tina Martin: Work and live in Framingham. So that was a big theme last night, being able to work and live in the town. Let’s go to John Stefanini. I asked him his vision for the city., Audio of John Stefanini: I envision a community where every child has the same opportunity to achieve success. I envision a community where people proudly go to their neighborhood shopping plaza or downtown on a Saturday night for dinner or to shop. I envision a community where we preserve and protect our open spaces, and I envision a community where everyone has a voice at the table and can participate in the process., Tina Martin: So Joe, you heard Stefanini talk about every child having an opportunity. That was an underlying theme last night for voters also — school, education. There is a gentleman who we spoke to named Mike Lucek. Let’s listen to what he said., Joe Mathieu: This one of the voters you spoke with last night., Tina Martin: Yes., Audio of Mike Lucek, Framingham voter:  I’m looking for progress, especially with the school systems. I have a young son, and that’s primarily what I am looking at for candidates and councilors — so the quality of the education and trying to bring the Framingham school system up. I think I saw a Boston Magazine article where Framingham ranked 81st, but they’re in the top 20 in spending per student., Tina Martin: So that was the theme from voters last night. You know, the other thing, Joe, you talked about me being up all night. It wasn’t hard to be up all night because this is so exciting. Everybody was so, you know, kind of thrilled to feel like they had a seat at the table — that they’re driving this new administration. The assistant town clerk said that they had a 27 percent voter turnout.  , Joe Mathieu: Which is better than we saw in Boston, right?, Tina Martin: Much better than we saw in Boston. To put it in perspective, they usually don’t even break double digits for their general local election. So this is a huge deal., Joe Mathieu: You can speak to that. You live in Metro West, and you know what this means locally., Tina Martin: Absolutely, people are very, very excited about this, and I think that they really feel that they have an opportunity to see the kind of city that they’ve always wanted. And so that’s basically what we’re seeing., Joe Mathieu: Did you find that there was name recognition? These names are new to a lot of folks around Massachusetts, but in Framingham these are two known entities., Tina Martin: They’re two known entities. I think what I found very interesting was that Yvonne kind of was popular based on the fact that she is a newcomer. She’s grassroots. She doesn’t really have the political experience so maybe that leans to the fact that people are looking for something a little different. Maybe they want to try new things. Maybe they want to do things that are a little bit more nonconventional., Joe Mathieu: So, we’ve got our finalists, two finalists November 7th, the general election. I suspect you might be back in Framingham., Tina Martin: I suspect I will., Joe Mathieu: We’ll see how that goes. Thank you so much, WGBH Radio’s Tina Martin. I think you’re allowed to take a nap now., Tina Martin: You bet. , This post was updated to include the transcript.]"

While using some colorful language at a Friday rally, Trump decried NFL players who knelt during the national anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice.  Trump called the protests disrespectful to the country as well as to its military and encouraged fans to protest teams whose players participate in the protest. But that didn’t stop hundreds of players from either locking arms or kneeling during the start of their games Sunday.

The program provides a safe environment while moms with children work to become self-suffiicent. Deborah Hughes is the program's CEO., Hughes first walked by the Brookview House in Dorchester 27 years ago., “I watched the building being built and I live in the neighborhood, so everyday I would drive by wondering what was being built here,” she said., When she found out it was a place for families affected by homelessness, she says she went in, met the women who lived there at the time, and never left., Hughes, who has been part of the nonprofit world for years, started at Brookview House as a consultant and later became its CEO. The nonprofit has given thousands of women and children a roof over their heads through the years. With Hughes' encouragement, many have found permanent housing and never looked back. , Hughes has a philosophy: “What we say is, homelessness is your experience, it's not who you are,"" she said., But who Deborah Hughes is and why she does this runs in her blood., “My mother was the person in the neighborhood who took people in,"" Hughes said. , So when women — some fresh out of domestic violence situations or traumatic evictions — come to the door of Brookview, Hughes has only a few words., “For me, the first thing is 'Welcome.' Welcome to our home,"" Hughes said., Carmen Bones remembers those words coming from Hughes when she and her two children came to Brookview in 2015. Bones, like the other women in the 12 apartments, attends workshops and receives job training and help with resources to find permanent housing. Bones says Hughes helps her stay positive., “She’s a good person. She’s very kind,"" Bones said. ""I’m a strong woman and [I am] positive because I know one day I’m going to get something.”, Deborah Hughes says over the last eight years, Brookview House has seen a 93 percent increase in homelessness in Boston.

479,[BU Scientist: Football Is A Public Health Issue],"[Barbara Howard:  We've heard about brain injuries and NFL players, but what about the effects on casual players who once took to the football field? For Dr. Robert Stern, a researcher at Boston University’s Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center, the question is personal. He spoke with WGBH News telling how, as a proud father, he once enjoyed the camaraderie of the sidelines at Needham High School as he watched his own son play varsity football., Stern: That sons’ friends today, some of his closest friends are from those football days. I didn't know about this stuff then. He wouldn't have played. But no one really knew about this stuff then. This is all new. And, here's the problem. Everyone talks about concussions. It's concussion this, concussion that, and therefore, there can be concussion protocols that every high school, there can be baseline testing with these computer testing ahead of time. There's laws in every state in the country now for return to play, and that's great., But when it comes to the long term stuff, it's not concussions that are the issue. It's the repetitive hits, over and over and over again. If we focus on the bigger, more important issue, that the game has an inherent problem, the very nature of the way the game is played involves hitting heads over and over and over again, you can't take that out of the game. You can do something about concussions, and so it's in the NFL’s interest to focus on concussion because they can do something about it. They can count them. They can make changes to rules, and they can tell the world that they're doing something to protect players brain health. There can be new programs for learning how to tackle in youth football that are out there to help prevent concussion, but they’re still wearing those big helmets. You don't feel pain when you hit someone or when you fall on the ground., Howard: But your brain sloshes around., Stern: Your brain sloshes around every time …  I'm disturbed. I'm surprised that no matter what, the focus always keeps going back to concussions. And I'm hoping that parents and others can understand that when it comes to the long term consequences, concussions aren't the only issue., Howard: Do you see football as a public health issue?, Stern: I do. Well, it's a public health issue because of the numbers of people who may have long-term impairments due to playing. And those numbers, I'm afraid, of what they might be as we move forward. Here's something to contemplate: I've asked the question, has there ever been any activity that human beings have done that has included repetitive head impacts over and over again? The answer is no, not until very, very recently. That repetitive hit, that's something new. It really wasn't until the 1950’s that human beings started to hit their heads over and over again so repeatedly. And that was in two sports. One in boxing and the other football., American football has been played since the 1800s, but it wasn't until the mid 1950s that the large plastic helmets started to be used. And that changed the game. It did something that people don't think about a lot. It allowed them to just hit their heads without hurting, over and over again, Howard: Because the brain really doesn't have any nerve endings?, Stern: The brains don't have any nerve endings. And you have this big encasement so you're …, Howard: So you don't even realize that your brain is getting banged around., Stern: Of course not. And so when you think of it, people who played tackle football in high school or in college in this new era of big helmets, they're in their 70s now. And the folks who started playing tackle football as kids, the earliest, are only in their late 50s and early 60s now. So we may have not even seen anything yet. Because there's been millions and millions of people who’ve played tackle football in this new era since the 1950s and 60s who started playing as kids. And they're only getting to the age where a degenerative brain disease would start being manifest in large numbers., I certainly hope that I'm wrong, but that's a public health issue., Howard: Thanks so much for coming in., Stern: You're very welcome., Howard: That's Dr. Robert Stern of Boston University's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

481,[Pharmacist On Trial For Deadly Meningitis Outbreak],"[The jury selection and trial against Glenn Chin began this week. , Chin was the supervising pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center (NECC) five years ago, and now he’s facing charges of second-degree murder., It all goes back to the fall of 2012, when hundreds of people in 20 different states fell gravely ill from an infection that’s rarely seen: fungal meningitis., The outbreak was traced back to vials of contaminated medication made at the compounding pharmacy in Framingham where Chin worked. Investigators found mold in some of the pharmacy's supposedly sterile steroid injections., “Because those steroids were sent through the mail out of state, it became a federal crime,” said Daniel Medwed, WGBH News legal analyst and Northeastern University professor. “The two biggest fish in this enterprise were Barry Cadden and Glenn Chin.”, Barry Cadden was the co-owner and president of NECC and Glenn Chin was the supervising pharmacist., Prosecutors charged both with second-degree murder, mail fraud and racketeering. Both pleaded not-guilty, and both blamed each other for the outbreak., Cadden went on trial earlier this year. His defense team argued he wasn’t in the lab making decisions, and he acted as soon as he realized something was wrong. They played a voicemail he left for a clinic after he’d heard that there were problems with some medications: “We would like you to quarantine this product at this time and call us as soon as possible to discuss the situation,” Cadden can be heard saying. “We consider this an emergency.”, Prosecutors argued Cadden was greedy and he valued money over patient's lives. He instructed his employees to ignore cleaning procedures, use expired drug ingredients, and skirted industry regulations., Jurors saw Barry Cadden in a staff training video where he mentioned regulators disparagingly: “They don’t even know what they are looking at. They have no clue. They go around and they’re like: ‘Oh Barry’s place looks great. Hey, I got to go. Cup of coffee.’ And they go out the door. Really, that’s what it’s like,"" Cadden said. , Jurors agreed the behavior was criminal., “Barry Cadden was convicted of a number of crimes, including racketeering and mail fraud and conspiracy,” said Medwed. “He was ultimately sentenced to a little more than nine years in prison.”, However, even though the tainted products led to the deaths of more than 60 people, Cadden was acquitted of second-degree murder – and got a far shorter sentence than prosecutors had wanted. Medwed says that raises the stakes for Glenn Chin’s trial., “This is the last chance for federal prosecutors to hold somebody accountable for a homicide. So that could mean that prosecutors could be especially aggressive and assertive,"" he said., Medwed thinks the case against Chin may be less challenging for prosecutors than the case against Barry Cadden, who oversaw the business side of things., “Glen Chin might be in greater jeopardy of a conviction on one or more of those murder counts because of his close proximity to the production of the tainted pharmaceuticals,"" Medwed said., As the supervising pharmacist, Glenn Chin was in the labs where the medications were made. “Therefore, it will be easier for prosecutors to prove causation,” Medwed added. “His misconduct or his lack of oversight directly caused the fatal result.”, However, during opening statements, Chin’s lawyer argued that the second-degree murder charges are an overreach. They say there was no malice or intent to cause harm and, at worst, Chin is guilty of involuntary manslaughter., Chin’s defense team blamed Barry Cadden and said that Glenn Chin was an employee facing enormous pressure., Chin has been under house arrest since late 2014. He was stopped at Logan airport on his way to Hong Kong – he says he and his family were on a round-trip ticket to attend a wedding., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

The worst,” said medical ethicist Art Caplan. “[It’s] grossly unethical, because it basically is returning power to the states rather than having national standards.”, Caplan explained that when states, especially poor states, are left in charge of healthcare, they decline to cover things that aren’t mandated by federal requirements., “They don’t cover mental health or pregnancy care, contraception ... they just drop the coverage because they don’t have to follow any federal requirements,” said Caplan., He said this will result in fewer protections for vulnerable populations like children and those in nursing homes., “You’re getting a plan that basically says, ‘Let’s just give all the money in block grants to the states; let’s give more money to the states that didn’t work with Obamacare to expand Medicaid; let’s chop Medicaid back so that children, single head-of-households females, and those who are in nursing homes will have less money available to them, and let’s take out all the protections,'” he said. “It’s really a miserable, blockheaded plan.”, Medical Ethicist Art Caplan is Head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center ad the co-host of the Everyday Ethics podcast.

484,[Small Uptick In Child Deaths Due To Neglect],"[BARBARA HOWARD: Abuse and neglect still take the lives of children here in Massachusetts. For four years, Jenifer McKim a reporter with WGBH news partner the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, has been tracking the numbers. She recently got last year's data from the State Department of Children and Families — DCF. And Jenifer's here in the studio to walk us through those new numbers. Hi, Jenifer., JENIFER MCKIM: Hi there., HOWARD: So what does the data tell us?, MCKIM: So the numbers have been worse in other years. This year, 13 children died of deaths linked to abuse and neglect, four of whom were in open cases with DCF. But those numbers are actually better than other years. In 2013, 39 children died — 16 of whom were under the watch of the State Department of Children and Families., HOWARD: So tell me some of their stories. What do the stories tell us?, MCKIM: There are still tragic stories of children whose cases have been missed, who could have likely been saved. One of whom was a boy named Kenai Whyte, [a] 3-year-old from Roxbury who died at the hands allegedly of his stepmother, and he had been in the system for years before he died. There were several cases of children who died of sudden unexpected infant death with unsafe sleep — children who were co-sleeping with their parents, etc. Several of those were also with DCF, and that has been often linked to substance abuse., HOWARD: Substance abuse among the parents?, MCKIM: Exactly. The majority of the kids were not under the state watch. So those are cases we're not sure whether we could have done more or less because the state really keeps a lot of information from us, like they don't tell us if people had called to say the child was at risk, but they did not open a case. So we don't know, in many cases, whether they knew or not whether this child was troubled beforehand., HOWARD: So some of these cases where they die in their sleep, it's chalked up to what — to SIDS, sudden infant death syndrome?, MCKIM: Well these ones are considered unsafe sleep, and that's why they're in the category of abuse and neglect, because these children were either put to sleep on their bellies or sleeping with their parents. And so there's a lot of controversy about the unsafe sleep deaths. But these are ones that the state considered there [were] some problems with the way the parents treated them., HOWARD: Maybe not abuse but at least neglect?, MCKIM: Neglect., HOWARD: Well you said that last year's deaths while up from the year before are down overall over the course of several years. Why do you think the numbers have dropped?, MCKIM: The numbers were really high in 2013 — just about the time when there [were] some high profile deaths — you had Jeremiah Oliver, the 5 year old Fitchburg boy who disappeared and then was found later on the side of the road. You had that awful story of Bella Bond, who was found in a trash bag in the Harbor. So these cases created a lot of scrutiny on child deaths in Massachusetts, and we at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting focused on a lot of the cases that hadn't been high profile. There [were] 110 kids between 2009 and 2013 who died of abuse and neglect, a third of them under the watch of the state. So Gov. Charlie Baker spoke publicly about wanting to make it safer for troubled kids, and they really made changes in the department, including reducing caseload, adding budget and changing the way they assess risk., HOWARD: Now I've often heard about a pendulum swings in child welfare where the states — they lurch from not really protecting children enough with some terrible outcomes that make headlines, and then pulling too many kids out in response, pulling them out of homes that might have been salvageable. What's happening here?, MCKIM: Yeah, exactly. So, during this period when there is a high scrutiny and a lot of concern about kids, there was an increase in the number of calls going to DCF saying ""these kids are at risk."" The social workers opened more cases and they pulled more children away from their homes. Some people say that's the best thing to do and they're concerned, however, that now there's a foster care crisis and there's not enough places to house children. Other people say not that many children should be pulled from their homes at all., HOWARD: And you're saying that some social workers and defense attorneys for the kids are finding problems with that, just finding places to put them?, MCKIM: There's a term now called ""lobby kids"" — children who are pulled away from their homes and there's nowhere to put them and they end up spending hours at the DCF lobby while they're waiting to find a new home for them., HOWARD: So ""lobby kids"" — it's become an actual term?, MCKIM: It is. I've heard stories of social workers carrying bassinets to their desks and making calls trying to find a home for these children. And also just having these kids waiting in lobbies, waiting for them to find a place to put them maybe just for one night and then put them somewhere else the next day., HOWARD: So tough on the kids. Thanks for coming in, Jenifer., MCKIM: Thank you very much., HOWARD: That's Jenifer McKim of WGBH News partner the New England Center for Investigative Reporting., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
485,[Mass. Cultural Council Against Sale Of Art By Berkshire Museum],"[HENRY SANTORO: The Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield is looking to raise millions of dollars for improvements through the auction of some of its art. The sale of 40 pieces from its collection, scheduled for this November, is raising the ire of many, now including the Massachusetts Cultural Council – the state's chief arts agency. Joining us from our sister station in Springfield, WGBY, is Carrie Saldo who broke the story of the sale. Carrie, thanks so much for coming on., CARRIE SALDO: Absolutely, great to be here., SANTORO: So it was announced that the Mass Cultural Council wants the Berkshire Museum to scrap this auction, get rid of it. Why?, SALDO: Largely because the Cultural Council said, contrary to what Berkshire museum leadership has said, it doesn't need the money to stabilize its finances. And Greg Liakos, the Cultural Council spokesman, who I spoke with, said that instead, the museum could launch new exhibits or fundraisers among some other ideas. Now in July, museum leadership announced a $60 million plan largely contingent on the sale of these artworks, and that's meant to boost its endowment and renovate the 114-year-old museum so that it can better appeal to 21st century audiences. Without the money, the Berkshire Museum leadership has said that they'll close within eight years, and Cultural Council has said that the planned sale violates the public trust because in exchange for being a nonprofit that receives tax breaks, museums are supposed to care for the art collections that it has on behalf of the public, and Berkshire Museum has said it's being a good steward by taking care to secure its financial future., SANTORO: Now when you broke this story, reactions against this auction were very negative. Why do you think so?, SALDO: Part of that stems from the fact that professional museums' ethics guidelines state that there are two reasons for the sale of artwork, and the money from those proceeds are meant to either purchase additional artworks or to care for their existing collections. It's not unusual for museums to sell artwork, but again, it's the idea that the Berkshire Museum intends to use the money from this planned sale for renovation and to boost its endowment. That's what's made it controversial. And some say the museum is essentially trading artwork for cash, which runs counter to those ethics guidelines that I mentioned., SANTORO: Who else is on board as opposing the auction?, SALDO: Well the American Alliance of Museums is among the professional museum organizations that have asked Berkshire Museum to pause its planned sale and explore other options, as have members of the public. And the controversy has also drawn the attention of Attorney General Maura Healey, whose office is reviewing the matter. And Anita Walker of the Cultural Council is expected to meet with the head of the nonprofit's charities division of the AG's office to discuss the findings that the Cultural Council arrived at., SANTORO: Do the museum's directors feel like they're being ganged up on here?, SALDO: Well the museum leadership has said that they did an exhaustive series of research to arrive at this very difficult decision to sell the 40 works of art – more than two years of study, you know, they spoke with members of the community. So while they have said that it was a very difficult decision to reach, they feel like they really did their due diligence here and that this is the best way to secure their finances and assure that they remain open for years to come., SANTORO Has the museum received any public support for the sale?, SALDO: I would say the most prominent public support they've received is from Joseph Thompson who is the director of Mass MoCA in North Adams, which is the largest contemporary art museum in the country, and he's among those who've said that they support Berkshire Museum’s decision., SANTORO: So what are the next steps that this museum – the Berkshire Museum – has to take?, SALDO: So the Cultural Council and Berkshire Museum leadership – they’re set to meet in October to review some other additional questions that the Cultural Council has about Berkshire Museum’s finances. Meanwhile, [the] Museum’s Board of Trustees has said that the decision to sell the artwork was, as I said, a difficult one to reach, but necessary for it to survive. And it has said that it plans to move forward with the sale., SANTORO OK Carrie, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon., SALDO: You're welcome., SANTORO: That's Carrie Saldo from our sister station WGBY in Springfield.

495,[How The Former Voice Of The Boston Red Sox Broke Down Barriers],"[The unfurling of a banner from the stands of Fenway Park last week proclaiming “Racism is as American as baseball” have reminded the country of the Red Sox's long history with race. The event also serves to shine a light on the progress made by the team, including an historic first., It was crisp and cool for the first game of the 1996 season at Fenway Park, as the Red Sox prepared to take on the Minnesota Twins., Public address announcer Leslie Sterling's voice rang through the speakers: “Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Fenway Park."", Sterling had been on the job for two years, having replaced the late and legendary Sherm Feller, who passed away after 27 seasons as the voice of the Boston Red Sox. His familiar guttural intonation was a hard act to follow,, “Because of Sherm, we still kept the 'ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,'” remembered Sterling. ""We couldn’t get rid of that, because his signature became a signature of Fenway Park.” , Indeed, it was in keeping with long-established Fenway tradition. Sterling’s hiring was not. She was the first female, and the first African American, public address announcer in Red Sox history. , , Some fans — even two years on — still were not used to hearing Sterling’s mezzo-soprano voice over the PA system. , A 1979 Harvard graduate, Sterling was a singer, a devoted baseball fan, and a freelance sports reporter. After a stint as an executive assistant at Harvard Business School, she — along with more than 100 others — applied for the position of public address announcer for the Red Sox. Sterling got the job, , “I personally felt my skin color was less of an issue than my gender,"" she said. ""Major League Baseball was undergoing changes about women being involved in sportscasting, so that was much more of an issue, I think, than race for me at that time.”, Indeed, there was only one other female baseball announcer at the time. But public attention was also focused on Sterling’s skin color, especially in the context of the Red Sox historically — the last major league team to integrate. , “I know that other people had bad experiences at Fenway in terms of feeling uncomfortable,"" said Sterling. ""Not very many black people in the stands, people had uncomfortable feelings about the Red Sox's racial past.”, But Sterling said she tried to set that aside, “because when, you know, you’re a pioneer, you’re trying to set a positive example for people,"" she said.  ""So, yeah, I had some things I had to go through that I never shared with anyone. But I did not let that get in my way of enjoying the ball park and enjoying the game.”, But 1996 would be Leslie Sterling’s last year as the Red Sox public address announcer. Some Red Sox insiders told WGBH that she did not catch on with significant numbers of fans. Others chalked that analysis up to sexism. Sterling says she was simply ready to move on. She entered Harvard’s Divinity School shortly afterward, and today she serves as rector at St. Bartholomew’s Episcopal Church in Cambridge. , Sterling says in many ways her brief stint as Red Sox public address announcer prepared her for the pulpit., “I was already discerning my call at the time, so it was already in the back of my mind,"" she said. ""And I used to pray before the game that everyone within the sound of my voice ... would receive some of the some of the spirit, and some of the energy, and some of the vitality that I was trying to put forward.”, Sterling told WGBH that she rarely visits Fenway Park.  Yet, she said, she remains a fan, watching and listening to games, even while acknowledging the Red Sox’s complicated racial history – and remembering when she helped move that history forward with ten simple words:, “Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to Fenway Park."", Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

499,[New Study Links Playing Football At A Young Age To Behavioral Problems ],"[BARBARA HOWARD: Well we've heard about concussions and NFL players, but what about children who play tackle football? A new study out today from Boston University's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center links kids under age 12 who play tackle football with mood and behavior problems later in life. In the studio to talk about these findings is Dr. Robert Stern, who helped lead that study. Thanks for being here, Dr. Stern., STERN: Thanks for having me., HOWARD: So who did you look at for this study?, STERN: We looked at a little over 200 former football players. They were people who only played up through high school, some people who only played up through college, and then some people who played all the way through the pros. They were all in adulthood, average age was 51., HOWARD: And what did you find?, STERN: Well what we found was that folks who started playing tackle football before the age of 12, compared to the ones who started at 12 or older, had three times the odds of having depression as adults and two times the odds of having problems with behavioral regulation, being kind of out of control, and problems with apathy., HOWARD: Is there a safe sport for people to enroll their children in?, STERN: Oh, sure. You know, kids need to participate in sports. And boy, do they need to exercise. With tackle football, playing the game involves hundreds of hits to the head every season. It's inherent in the game. Each one of those hits, the brain is moving rapidly inside that hard skull and the helmet doesn't stop that. We're not looking at concussions. If you think of two little kids at the line of scrimmage — as soon as that ball is snapped, they go head to head, and those hits can be meaningful., HOWARD: Even if they're not concussions?, STERN: Even if they're not concussions. A good example is a research study that came out of Wake Forest University last year. What they did was, they studied youth football — kids ages, I think, 8 to 13 — and they put accelerometer gizmos inside the helmets so they could measure the frequency, severity, types of hits that the kids got to their heads. What they did was, they conducted MRI scans before and after the season on each kid. There were, as I think, a handful of kids who had concussions that were diagnosed, and those kids were not part of the study. They only included the kids who didn't have concussions, and what they found was striking., After just one season, there was this really strong relationship between the total amount of exposure to these subconcussive hits and actual changes to the structural integrity of the brain. In other words, it wasn't the big hits — it was the total exposure to these smaller, repetitive hits that resulted in changes to the structure of the brain just after one season. The more hits people get, it seems that there's the greater risk for developing long-term problems., HOWARD: Like what?, STERN: Like cognitive impairment, like memory impairment, like significant depression, like problems with being able to live independently, like perhaps getting CTE, and eventually the dementia from CTE., HOWARD: Well, CTE — chronic traumatic encephalopathy — it's been plaguing football players. It's really only diagnosable after death upon examination of a brain. So when do symptoms of CTE come up — much later in life?, STERN: I mean, you know, like other neuro-degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, the disease starts years or decades before the symptoms ever begin. We have people who have been diagnosed with CTE who were fine until their 50s or 60s. And then, all of a sudden, they start showing what otherwise would be viewed as Alzheimer’s disease, the types of changes of Alzheimer's disease. But that's not what they have., HOWARD: The focus of the study that you helped lead that's out today is children who started playing football under the age of 12. Is there any advantage to waiting until you're over 12 to play, or is it ever safe?, STERN: I don't think I can comfortably say it's safe at any time — that's not what this study shows. It's not that waiting till 13 makes it safer. Overall, this study suggests that if you can put it off, then maybe you have less risk for problems later in life., HOWARD: But under 12 is not a good idea., STERN: I don't think so., HOWARD: You had a son who played — would you let him do it again?, STERN: Absolutely not., HOWARD: OK, well thanks for joining us, Dr. Stern., STERN: Thanks for having me., HOWARD: That's Dr. Robert Stern of Boston University from the Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center. , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
500,[Lawmakers Consider Raising State's Minimum Wage],"[BARBARA HOWARD: Massachusetts is looking at raising its $11 an hour minimum wage. State lawmakers are considering an increase, and, if they fail to act, the issue could go to the voters. WGBH State House reporter Mike Deehan joins us from Beacon Hill as legislators begin a debate over how much lower wage workers should earn. Hi, Mike., MIKE DEEHAN: Good afternoon, Barbara., HOWARD: So you've been covering a hearing on raising the minimum wage today. What exactly are the lawmakers considering?, DEEHAN: The bill before the Labor and Workforce Development Committee would incrementally increase the minimum amount workers here can be paid from the current $11 an hour up to $15 an hour by 2021., HOWARD: Well that's a pretty significant jump. Why such a big increase?, DEEHAN: Economists backing the increase say that $15 an hour is really what it would take to elevate the poorest workers into more economic security. They've argued that smaller increases over that time period don't keep up with the cost of living and the cost of housing. So the pay hikes don't have the impact for the lower class that they were intended to have. A rep. —  Dan Donahue from Worcester — is the lead House sponsor of the bill., [CLIP OF REP. DAN DONAHUE OF WORCESTER], ""We need to have a living wage and it's time for the legislature to step up. It's time for us to come together and find a way to get to $15 an hour at the bare minimum and make sure that everyone can provide for their families, have a safe pathway to the middle class and make sure they’re [stable] in our economy."", HOWARD: OK, now business interests and employers opposed the last increase the state passed back in 2014. So what are they saying these days?, DEEHAN: Business leaders representing retail stores, supermarkets, restaurants and other low wage employers are urging the lawmakers to be cautious when considering this. These opponents are saying that a $15 minimum wage would lead to higher prices for consumers, and it could put small businesses out of business entirely. But it's important to note here that some business groups, mostly in sectors that already pay above the minimum, like tech and some other higher end employers, are supportive of the increase., HOWARD: Well, the hearing today, it was kind of a preview of something that could end up on the 2018 ballot as a referendum. Now, do you think voters are likely to decide this one themselves?, DEEHAN: The coalition behind the wage increase is backed by some of the big guns of organized labor, like the Massachusetts Teachers Association and the Service Employees International Union, the SEIU. They're launching this as kind of a two-pronged attack. The first is this bill, and they hope they can get through the legislature to have them vote on it this session. But if the legislature fails to take it up, they're ready to mount a ballot question campaign for 2018., HOWARD: Well, polls have shown that voters do favor a higher minimum wage. So what's stopping supporters from just waiting until 2018?, DEEHAN: Ballot campaigns can be extremely expensive, especially when you're up against the Walmarts and McDonald's of the world — not that labor also doesn't have pretty deep coffers. So the legislature now has a chance to make a deal with both sides to prevent that from going forward. Otherwise, you know, get ready for a fight next year with ads and the whole — everything that ballot campaigns that we've seen in the past [have done], but maybe even more so., HOWARD: OK, thanks so much for joining us, Mike., DEEHAN: You're welcome., HOWARD: That's WGBH State House reporter Mike Deehan, checking in from Beacon Hill., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

507,"[As More Sober Houses Seek Certification, Challenges Arise]","[At the Bennington House, a certified sober home in Quincy, the house rules are prominently placed on the refrigerator. Attending several AA or NA meetings a week, doing chores, taking drugs tests and meeting curfew are mandatory. While residents didn’t want to be interviewed, the managers were anxious to talk about how this kind of setting is essential to transitioning back into society and staying sober., “You can't go from a solid program to just back on your own because it turns into chaos for you,” said Josh Silva Sheehan, operations director of the Bennington House. “Then everything's in your face. You have to slowly, gradually get into it and be prepared.”, Sheehan, a recovering addict himself, credits sober homes for his survival. He's so passionate about their effectiveness that he has made a career out of managing them, overseeing five other sober homes in Quincy. Mel Trulby, the operations manager of Bennington House, says living in a home with peer-to-peer support increases the odds of staying sober., “If you're living with like-minded people who have that type of lifestyle and working on their recovery, and working on getting stable ... and you see, if I'm living with someone who I see struggle through situations during the day, there's also that support system,” Trulby said., Sober houses are often conflated with halfway houses, but the main distinction is that sober houses do not provide treatment, as they’re often the last step for someone coming out of rehab. Another distinction – there aren't any restrictions on who can open a sober house. Tenants in both halfway houses and sober houses pay to live there., “I don't think just anybody can open a sober house. If they're going to do it, they've got to do it right,"" Sheehan said. ""Don't do it because of the money.” , Sober homes are not state-regulated because they don’t provide medical treatment, but many saw the need to set some standards. So operators created the non-profit Massachusetts Alliance for Sober Housing (MASH). In partnership with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, MASH is now the state’s authority on certifying sober homes. Executive Director Marie Graves says the response has been overwhelming. To date, they have certified 157 homes with 40 more on the waiting list., “People are really wanting to do the right thing. They are wanting to come together as an entity and organization, share best practices to provide the most quality sober homes that we possibly can,” Graves said., Becoming MASH-certified is voluntary, but there’s good reason to join. Under Massachusetts law, any treatment or correctional facility that receives state funding can only refer people to MASH-certified homes. Still, some argue that’s not good enough. Back in Quincy, City Councilor Brian Palmucci has proposed an ordinance that would regulate how a sober house is established., “I think what is most concerning to residents is that they go to sleep one night, they wake up the next morning and there's a sober home that's opened up next to them in a predominantly residential neighborhood with no warning, no communication, no discussion about who's going to be there, how many people, what their backgrounds are, and also, more importantly, who the operators are,” said Palmucci., One thing the measure calls for is notifying the city 30 days in advance of opening a sober house., “You'll have an opportunity then to meet with city officials and have a plan presented as to how you plan to operate your sober home, what the qualifications are of the folks running the sober home,” he said. ""Because currently, there's no way for them to tell what's a sober home that's actually focused on recovery and what’s a sober home that's focused on collecting monthly rent payments and making money."", Despite mandatory drug testing and curfews, there have been overdose deaths at sober houses in Massachusetts over the years. Silva Sheehan agrees there are a lot of sober house operators that don’t do the right thing and need to be held accountable. , “Do it because you mean it, and if you're doing it about the money, then get the proper management in there to run it properly if you don't want to run it properly,"" he said. ""Because it's not safe, and we're talking about lives. There's a reason why that [sic] we don't have ODs or deaths – because we do it correctly.”, Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

512,[MGH Team In Texas To Treat Patients Hit By Harvey And By Chronic Health Problems],"[Rosenberg, Texas — A medical team from Massachusetts General Hospital is in the small city of Rosenberg, Texas, about 45 minutes southwest of Houston. The city was badly flooded during Tropical Storm Harvey when the Brazos River overflowed. In the weeks since the storm, the MGH team has set up a mobile clinic in a local church. And the team is finding the storm exacerbated health problems that already existed in the low-income community., “I have a problem to get the medication,” Magdalena O’Neill told nurse practitioner Jean Bernhardt. O'Neill explained she came to the mobile clinic at Our Lady of Guadalupe hoping to get a prescription she needed. “This medication help [sic] me for all the pain,"" she said., “This is something that we don't have here, and we can't prescribe here,” Bernhardt said. She recommended a clinic in Houston that could provide the meds and the dental care O'Neill needs, free of charge. But it’s 40 miles away from O’Neill’s home. , “Whatever would be closest for us,"" said O'Neill's husband, Terry. ""We’re senior citizens. Whatever be [sic] convenient. We just can’t get to Houston all the time.”, It’s a problem this temporary clinic sees a lot., “Access to health care for this population of people is limited,” said Lindsey Martin, the team leader for the group of nurse practitioners and pharmacists from Massachusetts General Hospital who were sent to Texas by the international non-profit Project Hope to run the clinic. “And then you bring in something like a flood or a hurricane — so whatever stock of medications they had is then wiped away,"" Martin said. ""They don't have the financial resources, and they don't have the access to obtain those again.”, Martin said they keep seeing patients with chronic conditions like diabetes or hypertension that went untreated in the weeks after the storm, and minor injuries that have gotten worse over the last few weeks. “Because now we're in the phase where if they were hurt during the storm and they didn't get treated now they're coming in and they have infections and cellulitis and that kind of stuff.”, , Credit: Houston Public Media, Dr. Harry Owens, Jr. is at the clinic from Oregon, and has responded to health crises all over the world for Project Hope. He said, as with any disaster, the patients are stressed. “They'll say, 'I'm anxious, I'm having some chest pain, my heart is beating very fast.'”, Providing care for that kind of thing means more than just prescribing pills. “One of the most important things is to ask, ‘What is your story? Please tell me your story. Tell me what's going on.’ And listen, actively listen. Their being able to tell the story to somebody — like a nurse, a doctor a priest, a deacon, somebody like that — helps.” , Of course, sometimes what patients really need is medication. And the clinic’s been having a hard time keeping enough in stock. Carmela Berlin is a pharmacist with the Mass General team. She picked up some of the bottles in the makeshift pharmacy and shook them to show how few pills were in them., “This is it,"" she said. ""I have one tablet of that medicine. These are all the blood pressure medications we have and for the populations that are coming in it's like, every other prescription is for high blood pressure medication.”, They’re also running low on insulin, which a lot of diabetic patients lost during the storm, because it needs to be refrigerated, and people lost power., The medical team visited homes in Rosenberg to get a sense of the needs and to invite people to come in to the clinic. Lindsey Martin of MGH said she met a family that was flooded out last year., “They were living in this storage shed outside of their house because their house had been condemned from the previous storm,” she said. The couple was talking about what to do next. The husband said it was time to move somewhere else. “And the wife said I want to stay because this is all I have. And the next storm will come, and we'll ride it out because there's nothing else out there for me.”, Martin said she’s been struck by the fact that some people here just don’t see any opportunity for themselves outside of the home they know, even if it’s been completely devastated., Another woman came into the clinic with blood pressure so high that she was in danger of having a stroke. But she was undocumented, and didn’t want to go to the emergency room because she was scared she’d be deported., “And I keep reminding myself I'm in Houston, Texas, that this is the United States of America,"" Martin said. ""And, you know, I think we sort of pride ourselves on taking care of our people. And I'm just seeing a lot of people that are not being taken care of.”, The clinic will be open in Rosenberg at least through the end of the week. But after it’s gone, the community will still have some significant health needs. Martin said she now sees there are some systemic problems that need to be addressed before Rosenberg can fully recover, so they’ll be in better shape when, inevitably, the next storm comes. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
513,[LISTEN: Cassini Spacecraft Completes Mission Around Saturn],"[Barbara Howard: The mission of the Cassini spacecraft launched almost 20 years ago to study Saturn and its moons is complete. Cassini ran out of fuel at long last today and plunged into the planet's atmosphere. One of the many scientists who worked on Cassini over its run has Massachusetts ties. Dr. Richard French is a professor of astrophysics and astronomy at Wellesley College. He was at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena California today monitoring Cassini. He's with us on the line to discuss the spacecraft's mission. Thanks for joining us, Dick., Richard French: I'm grateful for the opportunity., Barbara Howard: So, first of all, give us some background on what Cassini was all about., Richard French: Cassini was an international mission that was conceived in the mid and late 1980s to go back to Saturn after the very successful Voyager spacecraft that explored Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, the outer solar system. Those earlier spacecraft had seen Saturn just flying by. And the Cassini mission was to go back and study Saturn in detail by orbiting the spacecraft for years., Barbara Howard: Well, how did you get involved in the mission? What was your role?, Richard French: My ultimate role was to be the team leader for one of the 12 instruments on the spacecraft, the so-called radio science instrument. We use the radio signal as a scientific tool to study Saturn and Titan's atmosphere and rings and to do other scientific experiments., Barbara Howard: What kind of research has come out of Cassini? What's to be learned?, Richard French: The most marvelous part about the Cassini mission is the great variety of things that were there to be explored. Saturn is an amazingly diverse environment. First, there is the moon Titan appropriately named Titanic. It would be its own planet if it were orbiting the sun, and it has an atmosphere denser than the one we're breathing. It has rivers and oceans of methane and liquid ocean interior. There are a host of other moons. The rings, the interior storms on Saturn that we study from the earth. So it's a very rich and diverse world with many, many things to learn., Barbara Howard: Are you more involved in doing research in the transmissions from Cassini or were you actually hands on with the machine itself?, Richard French: Well, a little bit in between. Everybody who's on the science team participated in the design of the mission itself and all of the detailed planning of the observations and in the execution of getting the spacecraft to a point where we wanted to [sic] a particular time. And then, in analyzing the data. And I think one of the lessons that was most gratifying and interesting to learn is that scientists aren't necessarily trained to be cooperative, but on a mission like this, you learn very quickly the social skills not to be arguing that your science is better than everybody else because after 20 years, that argument gets a little stale., Barbara Howard: Well, you guys worked together to put this thing together. I understand you started back in 1990 on the project. Is that right?, Richard French: That's right., Barbara Howard: And you had to have some affection, I would think, for this little space ship being launched way out there. I mean, what was it like today to watch it come to an end?, Richard French: It was … it was overwhelmingly emotional in a way I hadn't anticipated. There have been two metaphors I think that have been used: One of them is to think of Cassini as almost a family member that's valiantly fighting against the fatal disease and eventually it will lose the battle against tumbling into the atmosphere and that's … I can't help but be a little bit of a morose attitude and a sense of loss. But another metaphor is that Cassini ran a long race and we’re cheering it across the finish line. I tried very hard to accept the latter cheerful metaphor, but I found myself very sad at the loss of what really felt like a family member., Barbara Howard: Take me there. While you were watching these final moments, what was it like for you?, Richard French: It was remarkable. So, we could see a little radio signal displayed in a complex pattern on the screen and to those of us who've been looking at these patterns over the years, it was like watching a heartbeat on CSI as a patient is about to be given electroshock therapy, where we're waiting for the signal to dip to indicate that the spacecraft had finally tumbled into the atmosphere and we could hear audible gasps in the audience. And then, when the final signal was gone, and we knew that Cassini really was no more, I made use of the Kleenex that had been appropriately provided in my chair and just found myself weeping., Barbara Howard: So it was a pretty emotional moment?, Richard French: I think most of us recovered quickly and felt an enormous pride at the opportunity to have worked in an international team of thousands on arguably the most successful space mission ever. I'm, you know, honored to have had a chance to do that and to share my love of space with others. And I think at a time when facts have a malleability, that those of us would wish that when you actually can show something to be true, it would be believed. Participating in something that is really science based and excites the entire public beyond political boundaries, feels like a precious opportunity., Barbara Howard: Well thanks for joining us, Dr. French., Richard French: You're welcome., Barbara Howard: That’s Dr. Richard French. He is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Wellesley College, and he's one of the scientists who worked on Cassini, the spacecraft that for nearly 20 years has been surveying Saturn and its moons. Cassini spent the final day of its fuel today sent out a final transmission as it entered Saturn's atmosphere. Dr. Richard French was there to monitor that., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

515,[Is Public Money Preserving Church History Or Funding Religion?],"[Drive down Acton’s main street, and you’re surrounded by history. On one side, the Town Green features a towering monument honoring Acton’s Revolutionary War soldiers. Across the street, the town hall has been repainted beige with green and brown trim, its original colors.   Acton’s Town Meeting overwhelmingly approved a plan to spend more than $100,000 in Community Preservation Act (CPA) funding to restore another historic building: the Congregational Church.   , “The church building represents the entire history of Acton. It’s intertwined with the growth of the town from its very first days,” said Peter Berry, an Acton selectman., He points out that when Acton got its charter, it also got the church — a place where the congregation gathered not only to worship, but also to resolve civic matters., “That’s really where the New England town meetings came from — people gathering in churches to discuss government affairs,"" Berry said. , Located on one side of the Town Green, The Congregational Church is a sprawling building with peeling white paint. The CPA money — a combination of local real estate taxes and a registry of deeds surtax — would fund a plan to restore the building and its stained glass windows.   One of the windows is a depiction of Jesus., “When people came here in the beginning, many came here for religious freedom. They were trying to escape from governments and churches which forced them to pay taxes to churches they didn’t belong to,” said Ron Madnick., Madnick, who lives in Worcester, once led the local American Civil Liberties Union chapter. He’s now with a national group called Americans United For Separation of Church and State. When he heard from a couple of Acton taxpayers upset about funding the Congregational Church renovation, he quickly found more. Americans United filed a lawsuit on their behalf. Their quest to prevent CPA money from being used for church renovations is now before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court., “We’re questioning the use of that money for religious organizations, since there’s an amendment that says it can’t be used for that purpose,"" said Madnick., The court’s decision could have far-reaching implications. Over the last 15 years, CPA money has been used to fund the renovations of about 300 churches across Massachusetts, including the Swedenborg Chapel in Harvard Square., Built from stone and set back on a patch of green grass, the chapel stands in sharp contrast to the modern buildings that surround it. A $50,000 CPA grant paid for repairs Cole says the congregation could not afford., , “It was such a boost to the community to have that money and keep things up. If we’re going to have this beautiful building, we want it to be in good repair,” said Rev. Sage Cole, pastor of the Swedenborg Chapel., Cole presides over a congregation of just 15 people. It’s an extreme example of a problem facing many religious institutions: declining attendance. But churches, including this one, are also used for public meetings and concerts. Cole says they should continue to qualify for CPA money., “We are part of the community, too. So it would certainly be strange to limit a whole portion of the population from receiving that kind of support, and churches in particular kind of have a historical significance,” said Cole., But can public money preserve a church’s history without supporting its religion? It’s a question now in the Commonwealth’s highest court.  , Editor's note:  An earlier version of this story indicated that Town Meeting is held in Acton's Town Hall.  It's held at Acton-Boxborough Regional High School.  , Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

517,[Man Imprisoned For 32 Years Speaks Out After Prosecutors Drop Case],"[BARBARA HOWARD: After 32 years in prison, Victor Rosario is officially a free man. He will not be tried again on the murder and arson charges that put him behind bars in the first place. The case stems back to a 1982 fire in Lowell that killed eight people, including five children. Back then, investigators ruled it an arson, but the science of investigating fires has come a long way since then, and in May, the state's highest court agreed that the fire might actually have been accidental. In 2014, Rosario was freed on $25,000 bail awaiting a new trial. Then, last Friday, Middlesex County District Attorney Marion Ryan's office decided not to pursue the court case any longer., Victor Rosario was 24 years old at the time of the fire. He's now 60. He remembers that night. He acknowledges that he and two friends were buying drugs at the house next door when the fire started., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), VICTOR ROSARIO: I smelled, I smelled there was something that was burning ... I mean, I’m trying to break a window, trying to get inside the house and trying to save the people., HOWARD: Rosario was arrested. The same investigators who ruled the fire an arson also got a confession from Rosario. Much has been written in recent years about confessions — of forced or coerced confessions. Rosario’s lawyers successfully argued that while there was a translator, their client, Rosario, was interrogated in English. And when asked to sign a document, Rosario, they say, was suffering from alcohol withdrawal and the confusion and hallucinations that can go with that., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), ROSARIO: They only [gave] me a piece of paper, and for me, I was thinking that I was going home., HOWARD: And so you signed. , ROSARIO: That's what I signed. , HOWARD: So you signed a confession., HOWARD: In that confession, Rosario also implicated his two friends, but the case against them fell apart when Rosario refused to testify against them in court. Instead, he steadfastly proclaimed their innocence and his own., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), ROSARIO: Yes. Yes, I was [an] innocent man, and I'm still [an] innocent man. , HOWARD: And the Garcias brothers?, ROSARIO: They [were] innocent, too., HOWARD: But Rosario has not been exonerated. Here's what the Middlesex County district attorney Marion Ryan wrote, and I quote, ""In light of the court's rulings, the passage of time and its impact on the evidence, we have concluded that we cannot sustain our high burden of proof in a new trial."", But, she stopped short of actually clearing Rosario. That leaves a cloud of suspicion. Rosario was asked about that., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), ROSARIO: Whosoever continues thinking about my character, about who I am — I know who I am: I’m an innocent man that did 32 years in prison for a crime that I did not commit., HOWARD: As Rosario spent all those years in prison, many of his relatives — his parents, his uncles, and aunts — died., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), ROSARIO: The hardest thing for me was the last time that I saw my mom. My mother came and said to me, ‘Son, this is the last time that I come to visit you.’ I saw it in her eyes how much she wanted me to be out, and that was the hardest thing. And I said, ‘Ma, why (sic) you say that?' A month later, my mother passed away., HOWARD: Rosario found religion in prison. He became a pastor. It was there he met his wife, who taught a class. For the past three years, while Rosario has been awaiting a new trial, there's been a sense of dread — the possibility of getting sent back to prison., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), ROSARIO: My wife [waited] for me for 22 years.

It's a completely ... a burden, it's a release. It's freedom., HOWARD: Rosario says stepping out of prison had been a real shock — the sights and the smells. After being surrounded by institutional green walls, the bright colors were jarring, the smell of perfume overwhelming. The world had changed, especially technology — he'd never even had a cell phone. But it was the internet that helped him connect with his daughter. Rosario had been a teenage father, and he says his daughter Maria was five years old when he went to prison., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), ROSARIO: Finally, two weeks ago, I found her in New York. She’s with me right now. , HOWARD: She's with you, she came up to Boston?, ROSARIO: Yes., HOWARD: How old is she now?, ROSARIO: Forty-one., HOWARD: She's 41 years old. What does she make of this? Is she angry with you?, ROSARIO: No. She’s not judging me for anything., HOWARD: Do you feel like you lost — you must feel like you lost a lot of time with your children?, ROSARIO: Yes, yes, yes., HOWARD: Is that one of the worst things about it?, ROSARIO: It is, it is, it is. You can never get it back., HOWARD: Rosario says that he and his daughter stayed up all night talking. He was asked whether all of this leaves him bitter or angry., (SOUND CLIP OF INTERVIEW WITH VICTOR ROSARIO), ROSARIO: The way I look at it ... it’s a decision that person made. I have to love, I have to forgive. And forgiveness, for me, has been one of the most biggest key (sic) to liberate not only myself, but to liberate other people. I forgive the DAs, I forgive the government.

You get immunity,” she said “And who is it going to be? I don’t know.”, National Security expert Juliette Kayyem is the founder of Kayyem solutions, host of the SCIF podcast and a contributor to CNN and WGBH.

527,[Meet Harvard's First Full-Time Muslim Chaplain],"[Since Harvard University is nearly four centuries old, nearly everything that happens on campus has already happened before. But as the arrival of Harvard’s new Muslim chaplain shows, there are still some exceptions to that rule., But first, the backstory. On a purely human level, the most remarkable thing about Khalil Abdur-Rashid becoming Harvard’s first full-time Muslim chaplain is that he was alive to take the job., ""I was walking home one night from class, walked through the wrong neighborhood, and I got mugged,"" said Abdur-Rashid, recalling an incident that occurred in 1995, when he was a student at Georgia State University in Atlanta. ""The person pulled out a gun and pointed it point blank at my face. I gave them my wallet. They wanted my watch."", The watch, he adds, was a family heirloom with which he was loathe to part. So he hurled it angrily at his attacker., ""He pulled the trigger,"" Rashid recalled. ""And when he pulled the trigger, the gun jammed ... The gun jammed, and I ran."", That brush with death in Atlanta sent Abdur-Rashid into a period of deep introspection and ultimately led him to embrace Islam., ""I grew up in a convert family,"" he said. ""I went to the mosque and the [Southern Baptist] church., ""My mother ... she gave me the Quran, and she gave the Bible, and she said, 'Read both. Make your own decision.' And I read both,"" Abdur-Rashid said. ""For me, personally, I understood the Quran better. I had a lot of questions that didn't get answered, but ... the message, for me, made sense. It spoke to the way I was at the moment."", Later, when a job as a social worker left him feeling spiritually unfulfilled, Abdur-Rashid took another leap, quitting to attend an Islamic seminary in Turkey. Now, after stints in New York (at Columbia University) and Dallas (at Southern Methodist University), he's setting up shop in Cambridge, where his primary responsibilities will be serving Harvard's Muslim undergraduates and grad students. , ""Students aren’t just cerebral beings,"" he says, explaining the rationale for his work. ""They’re spiritual beings as well. They have existential concerns. They have spiritual concerns ... At the very least, young students who are [freshmen] and sophomores are experiencing some kind of identity concerns."", And for young American Muslims, he adds, the issue of identity can be especially fraught., , ""These students come to college with a perception of being a member of a faith tradition that labels them as an other, even though they may be born here,"" he said. ""That’s a projection they have to get over., ""It’s not just about understanding that there were Muslim slaves here. It’s also understanding that the forefathers of this country had encounters with Islam."", The Harvard chaplains’ office is substantial, with more than 30 men and women representing a host of faiths and denominations. But even though he's a newcomer to campus, Abdur-Rashid stands out. He’s one of only two full-time university chaplains and the first chaplain ever to be hired directly by the Harvard president's office., Back in January, Harvard President Drew Faust announced her intention to hire a full-time Muslim chaplain in a letter that sharply criticized President Trump's decision to ban travel from several predominantly Muslim countries. At the time, Faust wrote that she hoped the move would ""bring a welcome measure of further institutional support for valued members of our University who have particular reason to feel a sense of vulnerability at this time."", When I asked Abdur-Rashid if his job is inherently political, though, he demurred. , ""There has been, since 9/11, a need for a strong presence amongst Muslim Americans — to be a voice in representing their own faith, their own tradition, their own self in speaking for themselves,"" he said. ""And we have lacked., ""To have a consistent voice that meets the needs of Muslim students is ... a moral decision, not a political one,"" Abdur-Rashid continued., Still, it's clear that Abdur-Rashid's own conception of Islam has concrete political implications. , ""You have to cultivate a relationship with the divine that’s intrinsically connected to ... everything around you,"" he explained. ""People, objects, plants, animals, the environment, everything., ""Preservation of life,"" he added. ""That means supporting the lives of undocumented immigrants. Supporting the lives of DACA students, because part of life is insuring strong families."", On Friday, Abdur-Rashid will lead morning prayers at Harvard’s Memorial Church. It will be a personal milestone — and a potent reminder that Harvard, originally founded to train Puritan clergymen, is changing with the times., Adam Reilly is a reporter at WGBH-TV's Greater Boston.]"

President Trump said yes, though many others not only disagreed, they say his Election Integrity Commission is a threat to voting rights. The issue came to New Hampshire today at the commission’s second public meeting, just days after a report found that more than 6,000 out-of-state drivers’ license-holders registered to vote in New Hampshire on election day last November. Last week the commission’s vice chairman, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach cited the report as “proof” of evidence of voter fraud. Today, Kobach seemed to back away from that claim, saying “specifically in the column it says it 'appears' that non-residents may have tipped the results...and I'm still wondering if that was the right word.” New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner responded, saying “The problem that has occurred because of what you wrote is that - the question of whether our election - as we have recorded it -is real and valid.

529,[LISTEN: Former Coast Guardsman Adrian Loya Sentenced To Life For 2015 Cape Cod Murder],"[Barbara Howard: A Cape Cod jury has found Adrian Loya guilty of first degree murder after about 14 hours of deliberations. The jury convicted Loya, a former Coast Guardsman, who was charged with killing a fellow Coast Guard officer, Lisa Trubnikova, at her home in Bourne, on Cape Cod, back in 2015. He was also convicted on counts related to the shooting of Trubnikova’s wife and a responding Bourne police officer. Both were injured, but survived. Loya took steps to impede emergency workers responding to the scene, including the placement of incendiary devices. He also intentionally set his car on fire. Following the jury's decision today, Loya was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. WGBH contributor Patrick Flannery has been following the trial. He's with us on the line to talk about the case. Thanks for joining us, Patrick., Patrick Flannery: Thank you, Barbara., Barbara Howard: So some background first. Adrian Loya, apparently he'd been planning this murder for months, isn’t that right?, Patrick Flannery: For the better part of two years, as a matter of fact … He admitted as much. The evidence that was brought to the jury [was] a series of interviews with investigators just a couple of hours after his arrest in 2015. ... Adrian Loya opened up and talked very openly about how for the past year and seven months or so, he had been planning an attack of vengeance that stemmed to an incident that happened in 2012 in which Loya claimed that Lisa Trubnikova had sexually assaulted him. He classified it later as mental rape. He took that to the chain of command, and the Coast Guard filed a complaint. That backfired. Instead, he was found [to have] been abusing his position to get closer to Trubnikova. And that is where his angry tirade began, and that's when the planning essentially began., Barbara Howard: Sounds like he was kind of stalking her. So Loya’s defense tried to convince the jury that Loya was mentally ill, not responsible. Can you talk about that?, Patrick Flannery: Yes. It was their decision ultimately to find out whether he was able to determine right from wrong when he committed this act. Three psychiatrists for the Commonwealth as well as one for the defense testified last week. None of them could really agree on which mental disorder that Adrian Loya suffered from. They each had four diagnoses. That didn't matter — the consensus being he still acted with premeditation and with extreme cruelty in the eyes of the jury., Barbara Howard: Well prior to leaving the courtroom to deliberate, Loya mouthed something to the jury, right?, Patrick Flannery: This happened Friday afternoon just moments before the jury was dismissed to deliberate. He audibly said the word guilty., Barbara Howard: OK. Well Lisa Trubnikova’s family spoke today following Loya’s conviction. What did they have to say?, Patrick Flannery: Her surviving spouse, Anna, asked the judge in a brief speech before sentencing to not spare him — to give him the maximum penalty, and that's exactly what her parents had asked for as well., Barbara Howard: Loya has now been convicted and sentenced to life in prison. The judge reached his sentencing decision really really quickly. Usually a sentence is handed down months after a conviction. What happened?, Patrick Flannery: It's case by case we're told. In this particular trial, where we had 30 counts being weighed by the jury, and the fact that they had come to this decision knowing that his mental disorder did not come into play, the judge determined today was the day to go ahead and make that ruling., Barbara Howard: OK. So it's life in prison without the possibility of parole. Again, thanks for joining us, Patrick., Patrick Flannery: Barbara thanks so much., Barbara Howard: That's WGBH contributor Patrick Flannery. He has been following the case of Adrian Loya, the former Coast Guardsman convicted today for the 2015 murder of fellow Coast Guard officer Lisa Trubnikova at her home in Bourne on Cape Cod.

531,[Massachusetts Imposes Record Fine On 2016 Charter School Supporters],"[Barbara Howard: It is the biggest campaign finance settlement in state history. Do you remember that ballot measure last fall to lift the cap on the number of charter schools in Massachusetts? It turns out that the group that collected money to support that measure now has to pay a half million dollar settlement after being penalized by the Massachusetts Office of Campaign and Political Finance. With us in the studio is WGBH News Contributor Maurice Cunningham, a UMass Boston political science professor who's been tracking so-called dark money in last year's charter school campaign. Thanks for coming in Maurice., Maurice Cunningham: Great to be here., Barbara Howard: Well, first it should be noted that despite the large sums of money that this group poured into the campaign, the measure to lift that charter school caps, it was rejected last fall by the voters. Now this group that pushed hard for the measure — the group that got itself in trouble here — it called itself ""Families for Excellent Schools."" But was it really families for excellent schools?, Maurice Cunningham: It wasn't really families the way we think of it. In fact, it was backed by a group of billionaires and near billionaires — plutocrats putting millions of dollars of their own money behind this., , Barbara Howard: Well, what exactly did this group ""Families for Excellent Schools"" do wrong?, Maurice Cunningham: Well, what they did was they hid the actual contributors, and the OCPF, the Office of Campaign and Political Finance, found two important things. One, ‘""Families for Excellent Schools"" was a political committee and needed to register with OCPF. And two, that they had been hiding the true identities of the contributors. That's illegal in Massachusetts., Barbara Howard: That's a violation of state campaign finance law as I understand., Maurice Cunningham: That is correct., Barbara Howard: OK, so who is behind the group ""Families for Excellent Schools""?, Maurice Cunningham: Mostly financial service money, a lot from Massachusetts, a lot more from New York and other states — people who could write a check for a million dollars at the drop of a hat, and so all of them wrote several million dollar checks., Barbara Howard: Well, that's what struck me when I looked at this list. Now the ""Families for Excellent Schools"" as part of this settlement had to disclose a real list of donors who put nearly $20 million into the campaign to lift the charter caps — and we will post that list to our web site WGBHNews.org — but a few things on that list pop out … what you said, that some were from out of state. Also the size of the donations and the fact that the group itself, ""Families for Excellent Schools,"" [is] not local. It lists a New York City address. There were also other out-of-state donors. A member of the Wal-Mart family from Arkansas comes to mind, but there are also some well-known local investors. We see Bain Capital on the list founded by Mitt Romney and others. Why would these groups be so interested in lifting the cap on charter schools?, Maurice Cunningham: I wish we could ask them directly, but unfortunately they hide. That's what we know from this. However, I think it has to do with an animosity toward government, an animosity toward unions, particularly teachers unions, which advocate for greater funding for things like schools. Ultimately, it's about their taxes., Barbara Howard: Well, I understand some of the figures in the ""Families for Excellent Schools"" group also have connections to the Baker administration, the current governor?, Maurice Cunningham: Yes. At least two of the givers who are in the Baker administration — I think Sagan and Nunley — gave, I believe, over $700,000 between them. That's a lot of money, and they're actively serving in the Baker administration., Barbara Howard: Well, this is the biggest campaign finance penalty in state history. How does it compare to past the settlements?, Maurice Cunningham: Oh multiple several times — this is by far the biggest — I think the largest before was $185,000. This is well over $400,000. It's a huge, huge settlement. It sends a strong signal., Barbara Howard: And that money will be now going to the state's general fund, we should point out. And what's the upshot of all this for future ballot measure campaigns, do you think?, Maurice Cunningham: I think any group looking to spend ""dark money"" in Massachusetts has to be aware. They are now on notice that OCPF is going to look at these contributions and look at it very closely. And I think it puts a chill on the ""dark money"" operations in Massachusetts., Barbara Howard: OK, thanks so much for talking with us, Maurice., Maurice Cunningham: Glad to be here., Barbara Howard: That's WGBH News contributor and UMass Boston political science professor Maurice Cunningham. He has been following so-called ""dark money"" in Massachusetts ballot measure campaigns. , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
532,[U.S. Court Allows Suit Alleging ExxonMobil's Everett Tank Farm Is A Hazard To Proceed],"[A federal judge ruled on Tuesday that a Massachusetts environmental group has sufficient legal standing to proceed with a so-called citizen lawsuit filed against oil and gas giant ExxonMobil. 
	 
	U.S. District Judge Mark L. Wolf made the ruling after considering a motion by ExxonMobil to dismiss the lawsuit. 
	 
	The plaintiff, nonprofit Conservation Law Foundation, or CLF, claims that ExxonMobil has ignored requirements to prevent its oil storage and transfer site in Everett from discharging pollutants into the Mystic in heavy weather. 
	 
	The ExxonMobil oil terminal and storage facility in Everett is regulated by federal (EPA) and state (MassDEP) authorities, but federal environmental laws allow citizens and civilian groups, like CLF, to sue if they believe that authorities have failed to enforce the law. 
	 
	The timing of Tuesday's hearing, just days after Hurricane Irma pummeled Florida and the Atlantic South -- and after a Houston-area chemical plant exploded during Hurricane Harvey -- is essentially coincidental: the lawsuit was filed by CLF one year ago. 
	 
	But the recent storms loomed over the proceedings anyway. 
	 
	Lawyers for ExxonMobil have moved to have the case dismissed and argued that the Everett facility is compliant with its EPA-issued permit and that CLF has no legal standing to force the company to make changes to it. 
	 
	The case is unrelated to the high-profile investigation of ExxonMobil by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey into whether the company mislead the public as to the impact of fossil fuels on the climate. 
	 
	In a seventy-plus page complaint, CLF argues that the Everett facility has discharged pollutants into the Mystic River in violation of federally-permitted levels hundreds of times, and that ExxonMobil has failed to engineer the facility, which sits in a Hurricane-prone flood zone, to be able to prevent illegal discharges in the kind of severe weather events scientists link to climate change. 
	 
	Judge Wolf was skeptical of some of these claims, asking repeatedly whether CLF could show a threat to citizens that was immediate or ""immanent,"" -- and not fifty or one hundred years in the future. 
	 
	Attorney Daniel Toal, representing ExxonMobil, characterized CLF as demanding that the company adopt to hypothetical scenarios that are not required by its permit, which must be renewed periodically and approved by the EPA. 
	 
	But CLF lawyer Allan Kanner said that discharge records for the facility maintained by ExxonMobil and environmental officials show that the facility has already been unable or unwilling to prevent illegal levels of pollutants from entering the Mystic River., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

vacated his conviction and ordered a new trial. , The district attorney’s office filed a 
motion last week in Middlesex Superior Court stating that it would no longer pursue a retrial of Rosario, a former drug addict who was convicted of arson for a 1982 fire that killed eight people, including five children. More than three decades after the fire, Assistant District Attorney Thomas F. O’Reilly said many witnesses “are no longer available” and the state “cannot meet its burden” to prove Rosario is guilty. , Rosario’s story was first profiled by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting in an article published in the Boston Globe, titled, “Notorious Lowell arson case cast in doubt.’’ , The 
story, written by Nicas, at the time a student at Boston University, and journalism professor and investigative reporter Dick Lehr, found “grave shortcomings in the police inquiry and prosecution of Rosario, findings that suggest Rosario was wrongfully convicted.” , Rosario confessed to the crime after a more than five-hour police interrogation but later claimed he was delusional at the time, likely suffering from alcohol withdrawal. Among issues, the article raised questions about techniques used in witness identification, new information about fire-scene evidence, and the possibility of a false confession. , In 2014, Nicas wrote 
a blog post for NECIR describing how main findings in his story were included in the judge’s grounds for a new trial. “There was excitement, disbelief and a sense of vindication,’’ he wrote. “Later, the feeling became relief. Not just that we were right, but that Victor Rosario was free.” , Lehr also welcomed the prosecution’s decision not to re-open the case. “The DA, finally doing the right thing, is welcome good news.” , Rosario, now 60 years old, became an ordained minister in prison and married his wife Beverly in 1993. He started a nonprofit called Remember Those in Captivity Ministries Inc., which aims to strengthen ties between prisoners and their families. He is an advocate for the wrongfully convicted and an avid long-distance runner, completing the New York City marathon in 2016. , Monday, Rosario said the NECIR article “brought light into darkness” of his story. He was elated to no longer worry about facing a new trial on the 1982 case. “I feel like I want to fly,’’ he said. “I feel so joyful.” ,

546,[LISTEN: Patriots Take On Kansas City Chiefs in Season Opener Tonight],"[Barbara Howard: The New England Patriots — they are back in action tonight. Their season begins at home at Gillette Stadium in Foxboro this evening. They're taking on the Kansas City Chiefs. And with us on the line for a Patriots season preview is Jim McBride. He covers the Pats for The Boston Globe. Thanks for joining us, Jim., Jim McBride: Thanks for having me., Barbara Howard: So the Patriots they are riding high. They're coming off their big comeback Super Bowl win last season against the Atlanta Falcons, but quarterback Tom Brady, he is now 40 years old. What can we expect of him?, Jim McBride: I think you’re gonna see the same Tom Brady you've been seeing for the last 17 seasons. Just a guy that really shows no signs of aging. His fire is still there. He's still the guy that's running around practice like he's 23 years old, yelling at teammates, you know congratulating them on things and just, you know, a very consistent leader, and I don't suspect you'll see any drop off at all, even though he's 40. He’s already making it look like the new 30., Barbara Howard: OK. Well besides Brady, how is the rest of the offense looking? The Patriots are going to be without one of Brady's go to wide receivers. Julian Edelman. Edelman, of course, tore his ACL this pre season. So what's that going to mean?, Jim McBride: [They] kind of look a little different this year. You know, they're going to have more of a vertical threat with Brandin Cooks and Phillip Dorsett on the outside. And you know, speed was an emphasis this off season. So those guys are going to factor heavily in the offense along with Chris Hogan who is going to play a more versatile role, I believe. So I think you're going to see a quicker offense. This team won the Super Bowl last year without Gronk, and he's back, so I think it's a little bit of a different offense in that they're going to struggle to replace Edelman, at first, but I guess you'd say the silver lining of that injury, if there is one, is that it happened early enough in the year that Coach Belichick will be able to figure it out and make up for that production. Where I really think they’ll miss Julian is his kind of fiery attitude in that huddle. You know, other than Brady, that it's kind of a quiet group and Edelman was kind of that spark plug that came in and fired everyone up and kind of trash talked. And there's really not that guy right now, so it'll be interesting to see who emerges as a vocal leader on this offense other than Brady., Barbara Howard: And the defense, how’s that unit looking. Tell me more about that., Jim McBride: I think the front seven is kind of a question mark right now. You know, they kind of revamped the defensive position. They let go a couple of guys. I think you might see Dont’a Hightower whose kind of been the mainstay in the middle of this defense playing on the edge more to pressure the quarterback. So I think once they straighten up that front seven, it's going to be a formidable defense. They might take some lumps early on, but I think that like the offense, you're going to see a little difference, but kind of the same result., Barbara Howard: OK. Well what’s tonight’s opener against the Chiefs? Are the Patriots, are they looking like favorites to you?, Jim McBride: They're definitely the favorites. This team is battle tested. There's a lot of veterans. Kansas City is a very good team. They came on strong last year, but I think for them to come into Foxboro on opening night with the banner going up and the crowd going crazy — it's a tall task, and I think the Patriots, you know, traditionally very strong at home, so they're considered the favorite for a reason because they should win this game., Barbara Howard: Well looking beyond tonight, though, how do the Patriots stack up against the rest of their division the AFC East?, Jim McBride: Well I think they're once again, the class of the AFC East. I think the Dolphins could give them a run for their money, but I think Buffalo is kind of a rebuilding program, and the Jets are really in shambles once again. So unless something catastrophic happens, you can pencil them in as the AFC East champions., Barbara Howard: Can you see them doing a repeat? Another Super Bowl championship?, Jim McBride: Yes, absolutely. I know a lot of the talk [at the] beginning of year was, could this team go undefeated? I was never one of those guys. You know after Edelman got hurt, I think that makes the task even that much tougher. But I do think this team is clearly the favorites to get to the Super Bowl, and win it again. There’s some pitfalls in that schedule. But I think they should be favored in every game they play., Barbara Howard: Well have a good time at the game tonight, Jim., Jim McBride: Thanks for having me., Barbara Howard: That's Jim McBride. He covers the Patriots for the Boston Globe the Pats season gets under way tonight as they take on the Kansas City Chiefs at home in Foxborough.,  , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

Pre-K and Kindergarten start Monday, September 11. The administration has several new plans this year, and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Superintendent Tommy Chang spoke to WGBH's Morning Edition about changes for the upcoming school year and the first day back to school. , New Bus Routes, This year the district is using a new scheduling system, based on an algorithm crafted by two MIT doctoral students. The new system cut about fifty routes from last year’s schedule and resulted in the layoffs of dozens of drivers. Officials say some buses will be more crowded, but they are confident more students will arrive at school on time. The new routing system is expected to save the district up to $5 million. Chang also said the new system will reduce carbon emissions., New Boilers and Windows, Chang said that the district invested $40 million and partnered with Massachusetts School Building Authority to upgrade boilers and windows over the summer., New School Lunches, Walsh noted that BPS has partnered with a new school lunch vendor to provide more fresh food options. Revolution Foods starts its three-year contract with the district this week and will provide 64,000 meals every school day. The shift comes after student and parents complained about too much frozen food., Breakfast in the Classroom, In fifty classrooms around the city, BPS will be serving breakfast at students' desks after the bell rings. Walsh and the district will be looking at the program’s effectiveness and the potential to expand it in upcoming years., Increased Graduation Rates, Walsh said the district’s high school graduation rate peaked last year at 74 percent. He added that although he’s proud, 74 percent is a C, and there’s room for improvement., Extended School Day, This year, BPS is lengthening the school day for students at 38 schools, adding what Chang says equates to 20 more days of learning. The district hopes the extended day will give more students time for enrichment programs like foreign language classes, arts programs, and personalized instruction. Chang says the additional learning time will help close achievement gaps., Listen to Morning Edition's Debrief with Mayor Marty Walsh., ,  , Listen to Morning Edition's Debrief with Superintendent Tommy Chang., , WGBH News’ coverage of K-12 education is made possible with support from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation., Tristan Cimini is a former producer for WGBH News’ K-12 Education Desk.

551,[LISTEN: Governor Baker Testifies About Healthcare on Capitol Hill],"[Barbara Howard: Governor Charlie Baker - he was in Washington, DC today, he was testifying about the American healthcare system, which is currently in a sort of limbo state. He was speaking before the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. The Affordable Care Act – Obamacare – is still the law of the land. But President Trump appears intent on repealing the ACA. WGBH Radio's Adam Reilly has been closely following Baker's appearance today. He joins me now in the studio. Hi, Adam., Adam Reilly: Hey, Barbara., Barbara Howard: So, were there any surprises in Baker's testimony today?, Adam Reilly: When it comes to his thoughts on healthcare, I wouldn't say so. We have known for quite a while now that Governor Baker is very concerned about a rapid repeal of the Affordable Care Act, if there isn't a carefully constructed replacement -- he made that clear once again today. At one point, he urged President Trump not to halt the subsidies that keep costs down for lower income people who are insured through the ACA. He said premiums would spike about 20 percent if the president did that, and that it would wreak unnecessary havoc on the insurance markets. Governor Baker also made bigger points about healthcare that would be familiar, I think, to you and me and anyone else who's followed the governor's career closely. For example, he thinks we can drive healthcare costs down with transparency about the cost of different procedures at different places and also by containing drug prices. So overall, I would say no big revelations on that front., Barbara Howard: What about the optics of Baker's appearance – did anything strike you as unexpected?, Adam Reilly: I don't know if I'd say unexpected, but definitely noteworthy. First off, I was struck by how amiable his back and forth with Elizabeth Warren –the U.S. senator from Massachusetts – was. She introduced him as someone who has considerable expertise when it comes to healthcare matters. She almost seemed proud to be introducing him as the governor of the state that she represents. And when she had a chance to question Baker, which came later on in today's testimony, they seemed to be working hand in glove. Let's listen to a little bit of an exchange that they had when Senator Warren asked Governor Baker about the implications of cutting those subsidies that I mentioned a moment ago., CLIP: [Elizabeth Warren] If the president's threat to cut cost sharing makes no sense financially - either for the federal government or for the states or for the families - can you think of any policy justification for threatening to blow up the health insurance marketplaces in Massachusetts and around the country?, [Governor Baker]: I said before I think it would be a bad idea. And I really appreciate the fact that you all are having a conversation about how to make sure that we continue to provide stabilization or create stabilization in a market that clearly needs it., Adam Reilly: I also thought it was interesting to watch the way Baker interacted with the other governors who he was testifying with - both Republican and Democratic - and the senators who were questioning them. He started off, I thought, maybe a little bit timid. He seemed like he, you know, was not fully comfortable being in this setting, but as the minutes and hours passed, I felt like we could see Governor Baker get more assertive, and his fellow governors – maybe because Baker used to run Harvard Pilgrim, maybe because of Massachusetts’ record as a healthcare trailblazer – they seemed to defer to him as the expert in their midst. And I thought the senators who were asking questions did the same., Barbara Howard: Given all that, I have to ask, here in Massachusetts, we love to speculate about possible national ambitions of our politicians., Adam Reilly: We do., Barbara Howard: …from Mitt Romney, Deval Patrick, Elizabeth Warren … Seth Moulton comes to mind. Did Baker say or did he do anything today that might stoke speculation about him having an eye beyond Massachusetts?, Adam Reilly: I don't think so. And compared to the people you just mentioned, the governor has never really offered a lot of fodder for those of us who love to play the 'will he or she go national' game. But having said that, if the national GOP ever decides that it wants to re-embrace moderate Republicanism, which is a long way away from right now, I think Baker indicated today that he could be a good standard bearer for the party. Take a listen to this back and forth that he had with Al Franken the Democratic senator from Minnesota., CLIP:  [Senator Franken] With a bipartisan effort, Massachusetts developed a system of health coverage that works. I think we may be second in the country. , [Governor Baker]: You just need to know my mom is a Democrat from Rochester, Minnesota., [Senator Franken]: I so love you., Adam Reilly: So that was kind of, you know, an enjoyable little coda to their exchange. And I think a reminder that Governor Baker has staked out this ideological middle ground - he's a Republican, [but] in many other states, he'd be a moderate Democrat and he is unusual in the Republican Party right now because of that., Barbara Howard: Thanks for keeping an eye on all this, Adam., Adam Reilly: My pleasure.

The Times report says the Red Sox ultimately acknowledged their skullduggery, but then filed their own complaint, claiming the Yankees used a camera from their TV network to steal signs as well.

557,[Lessons From Hurricane Katrina Might Not Stick],"[As the country cleans up after Tropical Storm Harvey, there are lessons to be learned from another major storm of the past: Hurricane Katrina., Among those lessons is the importance of the undocumented workforce., “New Orleans would not have come back, any city would not have come back from Hurricane Katrina, without the contributions of undocumented workers,” said national security expert Juliette Kayyem on BPR today., Kayyem explained that in 2006 and 2007, the recovery effort and rebuilding efforts were well underway., “[There were] not enough American bodies to do the jobs,” she said. “That’s great news. Building is good. People get paid. Small businesses get moving.”, Despite the boost to New Orleans that resulted from the rebuilding effort, Kayyem said the government made a crucial mistake — making too much room for outside contractors to do the work., She explained that the government favored speed and set up a regulatory system that favored out-of-state companies., “You want the mom and pop shops, because you want those people working. They’re going to hire their neighbors. What you saw in Hurricane Katrina was the Connecticut construction firm moving in,” she said. “You don’t want that.”, Kayyem explained how President George W. Bush loosened rules about checking IDs for workers in the wake of Katrina, which she said was consistent with his views about comprehensive immigration reform., In contrast, she called Texas’ immigration politics “hypocritical.”, “They all come out and say they hate undocumented illegal immigrants — someone like Ted Cruz — but you can’t find a single mayor, Republican or Democrat, either [body] of state legislature, anyone, who’s a proponent of the wall or who wants to get tighter on immigration,” said Kayyem., For Kayyem, Texan representatives are making a mistake in not harnessing the power of undocumented workers., “The lesson [from Katrina] is actually really something that we should take to heart right now,” she said., National security expert Juliette Kayyem is the host of the SCIF podcast, founder of Kayyem solutions and a contributor to WGBH and CNN.

559,[LISTEN: Red Sox Fess Up To Stealing Signs From New York Yankees],"[Barbara Howard: The Red Sox — they are in hot water. The team is accused of stealing signs, specifically pitching signs, from the New York Yankees and other teams … that was first reported by the New York Times. It was confirmed yesterday by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, who just happened to be at Fenway Park for last night's 19 inning win over the Toronto Blue Jays. With us to explain the sign stealing and just how much trouble the Sox could be in is Alex Speier. He covers baseball for The Boston Globe. Thanks for joining us Alex., Alex Speier: My pleasure, Barbara., Barbara Howard: So what exactly is it that the Red Sox are accused of doing?, Alex Speier: In this case, the Red Sox are accused not just of sign stealing, which is not illegal in baseball, but instead of using electronic devices in order to do so. Chiefly, sending a text message to an assistant trainer’s Apple Watch in the dugout, at which point the assistant trainer communicates information to the players to indicate what the signs that the catcher is giving to a pitcher mean, which in turn could give a Red Sox hitter insight into what's being thrown. It's a kind of complicated and elaborate scheme in some ways, or at least sounds like it, but it basically harkens to a tradition that's been, that’s existed for a long time, with the exception of the fact that there is an electronic implement, an Apple Watch involved in it., Barbara Howard: Is there any evidence that this alleged sign stealing helped the Red Sox?, Alex Speier: Well, so that's the tricky part. There are different schools of thought regarding whether or not sign stealing — whether or not how helpful sign stealing is. The Yankees allege that the Red Sox were helped considerably in a specific series at Fenway Park last month: August 18th through 20th when the Red Sox won two out of three games. That said, the Yankees pitchers have been somewhat dominant against the Red Sox throughout the rest of the year, so this is a terrible data set basically. In theory, it can help quite a bit, but from a practical standpoint, we don't have a means of discerning that impact., Barbara Howard: It was the Yankees who supposedly caught the Red Sox in the act, and I understand that the Red Sox have filed a counterclaim against the Yankees saying that they too have been stealing signs. Tell us about that., Alex Speier: Again, basically every team tries to steal signs. The question is what kinds of mechanisms you use in order to steal signs. The Red Sox have filed a complaint with Major League Baseball suggesting that the Yankees used a camera operated by the Yes Network, which broadcasts their games, to pick up signs that were being relayed from the Red Sox dugout to players on the field., Barbara Howard: Dave Dombrowski, the Sox president of baseball operations, he seemed to laugh it all off in his statements yesterday. Isn't this kind of a big deal or is it not?, Alex Speier: Eh … I suppose is the best way I can describe it. Again, it relates to a longstanding tradition of sign stealing. There are shenanigans that go on in the game fairly regularly. There have been plenty of allegations through the years of teams using cameras or using monitors in order to try to get a sign stealing advantage. In this case, it is kind of a big deal in that according to that New York Times report, not only did the Yankees catch the Red Sox, but the Red Sox fessed up to it. And so there's a clear violation of the law and, if that's the case, if there is a violation of a Major League Baseball policy, then there's going to be some kind of punishment., Barbara Howard: What sort of punishment might the Red Sox be facing?, Alex Speier: That is to be determined. The commissioners of the major sports leagues have enormous discretionary power. So as Rob Manfred said yesterday while he was at Fenway Park, if he wanted to, he could probably take wins away from the Red Sox. But he noted that precedent is never to overturn a victory, precisely because of what we were talking about earlier. It's almost impossible to discern the impact on a game of sign stealing, and so as a result, that's probably off the table. Almost certainly, there are going to be fines involved — whether or not there could be people subjected to suspensions, it would at least be a topic that Major League Baseball would likely explore.

I mean, if you watch national coverage of this, it will invariably link what's happening right now with the Red Sox and this Apple watch phenomenon to Spygate. Whether or not that's fair is another question entirely. And again, I think that we're dealing with fairly common efforts by teams not just in New England, but across sports in order to try to get informational advantages on their on their opponents., Barbara Howard: OK, thanks for joining us Alex., Alex Speier: My pleasure, Barbara Thank you., Barbara Howard: That's Alex Speier.

560,[Closing The Pay Gap],"[Asking the boss for more money is an awkward conversation for most. And it can be even more of an uphill battle for women., In the Greater Boston area, according to one recent study, women make 77 cents on the dollar compared to men.  But these days, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is pushing to eliminate that disparity, in part by training women to be better advocates for themselves., Since 2015, the city has been conducting free workshops that teach women how to figure out what they’re worth and then, how to get it. A report out this week indicates the program is working – with nearly half the participants surveyed said that they’ve either negotiated a raise or gotten a competitive salary at a new job., Megan Costello, executive director of women’s advancement for the city of Boston, whose office put on the workshops, and Ann Bookman, director of the Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy at the McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies at UMass Boston, joined Adam Reilly to discuss the report’s findings and what’s next in the city’s quest to eliminate the gender pay gap., Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"

562,[Plymouth County Police Try A New Approach To The Opioid Crisis],"[Across the country, the opioid crisis is hurting communities and families., The toll is particularly evident in Plymouth County. So far this year, more than 1,000 people have overdosed., On a recent night, melodious tunes filtered out from New Hope Chapel in Plymouth. About 100 people had gathered to remember those lost to opioids. With cell phone lights swaying, and people dabbing tears from their eyes, those in attendance sang and watched a slide show of community members who had recently died., Dave and Judy McCarthy came because of a phone call they’d received nearly a year ago from the hospital – it was about their daughter., ""Oh my gosh. It was 1:07 a.m.,” remembers Judy McCarthy, who’d been awakened by the call. The person on the other end of the line said: “‘I have some bad news.’”, Holding back tears, Judy McCarthy recounted learning that their daughter had died. “It was the worst phone call of my life."", , After getting painkillers for two back operations, their middle daughter, Colleen, had become addicted to opioids. Before she died of an overdose, Dave McCarthy says they knew their daughter was struggling, but they didn’t know where to turn for help., “You know what would be nice? To know someone cares that has an official status,” he said., Some police departments are trying to change the perception that they don't care – and change their tactics in addressing the opioid crisis., Captain John Rogers of the Plymouth Police Department has worked in law enforcement for 33 years. He has spent much of his career going after drugs, and he acknowledges the police haven’t always been sympathetic., “It’s tough. A lot of police officers think if someone is foolish enough to stick a needle of poison in their arm, then, that’s what it is.”, But, Rogers says, over the past few years there’s been a collective realization that the opioid crisis is “not something we can arrest our way out of."", As officers realize that substance use disorder, as it is now called, is a medical condition, they’re changing their approach., The Plymouth Police Department helped host the vigil in New Hope Church, and they host regular drop-in centers, where those addicted to opioids – and their families – can come to gather information and get connected to treatment programs., But local police have gone even further. All 27 police departments in Plymouth County have teamed up to share information about overdoses. This past summer they developed their first real-time database of who needs help., Roger says the database includes basic information about an overdose: “the name, where it happened, where they were transported to as far as a hospital facility. Anything like that.”, Then, the police departments have committed to sending a plainclothes officer to visit the person’s home within 24 hours., “We would knock on the door. ‘Hi, Plymouth Police. We understand Jimmy, Johnny, Debbie overdosed last night,’” Rogers says about a typical home visit., The police are not there to arrest anyone. Instead, they are there to offer resources for recovery. They’ve partnered with local healthcare providers such that each officer goes on home visits with a clinician or recovery coach., , Sergeant William Patterson, of the East Bridgewater Police, often does home visits. He says going within the 24-hour window is important: “It has to be a quick turnaround. These people are in crisis. They need help. And we want to go out and support them.”, Patterson says that right after a nonfatal overdose, some victims tell them not to swing by the next day. But, he says, they go anyway – and they haven’t been turned away., “We’ve never been told, ‘Hey, I don’t want to talk to you.’ ”, Some visits are just five minutes, while others last an hour or more., While there isn’t data from the whole county yet, about 85% of the people the Plymouth Police have visited accepted some kind of services. That’s anything from a bed in a detox facility to enrolling in treatment., During the home visit, they will help call around for a bed, figure out insurance coverage and, even, give a ride to a treatment facility if that’s necessary., East Bridgewater Police Chief Scott Allen says collaborating with all the other police departments in the county has solved a major problem., He says for years they had an inkling that ‘half of the overdoses in the city of Brockton were not from Brockton. They are from the surrounding suburbs, but there was no formal notification system or collaboration where we could share that information.”, Allen says with the county-wide initiative – called Plymouth County Outreach – they’ve solved this issue. Preliminary results suggest that in 45 percent of the overdoses in Plymouth County, “the victims don’t overdose in the town they live in, but in a neighboring town.”, “Now, we can connect with our neighbor police department and say, ‘Hey, so-and-so overdosed in our town today.’ So their outreach team can be activated,” says Allen., Rogers, of Plymouth Police, says he’s hoping that spending money on outreach now saves both money and lives down the line., “If someone is breaking into someone’s home, it’s probably due to some addiction they’re trying to feed,” Rogers says. “Quite frankly, if we can curb the addiction problem, we can probably reduce the crime problem.”, But when Sloane goes out, she’s not thinking about future crime rates. She’s thinking about saving lives., Sloane, who asked that her last name not be used, is a recovery coach at Baystate Community Services., She started doing drugs at age 13, and got clean in her 30s. Now, instead of running from police, she volunteers her time to go with them on visits to people who've recently overdosed.,  “I talked to them the same way I would talk to anybody,” Sloane says. “I kind of give them my story because I lived it, I did it.”, People are usually offered treatment services immediately after an overdose at the hospital, but, Sloane says, they're often too freaked out to accept. So, going by the next day and talking to them at home, where they're comfortable, can be more successful., Sloane says she wishes police and social services had more bandwidth to follow up again in a week or a month, but they don’t. So, she leaves her card and tells them to call any time., Judy and Dave McCarthy, who lost their daughter, say they’re glad that at least some officials are helping people get treatment., “I think that’s really good,” says Judy McCarthy., Dave agrees. “Everybody is clicking together now. I mean, it’s incredible.”, They’re not the only ones who have been impressed. Police departments and groups from across the state and the country have reached out to learn how to recreate Plymouth County’s model., But it is only a start. The McCarthy's say the whole system to heal people addicted to opioids is in need of healing itself., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"
563,[Worcester Firefighters Add A New Tool To Their Kit: Narcan],"[Firefighters carry a variety of tools that can help them save lives in emergencies. The latest addition to that kit: easy to administer doses of the anti-overdose drug Narcan., “It's amazing,” said Worcester Fire Department Chief Michael Lavoie. “In 2016, we had 737 incidents involving opiates, and we administered 241 doses of Narcan.” , It frequently falls on firefighters to administer the drug, because they’re usually the first on the scene in the case of emergency. , “The quicker you can get Narcan onboard a patient the better. Firefighters and fire departments are spread out strategically,” said Lavoie. “We can get there usually faster than both police and the EMS.”, Chief Lavoie says the frequent overdose calls can be difficult and dangerous. One of his firefighters got stuck by an addict’s needle as he was attempting to revive her. Some of new synthetics hitting the streets, like carfentanyl, are so potent that first responders can overdose themselves, just by touching them. In fact, Lavoie says, the firefighters have doubled the amount of Narcan they carry around, in case they ever need it themselves., Now the firefighters are being asked to do more., A few months ago, the city’s commissioner for Health and Human Services, Dr. Matilda Castiel, asked Lavoie how the fire department could participate more in outreach programs for addicts. She wondered if the fire station could become a place where addicts could go for a referral if they were looking for assistance., “I thought that could possibly work down the road,” said Lavoie, “but we needed first to educate our firefighters.”, That education started last month, led by the commissioner herself. Castiel is a physician with a background in emergency medicine, and during the training she delivered a lecture on the neuroscience of addiction as part of a session titled, ""Addiction — It's not a Choice, It's a Disease."", “I want people to understand that this is a disease that needs to be treated. If we take the stigma out of this then people will start talking more about it,” said Castille, between training classes with groups of firefighters. , She added that she was encouraged by what she heard from the firefighters during the sessions. “Five [or] 10 years ago you wouldn't see anybody raising their hands and saying, …  'You know somebody, my family or a friend of mine has [an opiate addiction],’” she said. “That wasn't even a topic that you talked about. The fact that that's even happening now, it's huge.”, At times though, the clinical approach clashed with what the firefighters say they experience in the streets.  , Lavoie regularly meets with each of his fire crews, and a few days after the training, I sat in as he debriefed with the firefighters of Engine 4, who serve the area of town where overdose calls are most frequent. Some of the firefighters pushed back on the notion that they needed to work at humanizing addicts in the context of their job., “To humanize the addict for the common Joe, that's fine,” says firefighter Ben Dio, but “to humanize the addict to the person that has to go to the addict four times a shift? You’re stripping away his armor. You're stripping away his ability to do a good job for the ten addicts he's gotta go to next week, because to humanize every addict, to humanize every patient means that we take on a little bit of that pain.  Because it does tear you apart, you can only go to so many broken homes so many times.”, As Dio went into more detail, it became clear why he didn’t need additional training to humanize drug addicts. , “My sister-in-law died from a heroin overdose. We were her foster family, took care of her growing up, and it was one of the hardest things,” he said. “She died on 60 days sober, moving into her sober house. She just had a bad day and pressure got to her. She relapsed and the relapse is what killed her. So, you know, this epidemic touches everybody on every level. It really does.”, Dio saids this wasn’t always the case. Before he was a firefighter, he worked as an EMT, and over the years he has witnessed a change, as synthetic opiates became more common., “When I first started EMS, the people you were getting for heroin would've been your street people, the stereotypical junkie,"" he said. ""And then you started seeing the oxycontin. Nobody was calling it opiate overdose. It was kids doing pills. “, Just as Dio tells me this, a call comes in for a possible OD., I jump in the engine with the crew, and we drive to the scene. There’s a car parked on the side of the street, with an unresponsive man slumped back in the driver’s seat. The track marks on his arms are visible 20 feet away. , The crew gently lifts the man out of the car, stretch him out on the asphalt, and check his vitals. He’s barely breathing. They set up oxygen, while one firefighter pumps a breathing bag. Another firefighter delivers a dose of narcan into the man’s nose., Not more than a couple of minutes later, the man sits up, awake and alert, as if he just woke up from a nap. Confused, he looks around at the crowd of first responders and onlookers, some of whom applaud. By then, EMTs have arrived with an ambulance, and the firefighters give them a debrief. They help the man to his feet. And though he couldn’t breathe on his own moments earlier, he walks himself into the back of the ambulance., And that’s it. The firefighters barely have their seat belts on before the next call comes in. This kind of scene is now part of their routine — sometimes a single crew can get several overdose calls in one shift., “You can get Narcan out to the people, and that's great because a little shot of Narcan can keep somebody alive one more day to try to get to the help they need,” said Dio. “But [there’s] just no good answer right now.”, In the meantime, Lavoie says overdose calls for the Worcester Fire Department are actually on track to be down in 2017, but it’s not a sign the addiction problem is getting better. He says among the factors causing this decrease are more cases of friends and family privately administering Narcan, and other addicts simply dying outright from the more powerful opiates that are now on the streets., Arun Rath is the host of WGBH News' All Things Considered. ]"

The Yankees accused the Red Sox of an elaborate scheme to figure out the signs Yankees' pitchers and catchers use to communicate to give Sox batters an advantage at the plate., Boston Globe Media Sports Columnist Chad Finn says scouting opposing teams' signs is a legal and widely-used practice across the league. What has the Red Sox in hot water is accusations that trainers used an Apple watch to tip off players at the plate about what pitch is coming next. Scouts notified trainers in the dugout through an Apple watch and the trainers relayed that information to players on the field. It's against league rules to use technology to scout other teams' signs., The Red Sox filed a counterclaim that Yankees used TV cameras to do the same. Finn says bringing technology to a method that used to require a keen eye and understanding of the game detracts from the sportsmanship of the practice., To hear the full conversation between Finn and Morning Edition's Joe Mathieu, click on the audio player above.]"

Among those at the rally were Massachusetts residents who had received DACA deferments., Elias Rosenfeld is an undocumented immigrant and advocate brought to the U.S. as a six-year-old from Venezuela who is attending Brandeis University. He says ending DACA will create extra fear of federal immigration officials for people like him., ""Because we're the only immigrant group now where they have our information,” Rosenfeld said. “They have our addresses, they know where we go to school, they know where we are employed."", Filipe Zanborlini is an activist who has a green card now but was granted a DACA deferral previously. He spoke emotionally to the crowd., , ""Because when our communities are under attack what do we do?” said Zanborlini. The crowd chanted back: ""stand up, fight back.""’ Then Zamborlini — his voice strained, yelling, the address system distorting — asked them again, ""Because when our communities are under attack, what do we do?”, The answering chant came back loud and strong., Several speakers at the rally called on Governor Charlie Baker to support making Massachusetts a so-called sanctuary state by supporting a bill filed in the state legislature that would limit state and local law enforcement's cooperation with federal immigration officials., Marjorie Decker is a state representative from Cambridge who spoke to the crowd. She said she was in tears at the news while driving to the rally., ""I am devastated. I am sad. I am depressed. But I need to be here with you, because now what I feel is determined — determined anger,” Decker said., Many speakers at the rally urged passage of a bill filed in the state legislature that would allow state universities to continue in-state tuition for undocumented students who have it because they're covered under DACA., On Tuesday, the presidents of the nine state universities called on House Speaker Robert DeLeo and Senate President Stanley Rosenberg to advance that legislation., Governor Charlie Baker issued a statement on Tuesday saying he hopes Congress will preserve the protections of DACA for Massachusetts residents who are now in the military, working in the state, or attending state schools.]"

567,[The Return of College Kids: A Lesson In Economics],"[Click here for a radio version of this story., For people in the moving industry, the end of summer is always a busy time. For Rio Francisco, it’s relentless., “I was here already at five o’clock this morning, I left last night at one in the morning,” said Francisco, the manager of the U-Haul rental store in Brighton. , Just before Labor Day, the line of customers stretched almost out the door. People carried cardboard moving boxes and keys to rented trucks and trailers. Francisco says in the last few weeks, he has rented thousands of U-Hauls., “I lost track,” said Francisco with a laugh. “This is the equivalent of Christmas time for regular stores.”, Like the holidays, there is something both frenzied and festive about the return of students. The city estimates that 16,000 college kids live in off-campus apartments where most of the leases are in sync with the school year. They end August 31 and start up again the next day. In the span of 48 hours, there are thousands of people wheeling suitcases down the sidewalk and trying to squeeze mattresses through front doors., “I would say chaos is the right term to use,” said Chris Taylor, as he took in the scene from outside his Commonwealth Avenue real estate office. “As you can see, it’s a bunch of trucks and moving vans and lots of traffic.”, Taylor manages 200 apartments and says the inconvenience is worth it, because students are a lynchpin in the city’s real estate market., “I sell investment properties as well, and I always tell my investors the best part about this area is that there’s so many universities,” explained Taylor. “If we have a recession, the market crashes, you always have that student market to kind of fall back on.”, Students mean big business for everything from mom-and-pop restaurants to corporate giants. Comcast, for instance, says when the students come back, the number of internet and cable installations in Boston jumps nearly 200 percent., At Basics Furniture in Allston, Neil Wigetman is in the middle of what for him is the equivalent of Black Friday. Between mid-August and mid-September, he’ll net up to forty percent of his annual profits. He stocks up on merchandise and brings in extra staff. Getting ready takes work, but given the constant parade of customers, making the sale is easy. , “Everybody comes and they point out the items they want. ‘I’ll take one of these’, a desk, a bureau, a mattress. Everyone wants the same stuff,” said Wigetman., Much of this economic boon is made possible by parents, like Jack Mudge, who drove down from New Hampshire to move his son from one apartment to another.  , “I’ve had two kids go to Wentworth in the last few years, and I’ve avoided this day every time, and today I’m down here,” said Mudge, as he took a break from loading furniture onto an already overloaded pickup truck and trailer. “This is a disaster area.”, Mudge motioned to a pile of cast-offs on the sidewalk. Kids moving from one apartment to the next leave behind tables, mattresses, art work -- things that someone else might use to furnish their apartment. It’s a tradition known as 'Allston Christmas.' Mudge points to something he picked up from a pile., “I have my new desk chair,” he says with a wry smile, “I had to get something out of it.”, Not everything gets recycled.  After the big weekend move, the city picked up 700 tons of trash. When the college kids come back, the Department of Public Works gets a boost in business, too.  , Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

575,[LISTEN: Mass. Juror Claims Racism During Deliberations In 30-Year-Old Murder Case],"[Barbara Howard: A juror who helped convict a man of first-degree murder, a conviction that sent him to prison for life more than 30 years ago, was back in court last week. This, after she came forward with claims of racial bias during deliberations. She spoke out in court on Friday and recounted what she says happened during those deliberations in the trial of Darrell Jones. He's a black man who was tried before an all-white jury. Jenifer McKim with WGBH News partner the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has been following this story. She came into the studio to talk about it. Hi Jenifer., Jenifer McKim: Hello., Barbara Howard: So, give us some background of the case and this man, Darrell Jones., Jenifer McKim: So Darrell Jones, who was 18 years old when he was arrested for the murder of a alleged drug dealer in a Brockton parking lot. And he was convicted a year later for this crime. Basically, not one eyewitness in the courtroom actually pointed to him in court and said he did it and there was no physical evidence, but he was convicted. Now years later, he's always maintained that he is innocent. He's filed his third motion to reopen this case, and it has brought up these interesting allegations of racial bias., Barbara Howard: So Jones had already been trying to get the case reopened when this juror, whose name is Eleanor Urbati — is that her name?, Jenifer McKim: Yes., Barbara Howard: She came forward with claims of bias during deliberations, right?, Jenifer McKim: Correct. So we at the New England Center for Investigative Reporting started investigating his innocence plea a couple of years ago, and as part of that investigation, we met Miss Urbati, who told us in an interview that she always regretted convicting Darrell Jones, that she was the last holdout juror in a hung jury and that she remembered that a juror had said that he thought that Darrell was guilty because he was black. She told us this. We printed it in our story, and it ended up coming to the attention of the judge who's considering this case., Barbara Howard: Now this juror, Eleanor Urbati, she was in court. What happened?, Jenifer McKim: So she testified in court that on the first day of deliberations more than 30 years ago, a juror said that Darrell Jones was guilty and she said ‘Why? Because he's black?’ and he [the juror] said ‘Yes.’ So she's always regretted that she didn't speak up in the past about this, and she's always regretted her decision to convict him. Here is a cut from her after the hearing., CLIP: OK. He's been in jail all this time, and I didn't think he did it. And I never should have changed my mind., Barbara Howard: What do the other jurors have to say?, Jenifer McKim: So the court reached out to all the jurors that they could — it's 30 years ago. A lot of people have moved, some people have died. They were able to reach out to some of them. They had a hearing a couple of weeks ago in which three jurors came and basically said I can't remember anything. I can't remember if it happened or not. So she is the only juror who has said that it's happened, and no one's really been able to either confirm or refute that., Barbara Howard: Now, it also sounds like regardless of bias in the jury, the evidence against Jones was not all that strong to begin with., Jenifer McKim: Definitely. There's a lot of questions that come in Darrel Jones case. The prosecutor at the time came up with no motive. There was no physical evidence. It was an eyewitness case and yet none of the eyewitnesses said in court this is the man who did it. And there is a really unusual videotape that was aired during the court hearing that had a mistake in it which was either —as Darrell calls — tampered with or the police said was just a mistake. So there's a lot of interesting things the judge is now going to be taking into consideration the allegations of racism as well as these other claims., Barbara Howard: Now I understand this juror who came forward, Eleanor Urbati, she had some interaction with Darrel Jones’ mother?, Jenifer McKim: It was very compelling. After the hearing, Darrell Jones’ mother Edna Sawyer who had come up from Virginia, she has been coming to all his court hearings, was out, as well as some of their other family, and basically Miss Urbati said, ‘I'm sorry’ and her [Darrell Jones] mom said, ‘Don't be.’ And she remembered them crying together after the conviction.You can hear this tape:, CLIP: And I said to my mom, ‘Why is she crying, like she a member of the family or something?’ And when you came in the bathroom, we was in there and you broke down. And when you broke down, you broke down. And me and you and my mom, we cried. I remember crying, I know that., Barbara Howard: Now Jennifer, you believe that this is the first time a Massachusetts jury has been reconvened like this one?, Jenifer McKim: Right. So this is all prompted by a March Supreme Court decision that is requiring trial judges to bring juries in if there are questions of bias. We understand this is the first time here in Massachusetts. What the next step is the judge will be determining whether or not to vacate his conviction and open it up again., Barbara Howard: OK, thanks for joining us Jenifer., Jenifer McKim: Thank you very much., Barbara Howard: That's Jenifer McKim of WGBH news partner The New England Center for Investigative Reporting. , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

That's the message at Greater Boston Labor Council's annual Labor Day breakfast Monday., Richard Rogers is the head of the Labor Council — the regional arm of the AFL-CIO. Rogers calls it a fallacy that President Trump is trying to help the working class., ""Nothing could be farther from the truth,” Rogers says. “He's actually deregulating the economy, and all these regulations that protect workers; he's appointing anti-union zealots to the National Labor Relations Board; and he's packed his cabinet with Wall Street people."", He also says that Trump has undermined the Occupational Safety and Health Administration., And Rogers says, in the last election, the union failed to convince enough members that Trump did not have their best interest at heart., ""It's an imperative now that we educate our members about Trump: what he does — not what he says, and not what he tweets — but what he does,” says Rogers., Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, and Attorney General Maura Healey are all scheduled to speak at the Labor Day breakfast in Boston. , Rogers says the Democratic party turned their backs on the working class during Obama's last term. And, he says, the union needs to remember that as they try to change the minds of members who voted Republican., ""I don't think they knew what they were going to get,” Rogers says, “but they were angry, and so, our role is to actually in terms of union members that voted for Trump, is to reason with them and educate them."", Rogers says collective bargaining and unions are essential to maintaining and expanding the middle class., Local Fast-food Workers Protest on Labor Day For $15 Minimum Wage, Some Massachusetts fast-food cooks and cashiers plan to walk off the job to join a nationwide Labor Day protest — they want to see the minimum wage increased to $15 an hour., Darius Cephas is a cook at a Chipotle's in Dedham; before that, he worked at a McDonalds., Cephas says he can't really make ends meet on the current minimum wage of $11 dollars an hour — and that he's always juggling bills as he struggles to support his family., ""No landlord in the world is going to really want to hear your sob story on why you can't afford your rent,” Cephas said. “They want their rent on time.”, If lawmakers fail to increase the state minimum wage, protesters are also backing two proposed ballot questions which would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour and guarantee workers paid family and medical leave.]"
577,"[Three decades later, juror tries to set record straight]","[More than 30 years after Eleanor Urbati, a white Hingham resident, reluctantly helped convict a 19-year-old black man of first-degree murder, she testified in court Friday that the deliberations were biased. , Urbati, 81, a former switchboard operator, told a Plymouth Superior Court judge that on the first day of deliberations in 1986, a juror told the all-white panel that he believed Darrell Jones was guilty of the Brockton murder because he was black. , Urbati, who was the last holdout to break a hung jury, testified that when the unnamed juror said Jones was guilty, she asked him why. , “I said, ‘Are you saying that because he is black?’ And he said, ‘Yes,’ ’’ Urbati said in court. “I was just kind of shocked.” , Justice Thomas McGuire Jr. summonsed Urbati to court as part of a reexamination of the Jones verdict, in what is believed to be the first such review in Massachusetts since the US Supreme Court ruled in March that a trial judge must pry into typically secret discussions if there is evidence of racial bias. Other members of the jury were questioned last month. , Urbati’s allegations were first aired in a 2016 investigation published by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting that examined Jones’s third motion to vacate the murder conviction without possibility of parole. , Jones says he’s innocent, alleging that police tampered with a videotaped interview of a key witness shown at his trial to remove exculpatory evidence. The tape is important because none of the eyewitnesses testified in court that they were sure Jones was the shooter. , Jones also says that his lawyer at the time, now deceased, failed to adequately represent him by, among other things, forcing him to sit in a so-called prisoner’s dock 10 feet behind him, rather than beside him. Prosecutors offered no motive or physical evidence to convict him, court records show. , McGuire said he first heard about the bias allegations in June and was required to call jurors back to court despite the decades that have passed. , The hearing was prompted by a Supreme Court decision involving a Colorado man, Miguel Angel Pena Rodriguez, who appealed his 2007 conviction for unlawful sexual contact after learning that a juror had said he thought Pena Rodriguez was guilty because he was Mexican, and “Mexican men take whatever they want.” State law has a similar requirement based on a 2010 ruling from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. , McGuire said court officials tried to reach all the jurors, but not all could be located or could make it to court. In early August, three others testified that they couldn’t remember whether bias was present in their deliberations. Too much time had passed, they said. , Urbati said she did not attend the first hearing because she hadn’t received a summons. On Friday, she said, she remembers when the juror allegedly admitted to racism in the jury room. She regrets not speaking up earlier and couldn’t say why she kept quiet — perhaps because she’d been instructed by the judge not to discuss jury deliberations or because she didn’t think it would make a difference, she said. , She testified Friday that the color of Jones’ skin didn’t come up again during jury deliberations. She said the same juror said later, “I’ll say anything just to get out of here.” , Jones’s attorney, John Barter, said Urbati’s testimony was credible and should convince the judge that Jones did not have an impartial jury. , Jessica Kenny, a Plymouth County assistant district attorney, said Urbati’s testimony isn’t enough to prove racial bias. Among her arguments, she said, it’s not clear the statements were made, because other jurors couldn’t confirm them. Even if they were uttered, she said, it’s unclear whether they were made sarcastically or humorously. It’s also possible, she said, that the jury “was simply commenting on the state of the evidence in the identification that had been made.” , McGuire said he would consider the testimony as part of Jones’s motion and make a determination at a later date. , Urbati has long regretted changing her vote to guilty in Jones’s trial, and she cried during his sentencing decades ago. “I feel terrible he has been in jail all this time,” she said. “I didn’t think he did it.” , After the hearing, Urbati greeted several of Jones’s family members in the hallway. Among them was Jones’s mother, Edna Sawyer, who had driven from her home in Virginia. The two hugged each other and remembered crying together in the bathroom after Jones’ conviction. , “I’m sorry,’’ Urbati said. , “Don’t be sorry,’’ said Sawyer. “The truth will come one day. And I love you, all right.” , This story was co-published with the Boston Globe., Jenifer B.

578,[Undocumented Immigrants Protected By DACA Await Trump Administration's Decision],"[BARBARA HOWARD: This is All Things Considered, I'm Barbara Howard. A decision on the fate of DACA is expected from President Trump on Tuesday. That's according to the White House. Tuesday is the day that a consortium of states had threatened to go to court to end the program once and for all. DACA, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, was put in place by President Obama five years ago. Renewable every two years, it offered a semblance of security to people who were brought by their parents to the U.S. as children, allowing them to work legally, to hold a driver's license, essentially, to have a future here. DACA kids had to have good standing, as well. Before DACA, there was the DREAM Act, a precursor to DACA. One of the so-called ""Dreamers"" is in the studio with me – Cairo Mendes, a lead organizer for what's called the Student Immigrant Movement. It's a statewide network of undocumented youth and supporters. Thanks for coming in, Cairo., CAIRO MENDES: Thank you, Barbara, for having me., HOWARD: So tell me what it was like ... what brought you to United States? Where did you come from? How old were you?, MENDES: Yeah, I came to the United States 15 years ago in 2002. I was 9 years old. My family and I came on a tourist visa and my dad had already been living here., HOWARD: So you came from Brazil to... ?, MENDES: Marlboro, Massachusetts, yeah., HOWARD: Tell me what it was like the first days, when you got to the United States., MENDES: On the way to the airport, from Logan Airport to Marlboro, my dad was very specific and he said we couldn't really share the situation. And it was very difficult being here in those first few days, being extremely, you know, alone and depressed and not knowing the language or the culture. , HOWARD: Yeah, that's hard for any immigrant, but being someone who couldn't say, ""I have no papers,"" was that a problem growing up?, MENDES: It didn't really become that much of a problem until I became the age of 16, when I couldn't apply for a driver's [license], when I couldn't get a job. You know, all my friends were thinking about college, and I necessarily didn't know if I was even going to be able to do that. , HOWARD: In 2010 the DREAM Act was in the news. It didn't become law, but that's when you revealed your status, right?, MENDES: That's right. In 2010 the DREAM Act was introduced. I was 17 at the time. So I decided that I would have to step out of the shadows and claim my status., HOWARD: And then two years later, 2012 – that was five years ago – comes DACA., MENDES: Yes. President Obama passed Deferred Action, which helped over 800,000 people apply for work permits and driver's licenses. , HOWARD: Well, at that time, ""come out of the shadows"" is what they said. Do you have any regrets now that you did that?, MENDES: I don't have any regrets. I think there's a lot of anxiety within the community that the government has all that information and that the Trump administration could use [it] to deport people, but a lot of us who are here are fighting and are saying that we are going to keep resisting this., HOWARD: Have you encountered people your age who have not stepped out of the shadows who are reluctant to do so at this point?, MENDES: Yes., HOWARD: What do they have to say for themselves?, MENDES: I think they're afraid, and rightfully so. You know, they're afraid for themselves, they're afraid for their families., HOWARD: Are you concerned that the list could be used to find the parents of these one-time children who were brought over?, MENDES: Yeah, yeah. I think I would, you know, I wouldn't want to hide that, I think that that's a real fear that's passing through a lot of people's heads., HOWARD: Are people taking actual action, going underground in some way?, MENDES: Yes. A lot of individuals that have gotten in contact with me are afraid to come out, are afraid to speak out., HOWARD: What kind of support are you getting from outside groups?, MENDES: We have received contact from legal service organizations that are here to protect students if anything happens to their families or themselves. And so, you know, we're getting a lot of support from a lot of different types of groups., HOWARD: Do you have any intention of getting in touch with the AG's office, Maura Healey's office, here in Massachusetts? They appear to have been considering getting involved to help people like you, DACA kids., MENDES: I think we're always open to working with the Attorney General's office, who has done amazing work already. And so, we're definitely always open to working with her on this. Yes. , HOWARD: What about you personally? Can you imagine living in Brazil?, MENDES: You know, I don't know. I don't think so. I have grown up here. You know, my family has lived here for so long that it really ... I don't see myself in Brazil. I wouldn't know [what] a life in Brazil could even look like, even though the rest of my family is there. , HOWARD: What about students who didn't find out about their status until much later in life?, MENDES: I've always known I was undocumented, but a lot of immigrant youth didn't find out they're undocumented until they were graduating high school. That whole time they thought they were U.S. citizens, and they came here when they were six months old. So to throw these kids to countries that they have no attachment to is cruel and it's inhumane., HOWARD: You said your whole family is in Brazil at this point, including your mother?, MENDES: When I said my whole family, I mean my extended family – my grandparents and my dad, right. My dad went back seven years ago. My stepmother is there. I have two younger siblings that are down there as well., HOWARD: Who in your family is still here?, MENDES: Just me, my mom and my sister. And, you know, some extended cousins. Yeah., HOWARD: If you went back to Brazil – I mean, people listening are thinking, ""Gee, he has an American education."" You've gone through the Massachusetts state college system. You would have no trouble finding a job. You wouldn't be poor if you went back to Brazil. You have the skills now., MENDES: Absolutely. I don't dispute that. And in all honesty, I've also thought about that, too, because my work permit expires in November of next year, and I graduate in May. And so to me, it's, you know, like, would I be able to find a job afterwards? You know, so even that real thought about going back and using my American education, that has definitely, no doubt about it, crossed my mind. And then there's the other side, that is like, actually, but you know, this is also a home and it took a long time to make it home. And also the way I see it, when I go back, is it letting them win? , HOWARD: Well, it also raises the question of, you know, the United States educated you through public schools and through public colleges and are we, essentially, financing training for people who then go abroad and don't use their skills here? I mean, is that ... it hurts us as a country as much as it helps Brazil?, MENDES: I personally think that it would hurt the U.S. to then go back to their homes and open businesses and pursue careers there to contribute to the economies. That is a loss of knowledge, that is a loss of skills that the U.S. is experiencing., HOWARD: Do you lose sleep over this? , MENDES: I have in the past week. There have been times where I've woken up in the middle of the night anxious, and that is something that is going on all across the board from what I hear from people who are involved in the immigrant rights movement. Every day there's rumors that this announcement is going to come out. So imagine us, who do this work, are not only the impacted group from this decision, but also having to guide and provide direction for the community. It's an added stress, and so, it is exactly what they want. They want us to wake up in the middle of the night. They want us to freak out. They want us to make rapid decisions based on emotions and feelings. , HOWARD: Are you finding people just leaving the country just to put it behind them?, MENDES: I saw a lot of people leave after the election. I haven't heard recently, but I know that throughout the year people have been leaving the country out of, I think, exhaustion – not seeing some sort of pathway to adjusting their status. And people just rightfully feeling afraid of this administration. , HOWARD: And you, yourself, have you entertained those thoughts of leaving?, MENDES: I have, I have. I think that at some point, you know, decisions have to be made and it just feels more like we're not wanted here., HOWARD: OK, thank you so much, Cairo., MENDES: Thank you so much for having me. I appreciate it., HOWARD: That's Cairo Mendes, lead organizer for what's called the Student Immigrant Movement, a statewide network of undocumented youth and supporters.

579,[New Hampshire Immigrant Mother Of 5 'Desperate' To Stay In The US],"[When Luciana Micaela Casiano Velez came to the United States from Uruguay with her parents under a visa waiver program, she was 11 years old. Now 27 and a mother of five American children, Casiano Velez is facing deportation by mid-September., The Hookset, New Hampshire resident told WGBH News that she was told last week that immigration officials informed her that she had to leave the country. The circumstances of her sudden order of deportation has the American Association of Immigration Lawyers up in arms. But upon further investigation, WGBH News found that this story is more nuanced. , According to Casiano Velez, she arrived at the Social Security office in Manchester, New Hampshire, for a scheduled appointment on Monday, Aug. 21 with all of her children. The oldest two are 9 and 5 years old. She also has 3-year-old twins and a 5-month-old baby. She was applying for assistance for her oldest, who suffers chronic asthma. His father — her ex — is disabled. Part of his Social Security benefits go to child support. The process seemed routine., They asked for her son’s information before a clerk asked her for more identification and disappeared behind closed doors, Casiano Velez said., “We waited there for about 20 minutes,” she said.  , Casiano Velez — kids in tow — then went into an office with Social Security officials. But something totally unexpected happened next., “We walked out, immigration was there,"" she said., Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents placed her in custody. Casiano Velez says they were waiting for her at the Social Security office. According to her lawyers, ICE demanded to know where in the U.S. her parents currently live. She said she told them that she didn’t know. After several hours in ICE custody, she was allowed to go home. ICE agents ordered her to return Aug. 28 with a passport and plane ticket to her native Uruguay. They also made her wear an electronic bracelet. That is when, she said, her 9-year-old son suffered an asthma attack. , “I had to bring him to the hospital. It was awful,"" Casiano Velez said. , ICE was not available to comment by WGBH News’ deadline for our radio story. Since then, agency spokesman Shawn Neudaurer sent a written statement alleging that “she presented false identification documents to Social Security administration officials,” a federal crime., , Undocumented since she was 11, Casiano Velez said she doesn't know how ICE officials knew she'd be at the Social Security office. But she did not disclose to WGBH News that ICE was alleging that the identification she used at the Social Security office was a fake green card., Social Security officials called ICE, which quickly determined that Casiano Velez has been in the country undocumented since 2002. But Susan Church, a Cambridge-based attorney and former head of the New England Chapter of The American Association of Immigration Lawyers, said Casiano Velez’s possible deportation to Uruguay, under the circumstances, still strikes her as egregious., “This is a woman with five U.S. citizen children, some who have serious health problems, who was applying for the lawful benefits that the law entitles her to,"" Church said. ""And it’s a deliberate attempt by this administration to scare people into the shadows, so that they never come out again.”, Casiano Velez’s attorney, Zoila Gomez, has filed for an adjustment of status for her client based on her marriage to a U.S. citizen and the hardship that would result in separating a mother from her children. She worries that her current husband, Rolando Casiano, an American citizen, would have to take care of all five kids on his own if she’s deported., ""I’m feeling nervous. I feel like if I leave, it’s going to be so shocking for my kids,"" Casiano Velez said. ""I don’t ... I don’t even know what to think anymore. I’m in a situation right now where I have to do whatever it takes for me to be here with my family. Like, I’m desperate right now. Like, every night I walk around my house, I go to my kids’ room and I look at my kids and I pray to God that they find a way that I can actually stay here for them."", Neudaurer said in the statement Casiano Velez “overstayed her lawful visit by 15 years.” But he also pointed out that she can still file a stay of deportation to try to work out this difficult situation. Casiano Velez — who sounds more like someone from Southie than from Uruguay — says she would not know what to do if deported. , ""I don’t know nothing about Uruguay,"" she said. ""See, I don’t have nobody there. My whole life was here. Like, my Spanish is OK, but it’s not a great Spanish either. There’s nothing for me in Uruguay. Nothing waits for me over there. My whole life is here."", Gomez has filed for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status for Casiano Velez, whose arrival to the U.S. in 2002 qualifies her for the program. She has not completed high school, but is now enrolled in a GED program. She is protected from deportation while her application is pending, and, at least by law, should be allowed to remain in the country if granted protections under DACA.   , Editor’s note: This article was posted after WGBH News received a statement from ICE officials about the status of Casiano Velez’s case., Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

584,[State And City Officials Watch Houston And Consider How We'd Evacuate Here],"[Seeing footage of families being evacuated from Houston neighborhoods by boat makes it hard not to wonder: What if it happened here? Could people be evacuated in time? City and state officials are looking at Texas and asking those same questions., Boston Mayor Marty Walsh says there’s no question what we’d have to do if it happened here., “If a storm like that hit Boston or Superstorm Sandy hit Boston — Harvey, Sandy whichever one it is — you have to evacuate,"" he said. ""Evacuate the city.”  , And it’s a scary thing to picture., “How do you get the North End evacuated? How do you get South Boston evacuated? How do you evacuate East Boston, parts of Dorchester with the Neponset River?” Walsh asked., “We've been continuously updating our evacuation plans,” said Austin Blackmon, the city's chief of environment, energy and open space. He said Boston is working with state and national authorities to develop the plan. “So, making sure that we understand what our transportation and evacuation routes are, how we need to have those staffed, how we make sure that we get people out of danger,” he said., One focus would be to reach the city’s most vulnerable residents, according to the city’s chief resilience officer, Dr. Atyia Martin. “So when you think about communications, you’re also thinking about folks who are immigrants who don’t speak English or don’t speak English well,"" she said. ""Or people who might have other ... trust issues with government and receiving information.”, And of course it’s not just Boston that may need evacuation. “We have, you know, 70-plus coastal communities, and every one of them has areas that are susceptible to life-threatening storm surge,” said Kurt Schwartz, director of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA)., “The key to a successful evacuation in advance of a hurricane is calling for the evacuation sufficiently in advance of the arrival of the storm,” he said. That’s probably the trickiest part of ordering an evacuation — officials would need to make that call before they could even be sure if the storm was really going to hit the area. They’ve created maps ranking the spots most likely to flood, to prioritize those evacuation orders., You can find them online here at MEMA’s website. Around Boston, the red parts of the map, which are most vulnerable, include Chelsea, East Boston, Winthrop, Dorchester, Quincy and Medford. And pretty much the whole coasts of the North and South Shores are red, as well as the coasts on both sides of Cape Cod., , “If you live in a coastal community or in a community that has waterways that open up to the ocean, you need to know whether you live in a hurricane evacuation zone,” he said., Schwartz says it’s essential that people in those zones have a plan, and have enough food and supplies to keep going for at least three days., As for evacuating by car, it could be a challenge in a state where there’s gridlock traffic under the best of circumstances, and very unclear evacuation route signage. Schwartz acknowledged the difficulty, but said police would be at traffic points along the evacuation route to help keep cars moving., But a lot of people don’t have cars. What about them?, “The city will designate places where people may walk to and get on buses and be transported by buses to reception centers and then on to shelters,” Schwartz said., The state’s hurricane evacuation plan is based on a scenario of coastal flooding. But Schwartz points out that’s not what happened in Houston. There, the storm just parked itself over the area, and it’s the rain that was the problem., “There is little doubt that if we had a storm system that dumped 20, 40, 50 inches of rain in Massachusetts, we would have widespread massive flooding just like Texas is experiencing,” he said. And with that, he says, we’d have all the same challenges they’re seeing in Houston., “Even if we had evacuated people out of the coastal evacuation zones, the flooding in other areas would be massive, destructive and life-threatening,” he said., Schwartz said the state does have plans for inland flooding, but up to now, they haven’t planned for a storm that dumps 50 inches of rain on our region. In fact, he doesn’t think anyone in the country planned for something like that. Now, he says, officials may have to rethink what he calls the ""thresholds"" of the state’s emergency evacuation plan. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

One official on Cape Cod even floated the idea of capturing and killing all great whites swimming near beaches, though he has since backed off the plan. , Brian Skerry, a resident shark expert, author, and National Geographic photographer joined Adam Reilly to discuss whether people should be worried about sharks or if they should be worried about us., Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"

588,[A Dorchester Phone Repair Shop Outsmarts Apple And Other Tech Giants],"[The storefront isn't much to look at., In fact, it isn’t entirely clear from looking through the big windows facing Dorchester Avenue, in the Field’s Corner neighborhood, what the business is., The only advertising is an inauspicious plastic sandwich board reading “Repair Service: From $30 and Under 30 Minutes, Walk-in Welcome.”, Inside is a large, room, with electronic equipment stacked in bins along the wall and lying in piles around the floor, and a few guys hunched over cheap plastic tables.,  But what they’re doing is as much a fine craft as it is hi-tech. , They’re fixing cell phones., These guys don’t work for Apple or Samsung, or any manufacturers. That’s the whole point.  , “I’m not officially sanctioned by the manufacturer,” explains Quang Le, who, with his friend and business partner Minh Phan, started this scrappy repair shop in 2015., The shop, says Le, “exists because there’s a need, and they don’t satisfy it.”, By “they,” Le means the big companies, like Samsung and Apple, who actually make and sell the phones., And the need he’s talking about is ubiquitous: cracked smartphone screens., Samsung screens can cost hundreds of dollars to replace. iPhone screens can cost an Apple customer around $150. Or, customers can get free repairs – if they pay for expensive insurance or special coverage plans, which often end up costing as much or more as repairs., And, Le says, the big companies can be ruthless about what “qualifies” for repair., “Like with Apple the phone has to be perfectly fine, the frame has to be perfectly fine. Sometimes it dropped really hard and it got dented – Apple won’t fix that,” Le says., “When they come to my store it’s like 80 bucks … Wouldn’t you rather go to the store down the block? We do it in like five minutes!”, Born in Vietnam, Le came to the United States as a foreign student when he was sixteen. He went to high school in California before moving here to attend Boston University., He was business major – but dropped out, because he had a business idea: one that gets to the very heart of that ubiquitous cracked screen problem., Where most of us see broken glass, Quang saw opportunity., And it’s one that other local phone repair gurus know very well., Curt Ingram, also known as “iPhone Curt,” explains, “When you drop your phone and break it, it’s typically the surface glass that breaks – the $3 part."", Ingram’s start was as scrappy as Le’s., “I placed an ad in Craigslist – I wasn’t prepared for people to actually call and need the service, so I was meeting people in parking lots, going over to their homes to fix their phones,” Ingram recalls., He eventually got a storefront and has a steady business fixing phones and computers. And he sees plenty of cracked iPhone screens., But even though it’s usually only the surface glass – the cheap part – that’s broken, his team can only do so much – because that inexpensive glass is carefully glued to the expensive components – the ‘digitizer’ and ‘LCD’ underneath the glass., “It’s a lot of labor to separate that from the digitizer and glue it back on properly, so it works well,” Ingram says. “We don’t do that, because it’s a lot of work.”, In other words, when it comes to this kind of repair, even iPhone Curt can’t really fix it – he has to swap the part out with a new or refurbished one. Apple doesn’t sell its parts., And so, Ingram says, “The challenge is to get good quality parts.”, That’s where Quang Le and his big idea come in., Le realized that by teaching himself this one, super-difficult skill: separating the broken glass from working screens  – he could get an edge – and make money. , He and his partner Phan hired some friends. They bought heavy-duty glue-warming tables from China. They built a dust-proof chamber out of metal. And they taught themselves by watching Youtube videos – and by trial and error. , “Like, we broke so many screens – like we broke probably hundreds of them, trying to do it,” Le chuckles., After a while, they got the hang of it. On an average day the team might refurbish more than a hundred screens., In a market flooded with unreliable knockoff parts, coming mostly from China, Le – now a permanent legal resident – is supplying high-quality parts refurbished right here in the United States., It’s a classic story – but why stop there?, As Le is closing up one afternoon, he mentions he’s considering going to law school next. Why? It turns out that’s part of another ambition of his., Le recalls announcing this ambition to his parents., “I can remember the day I called my mom,” he says. “I said, I want to be Prime Minister, just like that., Prime Minister, that is, of Vietnam.  , If he can, as he proudly claims, fix an iPhone better than Apple  – why not see if he can’t improve his home country?, Le isn’t naïve about the likelihood of this plan coming to fruition – “It’s kind of a pipe dream,” he admits., But he’s also not kidding: the ambition is real and he’ll likely pursue it until or unless he sees some reason not to., Quang Le, after all, isn’t afraid of broken glass – or of shattering expectations. , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
589,"[From 'Beantown' To 'The Hub,' How Did Boston Earn Its Nicknames? ]","[Here at the Curiosity Desk, we love nothing more than when we hear from you. Today we turn to Greg Rossolimo from Pomfret, Connecticut, who reached out with this question., ""Walking through Logan Airport I heard a recording of Mayor Walsh referring to Boston as the 'Hub of the Universe.' That nickname’s been around for a while, Boston as 'The Hub.' I was wondering about the origins of that expression — is it really Boston as the 'Hub of the Universe?'"", I took Greg’s question with me to Boston’s hub of history, the Massachusetts Historical Society, where librarian Peter Drummy explained that I was in luck. , ""Usually these things are folk names, so they just rise up without any origin point,"" he said. ""But this one? Date, place, author all laid out for us."", , The date: 1858. The place: The Atlantic Monthly. The author: Oliver Wendell Holmes, who coined the phrase in a series of essays called “The Autocrat at the Breakfast Table.” , In one of the essays, Holmes wrote, ""Boston State-House is the hub of the solar system. You couldn't pry that out of a Boston man, if you had the tire of all creation straightened out for a crowbar."", Drummy says the notion of the State House as the hub of the solar system quickly graduated to the city of Boston as the hub of the whole universe. The written record suggests that phrase was adopted quickly and widely. But there is a small catch: Holmes was a satirist. , ""He’s actually making fun of the fact that Bostonians are so full of themselves,"" said Drummy., But Bostonians have a long tradition of transforming others’ judgments into sources of pride. Take ""Puritans"" and ""Yankees"" — these were both originally pejorative terms, embraced by all. And that Bostonians accepted such an arguably arrogant nickname on its face is also very ... well ... Bostonian, says Suffolk University history professor Robert Allison. , ""We’ve always had, I think, an exaggerated sense of our own importance, and others can give us nicknames and we know it’s usually out of envy,"" he said., Case in point, another Boston nickname that predates “The Hub,” and is still heard bandied about today: ""The Athens of America."" Peter Drummy says that the term became popular in the early to mid-1800s, when interest in classical Greece was at its zenith around here. And Allison notes that it emerged just as Boston — once so indispensable to the very idea of America — was losing ground, and commercial influence, to other cities. , ""Athens is Socrates, and Plato, and Greek Philosophy,"" he said. ""Not the vulgar capitalism you see emerging in New York or Philadelphia or other places."", And if Ancient Greece isn’t a sufficiently grandiose source for a nickname, how about the word of God himself? Well, God as interpreted by Puritan minister John Winthrop, who called Boston the ""City Upon a Hill,"" just as the Massachusetts experiment was getting underway. , ""The city on the hill was going to be a model for building a society,"" said Drummy. ""The new Jerusalem."", It’s not clear whether that phrase was ever in common use, at least until the 1960s when John F. Kennedy referenced it in a famous speech before the Massachusetts legislature after he was elected president. Ronald Reagan picked up on it, added the word “shining,” and also use the term to great effect in the 1980s, as a metaphor for the whole of America. , ""So we’ve kind of embraced that,"" said Allison. ""The City Upon a Hill, and the eyes of all people are upon us. For Winthrop, [this] is really a warning, but for us is like, 'Oh yeah, everyone is watching us ‘cause they wanna figure out what they should do next.'"", Of course, one of Boston’s most enduring nicknames is easily its most humble — emerging perhaps in the 18th century, and popular by the early 19th century – when the city was flush with molasses from sugar trade with the West Indies, and had a penchant for slow cooking beans in the sugary goop. , ""Beantown is used widely today and has been for a long time,"" said Drummy., It may be cliché these days, but “Beantown,” in a single word, captures many aspects of Boston’s long history. From its infant years..., ""Cooking beans, which were the Natives' gift to the world, in molasses, which was the great commodity of the 18th century,"" noted Allison., To the notion of New Englanders as a thrifty, frugal people..., ""It’s one of the least expensive sources of protein that you can have,"" said Allison., From Boston as a sports town... , ""Boston had the early National League team, the Beaneaters,"" said Drummy. , To the waves of immigrants that would transform the city in the 19th and 20th centuries. , ""Italians, Portuguese, Chinese, they would all eat baked beans,"" said Allison., Still, I’ve yet to ever hear an actual Bostonian call their city ""Beantown."" It’s those more high-minded, aspirational nicknames that seem to hold sway around here. And that is A-OK with Robert Allison. , ""We have this idea of ourselves as being not only better than everyone else, [but] also better than we really are,"" he said. ""And it probably is a good thing to aspire to. I don’t want us to lose sight that we can be better than we are."", And hey, when you’re just a small city on a hill of beans punching above your weight as the ""Hub of the Universe,"" why not dream big? , Our thanks to Greg Rossolimo for his question that led to today’s story.

It's his fourth time helping flood victims in the past few years. Mark is on the line with us now from a shelter in San Antonio, where some of those fleeing the Houston area have sought help. Welcome, Mark., Mark Cook: Good afternoon, Mark. How are you?, Herz: Good, good. So you just started your 14-day deployment – what are you seeing? What are you hearing?, Cook: Right now, we're waiting on about 156 buses to bring in folks from Houston down here to San Antonio for shelter., Herz: What do people need most when they show up at the shelter you're at?, Cook: A lot of the folks that are here right now are asking for clothing., Herz: What's the hardest thing for people right now when they arrive at the shelter? What are you finding?, Cook: Being away from other family members and being away from their pets., Herz: And so who's in the shelter – families?, Cook: We have several families here now and we probably have about 40 individuals. And that's expected to change during the day today. They're expecting to fill this 2,800-bed shelter within the next 24 hours., Herz: And how long will most people be in the shelter?

There are highway signs giving directions to all the shelters. Once they get here, what they'll do is they'll register, they'll be assigned to a place where they are going to sleep – the men and women sleep separately.

When they get here ... they'll be assigned a bed, they'll get a blanket, they'll get some hygiene items, they'll get a pillow, and they'll set up their family the best they can here., Herz: Why do this? Why go into maybe even a dangerous or a stressful situation?, Cook: Well, because they need the help. They need the help. There's no way that the agencies down here alone can handle this this type of disaster. They need the support of the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and other places. And I do it because they need the help, and because it's just another way to make a difference in this world – you know, that's the only reason I do this. It's all about loving and caring for your brothers and sisters. I mean, we're all brothers and sisters ... no matter what., Herz: When you say that, when you talk about the kind of comfort you give people and the connection you're making with people, I mean, it's more than just feeding people and trying to see to their physical needs. I guess there's a special connection there?, Cook: There is a special connection, and we want to make sure that everybody that comes in gets the things that they need, whether it be medical care, mental health services, whatever it is they need.

598,"[BC High's First Woman President Talks Single-Sex Education, Diversity]","[Barbara Howard: This is All Things Considered, I’m Barbara Howard. For the first time in its 154-year history, the all-boys Boston College High School has chosen a woman, Grace Cotter Regan, as president. She replaces William Comesa, who is retiring. For five years, Cotter Regan has been head of school at St. Mary's, a coed middle and high school in Lynn, and she has earlier administrative experience in the nonprofit sector. She was both an undergraduate and a graduate student at Boston College. Cotter Regan joins us in the studio. Thanks for coming in., Grace Cotter Regan: Thank you for having me., BH: Your last name, Cotter, will be familiar to many alumni of Boston College High School. Your father, Jim Cotter, he was a football coach and athletic director at the school for what, about 40 years? Is that about right?, GCR: Forty one years., BH: OK. Well, we spoke with alumnus Tom Kenza of Newton. He played football for your dad and he says that while your credentials do speak for themselves, it sure doesn't hurt to be a Cotter., (Tom Kenza on tape), Tom Kenza: “Her family legacy is going to make anyone who doesn't know her or maybe might not have been as open to a woman … because the fact that she's Jim Cotter’s daughter, I think everyone's going to trust her believe that she has BC High in her blood and will do the right thing for it.”, BH: And your father, of course, is not the only connection you have to Boston College High School. Your father in law was a student there. Your son, also?, GCR: Bartley, he graduated in 2012., BH: OK, so given all these connections, are you at all worried about the alumni? Because quite a few alumni and some parents last spring were very outspoken against a proposal that was later scrapped to admit girls to this all-boys school, Boston College High School. Are you worried about that at all?, GCR: No, I'm actually not. I have a long, storied history with BC High. I literally was born the day my father started there in academics, Sept. 8 1960. So I have had 57 — close to 57 years of relationships with alumni, parents and friends. And I think we have credibility in our history and our legacy there. And my dad was very open about the school in the mission and I'm really committed to the mission of single-sex education at BC High. And that's what the board wants right now., BH: The idea of admitting girls was floated as a possible answer to steeply declining enrollments according to the Boston Globe. BC High expected 280 new students this fall. Last fall the number was 336. So without going coed, how do you plan to deal with these kinds of declines?, GCR: Well, it's interesting. As a leader of a Catholic school in Lynn right now, we have exactly the same conversations at the board level. How do you keep a school in Lynn or Dorchester relevant? What's the draw to a Catholic or a Jesuit Catholic education? And I think all of the schools have to ask those questions, and you'd be irresponsible not to ask what does BC High or St. Mary's Lynn look like in 2025., BH: Cardinal O'Malley reportedly was said to have been worried about going coed at B.C. High School, worrying about what it would do to the Catholic all-girls schools in the area. What do you think?, GCR: Well, I think he's right to worry on the one hand, but I do think the conversation is not around coed. I think it's around collaboration. So I think in a collaborative spirit, all of the schools are going to have some conversations over the next few years, because not everyone is going to survive and a lot of schools are struggling with economic issues. So I think no matter what, there's a bigger conversation, I think, in the archdiocese around what does Catholic education look like for Boston and for the Archdiocese of Boston., BH: Well, after the pushback from alumni and from many of the parents, the idea of going coed was quickly abandoned and there were lots of resignations, then, on the board — including the president, John McQuillan, who had floated the original idea. Now the board — it once numbered about three dozen people, and looking at your web site, it looks like it's fewer than a dozen today. Is that a problem?, GCR: While that happened, I think it's going to be a really good thing for BC High, and I will tell you, as someone who's in the field, many schools looked at that and kind of stepped back and looked at their own governance. So actually, I think it's going to be a good thing., BH: Well, have you had any chance to reach out to any of the board members who resigned or, of course, Mr. McQuillan, who had floated this idea of making it coed to try to mend the rift? I think there were some sore feelings., GCR: There are a lot of people who are — just need to be heard. I think people kind of got divided, and in my mind, they lost sight of the mission. And that's not a criticism, but I think when you get passionate about something, sometimes you can lose sight of the real work at BC High. And I think that's one of my gifts, I think I can bring people back to the table and have those hard conversations. We may agree to disagree, but it's going to be exciting., BH: Well the school you're leaving, St. Mary's of Lynn, is coed. I'd love to hear your thoughts on coed versus single-sex education, because you're going now to an all-boys school., GCR: Well it's interesting, you know, I'm a product of single-sex education. I went to Notre Dame Academy in Hingham. Both of my boys are single-sex educated, they went to BC High and St. Sebastian’s, and my husband went to Catholic Memorial, so we’re all single-sex education folks. Working at a coed school, I see the benefits of both. I love the single-sex model, I really do. I have loved my experience at St. Mary's. All of the models have their own set of complications with students, and I actually have experienced the beauty as a parent of a BC High education. I think my son really developed as a young man, and I really value what we have at BC High., BH: So you don't see yourself revisiting the question of going coed?, GCR: I would say that's a board decision, but I think we're committed right now — I know we're committed — to being a single-sex education opportunity for students, for young men in the city of Boston the greater surrounding area., BH: Given the alumni backlash against admitting girls, do you have any concerns about being the first woman to head Boston College High School from the alumni, or the parents or the students?, GCR: I think that there will be, or there has been, a little bit, a perception of ‘It’s a woman. She's going to take it coed.’ That is not the intention. I think I'm a great leader and my leadership is collaborative. It's distributive. I listen to people from an alumni perspective. I don't think being a woman is going to be a problem. I mean, I've had a very successful career in very difficult conversations, in difficult roles, being often a change agent. Not that I'm planning to be a change agent at BC High, but I will continue the conversation about what does BC High look like in 10 or 15 years., BH: And that could mean coed, you’d entertain that if it came up?, GCR: If the board and the school, with the right model, decided that's the way to go, then, of course, I mean whether you're a university or high school, you're going to have those conversations. But for the time being, we're a single-sex boy’s school., BH: There's been criticism of lack of diversity among the board of trustees, and looking at the web page, to my eye, it looks like it's mainly white males. Is that a problem?, GCR: I think it's an opportunity. So I think that that will be a priority for me and for the board to look at who we need in terms of talents, that we should reflect the diversity of our school, which is important to us, and to add some women and persons of color. I think that's critical., BH: OK, thank you for coming in., GCR: Thank you for having me., BH: That's Grace Cotter Regan of West Roxbury, named as the first woman president in the history of Boston College High School, which is 154 years-old.

600,[New Balance Wins Trademark Infringement Case That Could Set A Precendent],"[Since Boston-based shoemaker New Balance introduced their shoes to customers in China, they've been struggling to fight off local copycats. Three Chinese shoemakers who have been manufacturing counterfeits with the brand's signature tilted ""N"" logo have been protected under China's trademark law -- until now., Those three shoemakers owe New Balance $1.5 million in damages and legal costs -- a win lawyers are calling the largest trademark infringement award ever granted to a foreign business in China., Professor Leah Chan Grinvald, an international intellectual property law professor at Suffolk Law School in Boston, says that while this case may be perceived as precedent-setting, Chinese courts don't see it that way. , ""One of the unique things about Chinese courts that is different from U.S. courts, is that they don't follow precedent. So when we say precedent-setting, it is really up to other courts in China to decide whether or not they actually want to follow that precedent."", , China is home to a large percentage of U.S. manufacturing, and its history of intellectual property theft there is a long one. But Grinvald says it's a little more nuanced than a pure counterfeit offense., ""Copycats are a little bit different than counterfeit, in that they try to evoke the same product and properly evoke the logo, but they're not using the actual logo,"" says Grinvald. , That's the case with three defendants in this lawsuit, one of which is named ""New Boom""; it sounds similar to New Balance but it wouldn't be identified as counterfeit., So how was New Balance able to pull off a victory? Grinvald says they took a strategic approach: choosing China's broader anti-unfair competition law instead of the narrow trademark law. Trademark law works a little differently in China. Unlike in the U.S., Grinvald explains, rights for a trademark are granted to whomever files first. , Will other companies follow in New Balance's footsteps? Maybe. But Grinvald says they'll be careful when considering whether it's worth it., ""The one thing that other American and other foreign companies need to take into account is the cost that this kind of lawsuit takes"" she says. , New Balance invested a lot of time and money into this lawsuit -- time that could have been invested in their business. , WGBH News did not receive a response seeking comment from New Balance's senior counsel for intellectual property , Click on the audio link above to listen to the entire conversation between WGBH's Morning Edition Host Joe Mathieu and Leah Chan Grinvald, professor at Suffolk Law School in Boston., Ciku Theuri is a former Associate Producer for WGBH’s Morning Edition.]"
601,[Mayor's 'Mural Crew' Deploys Young Artists To Beautify Boston],"[A black pickup truck cruises through the intersection of Hyde Park Avenue and Cummins Highway in Roslindale honking its horn wildly — but it's not because of the traffic. As he passes, the driver sticks an enthusiastic thumbs-up out the side window, where a group of student artists is perched on ladders or on scaffolding working on a big, bright mural across the side of Atlas Liquors., This happens a lot when the Mayor's Mural Crew is out working. Now in its 26th year, this summer jobs program run by the City of Boston sends young students from the area — this year, almost twenty of them — to paint public art all around the city., They've completed five murals in just six weeks this summer, among them a tranquil forest of birch trees and a larger-than-life bodega cat in Roslindale and a retro-inspired abstract design on the side of the Whole Foods in Jamaica Plain. They also worked on two as part of a series called ""To Immigrants With Love,"" which features images of immigrants from the past alongside ones from the present day., This one depicts the founders of Atlas Liquors, Louis and Beatrice White, who immigrated to the United States from Russia in the early 1900s. Their grandson still runs the store. On the other side is Alex Castillo, who immigrated in 1996 from the Dominican Republic and started a tech company called Digitech Electronic Solutions a little ways down the street. The message ""You will always be welcome in the city of Boston"" is written in English, Spanish, Yiddish and Haitian Creole., , ""We really wanted to give the immigrant community in Boston a voice and a very permanent, prominent voice,"" says Katherine Copeland, the Immigrant Public Art Coordinator for the Mayor's Office For Immigrant Advancement, who today is working side-by-side with the students. ""We wanted to juxtapose how people have been contributing from as early as 1917 to the current day, now."", The project has special significance to many of the artists, too., ""A lot of my neighbors are immigrants, people from Haiti and Greece and all different parts of the world,"" says Christina Karos, a Roslindale resident and Boston Latin School graduate who now attends Temple University. ""You see all the news, all these things going on. Then seeing ‘you’ll always be welcome in the city of Boston’ makes me feel like we’re doing something good here for my community in Roslindale.”, , Artist Heidi Schork has been leading the Mural Crew since its inception 26 years ago. As the crew works, she keeps a watchful eye on their progress — reminding them to trust their instincts and making sure they step back and look at the big picture once in a while. , ""When they’re going to sign up, we warn them: It’s really hard work,"" she says. ""It’s hot. It’s dirty. You’re going to be moving all around the city. You’re under pressure. You’re going to be on ladders."", On top of that, it can be terrifying. For many students, it's their first time working on art of this scale. For some, it may even be their first time working extensively with art supplies at all. ""To do big art takes a lot of nerve,"" Schork explains., ""If you’re an adolescent, the worst thing in the world to do is mess up, in front of everybody, in front of kids you don’t know. That stops everybody in their tracks,"" Schork says. ""To build up confidence in order to take a risk and make a mistake is, every single day, a new challenge."", , Schork likes to remind them that it's only paint — the worst thing that can happen is you have to paint over it. That attitude comes in handy on Mural Crew, which sometimes pushes students out of their comfort zones. Artist Valencia Louis, a 15-year old student at the John D. O'Bryant School, points toward the six-foot high scaffolding artists are using to paint the faces of Louis and Beatrice White. ""When I first came here, I couldn't even get on that. I had a fear of falling down,"" she says. But now? ""I know how to get up there with or without the ladder."", Before this mural, the artists finished another project in East Boston as part of the ""To Immigrants With Love"" series. For many of the artists, it was their first time visiting that part of the city. , ""After we'd finish for the day, we'd go to the harbor and talk to each other and hang out,"" says Jonathan Monterovidal, a rising senior at Match Charter. ""We were just talking about going to the beach today after this. I feel like this job has brought us together. ... [We've] made new friends."", , Schork has seen that, too., ""They're free, it's summer, they're outside,"" she says. ""I don’t want to say it’s like 'Lord of the Flies,’ but they’ve created their own tribal mural crew identity group, which has a lot of freedom in it to be who you really are, to say what you really want to say."", To see more photos from the Mural Crew, check out the slideshow below., ,  , Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

603,[Chicopee Woman Wins Second Biggest Lottery Payout In North American History],"[A longtime hospital employee in western Massachusetts quit her job Thursday morning. And while that’s not something that normally makes headlines, her reason for quitting was newsworthy. This woman won a lottery jackpot worth nearly three quarters of a billion dollars., Mavis Wanczyk of Chicopee was leaving her job at Mercy Medical Center Wednesday night with her friend Rob, a firefighter, who suggested they check the winning numbers of the big Powerball lottery. Wanczyk had bought a ticket that afternoon., “And I went, ‘It's never going to be me. It's just a pipe dream I've always had,'"" she said. But then the numbers he started reading sounded familiar. ""And I go ‘I have that! I have that number! I have that!' And he goes, ‘Let me see that ticket, because you just won!’"", Wancyzk didn't believe him. ""He says, ‘Sign that ticket now,’” she remembered., The shock was so intense she wasn’t sure she’d make it home, so her friend followed her to make sure she got there safely., Wanczyk has worked in a clerical job in the nursing department of the hospital for 32 years., “I'm not going to say I'm the richest person in the world. I can't say I'm the poorest person in the world,"" she said. ""I make do with what I have.”, Now she’ll be making do with considerably more. Wanczyk took the lump sum option, and after taxes she'll take home more than $336 million. The lottery says this is the second largest lottery jackpot ever in North America., Wanczyk said she was hoping to retire from the hospital in 12 years, but her scheduled has now changed. “I’ve called them and told them I will not be coming back,” she said with a laugh., Oftentimes, big lottery winners take a while to come forward, and might never speak to the press. But the 53-year-old drove to the lottery headquarters in Braintree Thursday morning and spoke to the press with her mother and sisters at her side, as she chewed gum., “I just wanted to do this,"" she said. ""I want to just get over, done with. And then everybody would just leave me alone.”, There was a bit of a mix-up Thursday morning, as the Massachusetts Lottery announced the wrong store, one in Watertown, as the seller of the ticket. The actual seller will get $50,000, which he says will be given to local charities. The state and local governments are also getting some money out of this deal. State treasurer Deb Goldbeg said about $24 million of income tax will go to the state., “Tax revenues have been pretty lean as of late,"" Goldberg said. ""And so this is an added bonus that will benefit everyone in the state. In addition to that, as the Powerball was rising, it generated a lot of sales."" And that revenue is sent to cities and towns., “The profits of the lottery go back in unrestricted funds to every community,"" Goldberg added. ""It's the crossing guard. It's the extra shoveling that needs to be done.”, Goldberg said she had some advice for Wanczyk and her family, as they face their own windfall. “I highly encouraged them to first find a very, very good lawyer and advisor. And to think about very carefully how they'll manage those assets,” she said., Wanczyk will likely get to that point, but for now, she says she has other plans., “I'm going to go hide in my bed,” she said., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

605,[Large Nonprofits Contribute Less Than City's PILOT Request – Again],"[Boston nonprofits contributed about $17 million less than requested by the City last year as part of a program meant to encourage large institutions to voluntarily help make up for some of the hundreds of millions in annual revenue the city would realize if those institutions paid property taxes., The program, known as “Payment in Lieu of Taxes” or PILOT for short, has been in place for over a decade., But despite efforts to revamp the PILOT program in 2011 and 2012 – including a more aggressive approach to accounting for increasing property values -- the program raises only slightly more for the city than it did in those years.  , And even as Boston is booming, nonprofits seem less, not more willing to meet the city’s requests: While the overall contribution from these nonprofits was slightly higher than the year before, it was less, relative to the city’s request, than in 2016., The city can’t force any of these nonprofits to help make up the gap. They are exempt under state law., In a city like Boston, that means a lot of property – and a lot of extremely valuable property – goes untaxed, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars (if not more) in unrealized revenue every year.    , The city can, however, ask -- and every year it does., The 49 nonprofits that participated in Boston’s PILOT program – a list which includes Harvard, Boston University, Northeastern, Boston College as well as a host of hospitals and cultural institutions – did contribute a combined $32.4 million in voluntary payments to the city in Fiscal 2017., That’s about one percent more than the previous year – but it’s a proportionately smaller contribution compared to what the city requested, a number that is based in part on the increasing values of the properties owned by those nonprofits., The city had requested a total contribution of about $49.5 million; last year’s PILOT contributions represented 65 percent of that request, down from 68 percent in 2016 and 69 percent in 2015., (WGBH, a nonprofit, participates in the PILOT program. Last year, WGBH contributed the city’s requested amount of $138,800), Some nonprofits paid more of their requested share than others., Among the larger institutions that came closest to the city’s ask: Massachusetts General Hospital, which contributed about $6.9 million, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital which contributed $3 million – in each case about 98 percent of what the city had proposed., Boston University, which tops the list in terms of total property value and is exempt from at least $64 million in annual taxes, contributed $6 million – about 75 percent of what the city requested. , But other nonprofits’ contributions – especially universities and colleges -- were less in line with the city’s expectations. , Harvard University, whose Boston property alone is exempt from at least $48 million in annual property taxes, contributed $3.2 million – slightly more than half of the roughly $6 million requested by the city., And Northeastern University, exempt from at least $44 million in annual property taxes, contributed $1.3 million, less than one-fourth of the city’s PILOT request., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

607,[The 90th Anniversary Of Sacco And Vanzetti's Execution],"[Barbara Howard: This is All Things Considered, I'm Barbara Howard. Ninety years ago today, Sacco and Vanzetti were executed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti — Italian immigrants — had been arrested in 1920, accused of taking part in an armed robbery where two men died. For seven years, their case wound through the state's courts, attracting international attention. Sacco and Vanzetti ultimately were executed in the early morning hours — 90 years ago today — Aug. 23, 1927. The book ""Sacco and Vanzetti"" lays out the case. It is written by historian Bruce Watson, who's on the line. Thanks for joining us., Bruce Watson: Well, thank you for having me., Howard: So first, tell me a bit about who Sacco and Vanzetti were., Watson: They were, I think, uniquely fascinating men, and it's why this case endures so much. They were, on the surface, two ordinary Italian immigrants. But Sacco was both a very mild-mannered shoemaker, but he was also quite a fierce anarchist, and Vanzetti was a much more delightful, intellectual, self-taught man who wrote poetry and read everything he could get his hands on … great with children, roamed around the world and around America. They're very interesting men on their own., Howard: Here they were, two immigrants living in Massachusetts from Italy. The case, though, really got started in 1920 in Braintree — that's where the armed robbery happened. Tell me about it., Watson: Well it was the afternoon of April 15th, in 1920, and two payroll masters were bringing $15,000 in cash through the streets in small envelopes. And all of a sudden, two men who had been seen around town all day jumped on them and shoved them down and gunned them down. Moment later, a car came out of the shadows and up the street, and they jumped in and went around the corner and they were gone., Howard: How is it, then, that Sacco and Vanzetti came to be accused of this crime?, Watson: Well this crime, which shocked the whole area, was the study of an intense investigation, and they traced the car — what looked like the getaway car — to a garage in a town nearby and they staked out that garage. This was a couple of weeks later, now. And Sacco and Vanzetti came for the car and then they decided on that night, they didn't want to take it, they didn't like the way they were being watched. So they were on their way home on a streetcar, and police stopped the streetcar and arrested them, and their pictures were on the front page the next day, and they were under arrest for murder., Howard: Now Sacco and Vanzetti were Italian. It was not a very popular immigrant group back in 1920. And they also, as you said, were politically active as anarchists at the time of the crime. So talk about that., Watson: They seemed to have everything going against them as far as a jury would be concerned. First of all, they were Italian, and I really think that was a bigger factor. Italian immigrants were fairly new to Boston, been around maybe 20 or 30 years. There was already an image in the popular mind of mafia and gangsters, and the Italians were deeply resented and there were a lot of stereotypes about that. And so they fit that mold of a gangster. And then secondly, they were anarchists. And anarchists were the terrorists of their time. There had been all sorts of bombings that were attributed to anarchists, including some that Sacco and Vanzetti may have been involved in — midnight bombings, other types of bombings of courthouses, and things like that. So once it became known in the trial that they were anarchists, their goose was really cooked., Howard: OK, now they were convicted in 1921, but then it was six years before they were executed. Why was it so long?, Watson: There was a series of appeals waged at the state level, and their lawyer, Fred Moore, was not a particularly good lawyer, but he was very good at keeping the case alive. And the appeals took a while to go through the court. They went through the same judge. He had some years where he was ill. They eventually went to the state Supreme Court and in every case along the way, the conviction was upheld despite numerous, numerous things that today, would instantly get you a second trial., Howard: Like what?, Watson: Some of the witnesses recanted. Some of them were found to have extremely shady backgrounds. One of the state police who had originally said that one of the bullets found in one of the guards sort of fit the description of a bullet test fired through Sacco’s gun later claimed he never meant to imply that at all. There were all sorts of things that had to do with the judge whose bias became known over the years that he hated anarchists, absolutely despised them ... [he] told reporters at lunch time during the trial, he said ‘Wait until you see what I do to those anarchists in my courtroom.’ He was extremely biased and it went on for several years. Meanwhile, it was becoming a worldwide case. There were protests around the world as this was going on., Howard: What did happen, then, after Sacco and Vanzetti were executed?, Watson: Well after they were executed, the case remained in popular culture and popular conscience for about 40 or 50 years until people began to fade and die out, but there was a great deal of remorse, everywhere except Boston. Almost everybody in Boston really felt they that had done the right thing, that they'd stuck by the Commonwealth, [that] the original jury verdict was valid, and Sacco and Vanzetti had been given every chance, every chance for appeal. But around the world, there was a great deal of repercussion. There were protests at embassies the next day, and then for a little while, there were some bombings, some anarchist bombings. And then it entered the culture — in plays, there were a couple of movies, songs — Joan Baez wrote a song about it much later. It became sort of a blot on the American conscience. And to this day, no one is quite sure whether they were guilty or not. I have my opinion, others have their opinion, but they're still on trial in many ways and people are reviewing the evidence, even now., Howard: It should be noted, too, that in 1977, on the 50th anniversary of the execution, then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis declared Sacco and Vanzetti had been unfairly tried. Now, you say you have your opinion. What do you think? Were they innocent or guilty?, Watson: I have to say that first of all, I believe without a doubt they deserved a second trial. I think that there are some amount of evidence that would implicate Sacco, almost none against Vanzetti. However, there is a massive amount of doubts and much greater amount of doubt about the case for both men. And so, if there is such a thing as a reasonable doubt, there was far more than a reasonable doubt that they were guilty, so I believe they're innocent., Howard: But we'll never really know, will we?, Watson: I'm afraid not. There was an old Harvard professor who said he hoped that there would be an afterlife so that we could finally know the truth about the Sacco and Vanzetti case., Howard: OK. Thanks for joining us, Mr. Watson., Watson: Thank you., Howard: That's historian Bruce Watson. He is the author of the book ""Sacco and Vanzetti."" Today marks the 90th anniversary of the execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

612,[BU Professor Andrew Bacevich Questions Trump's Plan For Afghanistan],"[Barbara Howard: With President Trump announcing that the United States will remain in Afghanistan, many Americans are wondering about the wisdom of the decision to increase troop levels, and what is at nearly 16 years and running, the United States' longest running war. With us on the line to talk about the conflict in Afghanistan is Andrew Bacevich. He is a retired colonel in the U.S. Army and a professor emeritus of international relations and history at Boston University. Thanks for being on the line with us, Professor Bacevich., Andrew Bacevich: Glad to be with you., Barbara Howard: The war in Afghanistan's been going on, as we just mentioned, about 16 years. What is the United States fighting for at this point?, Andrew Bacevich: My guess is that the Trump administration is fighting not to fail, that the decision that the president announced last night to prolong the war stemmed from a realization that things are falling apart in Afghanistan. And I think from a political point of view, the president and his advisers are unable or unwilling, I should say, to accept responsibility for that failure., Barbara Howard: Earlier, Trump had criticized the U.S. presence in Afghanistan during his presidential campaign. So why, now, do you think he's changing his tune?, Andrew Bacevich: I think to understand the reversal, we need to begin by appreciating that the president is a person who is utterly devoid of principle. So when he was running for the presidency, right — he denounced the Afghanistan war. It was stupid. It was a waste. Elect me president, I’ll get us out. He's now changed his tune, but there are no fixed principles that provide the basis for Trump's policies., Barbara Howard: President Trump says, though ,that the U.S. will no longer be pursuing what he terms ‘nation building’ in Afghanistan, but will focus instead on fighting the terrorist threat coming out of that country. But what could that look like?, Andrew Bacevich: Well I think it's going to look pretty much what it has looked like since the Obama administration. That is to say the purpose of U.S. forces in Afghanistan really is two-fold. On the one hand, we have the so-called counterterrorism element that are trying to kill members of the Taliban or members of ISIS, and we have a larger number of U.S. troops that are engaged in advising and training the Afghan forces that they'll be able to manage things on their own. There's nothing that the president said last night that indicates we're going to do anything differently, albeit we may do it with an additional increment of U.S. forces., Barbara Howard: You've been a prominent critic of U.S. policy in Afghanistan. What do you think President Trump ought to be doing?, Andrew Bacevich: I think that the core question really is not with regard to Afghanistan, but is with regard to the larger threat, so-called. In the immediate wake of 9/11, long ago now, President George W. Bush declared a global war on terrorism. The concerted use of American military power was going to eliminate this threat. So we've been at it, we've been fighting this war for 15 plus years now. And the fact of the matter is, our military efforts have exacerbated things. We've made things worse., So the place to begin, I think, is to ask the question: Does waging war on terrorism make sense? I think the answer is no, and therefore we need to revise our policy, de-emphasizing the role of the military, and find more effective ways of protecting the country. And I think the bottom line there is that we should treat terrorism as a form of international criminality to be dealt with primarily through police methods, not through the use of military forces, in particular, not through the use of military forces that are occupying countries in the Islamic world as U.S. forces have been doing in Afghanistan for a decade and a half., The issues here are primarily political, not military. The George W. Bush administration insisted that the problem was a military problem. This is the third administration in a row that has clung to that defective conviction. Now, President Trump has surrounded himself with senior military officers. My sense is that the military itself is very reluctant to acknowledge that their efforts over the past decade and a half have failed and indeed have been counterproductive., Barbara Howard: Do you see the U.S. exiting Afghanistan while President Trump is in office?, Andrew Bacevich: No. No, we've got a president who is incapable of admitting error. I think it's almost inconceivable that he'll make a similar presentation to the one he did last night, go on TV, and say ‘Oh by the way, I made a mistake. I'm changing my mind with regard to Afghanistan.’ So he has made this war his and I think he's going to be stuck with it for the duration of his presidency., Barbara Howard: OK, thank you so much, Professor Bacevich., Andrew Bacevich: Thank you., Barbara Howard: That's Andrew Bacevich. He is a retired colonel in the U.S. Army and professor emeritus of international relations and history at Boston University., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

But on this day, she was busy handing out eclipse glasses., , The library only received 25 of them, and the room felt pretty tense as the raffle began. People sat forward in their chairs as tickets were pulled out of a bucket, and they cheered as their names were called.   Of course the demand means there were some unhappy people, and some tears were shed by young people, who were encouraged not to cry, because people would share., Sure enough, once everybody was outside, the glasses started getting handed around. And for a crowd of people, 25 glasses turned out to be enough, as it became less about that and more about the amazing scene above., ""This is awesome!"" one child exclaimed., ""I see the moon is about to cover the sun!"" another said as she looked up with the glasses on her face. , It wasn't just the kids who are excited. , ""I see!

""I wish I was in the line of the totality, so I'd be able to see the complete solar flares coming off the sun,"" he said., , Not everyone was overwhelmed by the eclipse. ""Ehh,"" said Taina Jay unenthusiastically. ""I can't really see it from here."" She thought everything was going to go dark, so it makes sense why what happened was a little underwhelming., , But for some of the library guests, the day meant more than just seeing their first solar eclipse.

616,[Questions Of First Amendment Violations Swirl After Saturday's 'Free Speech' Rally],"[Barbara Howard: This is All Things Considered, I'm Barbara Howard. Boston is getting accolades from across the political spectrum for keeping the peace at Saturday's rally, dubbed a ""free speech"" rally by its organizers. But now that the dust is settling, some are asking whether the peace was kept at the cost of free speech. With me on the line is Carol Rose, she’s Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts. Thanks for talking with us, Carol., Carol Rose: Happy to be here, thank you, Barbara., Barbara Howard: In the days leading up to Saturday's rallies, Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans said that the two opposing groups would be kept separate for their own protection. Was that reasonable?, Carol Rose: Well I think that in principle, it, of course it's reasonable to have neutral time, place and manner restrictions to make sure that maximum number of people are able to exercise their freedom of speech. We're fortunate here in Boston that the Boston Common is large enough as a public space to actually permit that to happen., Barbara Howard: Well of the buffer zone, though, around the bandstand, or where the original organizers were,  it was quite wide. Without some sort of amplification, it would be impossible to hear the speakers., Carol Rose: Problems arose from free speech perspective insofar that the buffer zone was so large for the people who ... had a permit to speak on the bandstand that the people who wanted to hear them were not allowed, and most importantly, that the press was not allowed – a way that their voices could have been amplified. If it is in fact true the reports that we have that the media was prevented from being able to hear the message or to relay the message to the outside world, that raises deep civil rights, civil liberties concerns from a freedom of speech perspective., Barbara Howard: Well some of the speakers and others trying to attend the event on the bandstand, the Parkman Bandstand, said that they were turned away at the barriers and Commissioner Evans was asked about that and here's what he had to say., Clip of Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans: ""I'm not going to listen to people who come in here who want to talk about hate. And you know, what if they didn't get in, that’s a good thing, because their message isn't what we want to hear."", Barbara Howard: Now that begs the question, was he motivated by keeping people separate or by suppressing free speech?, Carol Rose: That's right. The job of the police is to keep everyone safe and to make sure that everyone's speech is protected. That's what the police are supposed to do,and by providing a permit on the Boston Common, that's what initially they said they were going to do. If in practice, they were motivated by not allowing their speech to be heard, that raises serious First Amendment and constitutional concerns., Barbara Howard: As people were approaching the bandstand, it put the officers there in a quandary because how are they to know which people are going in there to make trouble?, Carol Rose: Right. And we don't – we're still gathering facts on how they made that determination and who was allowed in and who was not letting people in. But the bottom line is what we do know, is that the press is not allowed to go into the bandstand area, and that raises deep constitutional concerns for the ACLU., Barbara Howard: Now some who were wearing Trump T-shirts showing up in the Common trying to make their way to the bandstand were besieged, of course, by counter-protesters, that was expected – yelling at them that they did not have a right to be heard. What are your thoughts on that?, Carol Rose: Well, the First Amendment ensures not only that you have a right to speak, but that the right of listeners to hear your message is also protected. So to that extent, if there were people who wanted to hear from the people on the bandstand or who wanted to cover it as reporters, there's a separate and independent free speech right for the message to be received, to be heard by its intended audience. So that's why this raises constitutional concerns., Barbara Howard: John Medlar speaking for the original organizers says that he does plan to have another rally. Are these the kinds of issues that your organization, the ACLU, will likely take up on behalf of his group?, Carol Rose: Well, the ACLU’s client is really the Constitution, so what we're interested in doing is to [work] with city leaders here in Boston and around the country to make sure that we're able to have rallies that are both peaceful and where all the voices have an opportunity to be heard by people who would like to hear from them. But I think it's important for people to recognize that we as a nation and Massachusetts as a state and Boston as a city are trying to find our way forward to defend public safety and freedom of speech, and to speak out for equal rights under the law. And I think that's something that we can do as a society. I think Boston made a lot of progress with 40,000 people showing up and peacefully protesting, but there's a lot that we could do better in terms of making sure that free speech rights are protected, and that we also don't have police practices where people got pepper sprayed and dogs were brought out and things like that after the rally. So there's a lot of improvement we have to do, but I think that Massachusetts is open minded and finding a way forward and hopefully will be a model for the rest of the nation., Barbara Howard: OK, thanks so much, Carol., Carol Rose: Great. Thank you so much. These are hard issues, Barbara, as you can see., Barbara Howard: OK, thanks so much, Carol Rose. That's Executive Director of the Massachusetts American Civil Liberties Union.

617,[Counter Protester Helps Trump Supporter In Midst Of Saturday's 'Free Speech' Rally],"[Barbara Howard: This is All Things Considered, I'm Barbara Howard. The march and rally on Boston Common Saturday was notably peaceful, but there were a few exceptions. Very few white supremacists showed up. They were far, far outnumbered by the 40,000 who were gathered there for a counter protest, but some people did show up on Boston Common wearing Trump T-shirts or carrying Trump banners, that sort of thing. And more often than not, that resulted in them being shouted down, with police quickly swooping in to escort them to safety. But there were also images from the rally of some of the 40,000 counter protesters who did step up to protect those who found themselves in the middle of a hostile crowd. And one of them was Imani Williams. She's on the line. Thanks for joining us, Imani., Imani Williams: Thank you, Barbara for having me., Barbara Howard: Let's say right off the bat that you are a 27-year-old black woman, you work at a hospital in New Haven, Connecticut and what, you came up to Boston?, Imani Williams: Yep, I came up to Boston with a couple of friends. We weren't really sure it was going to happen there after Charlottesville. So you know, I brought extra medical supplies, like I wasn't sure how many people were going to show up., Barbara Howard: So take me back there. You're standing – what, were you in the grass, you're behind a barricade? What, a guy shows up, what? Tell me physically – what did you see?, Imani Williams: I saw a confrontation happening with a Trump supporter in the middle of getting escorted by two police officers. The crowd of about 30 people was swirling around them, making it hard to move forward, and I knew I could help the situation. I thought it was important to step in. So I went in, I was kind of was behind him, and I just kind of put my hand on his backpack and after just telling him I was there to help him, I helped clear the way. I was like, “Guys, he's not going to learn anything from us standing in a circle screaming at him., Barbara Howard: So you put your hand on this man's backpack. Did he react to you at all?, Imani Williams: At that point, I had kind of gained his trust and I told him ""I'm here to help you, I just want to get you through to the other side."" I kind got brushed off a few times, but had just held my ground and said, you know, I'm just going to stand here till this guy realizes that I'm on his side for now, for this moment – not in general – and ready to help. At one point, I had said to him, I don’t agree with your ideals, but I will help you now. He said thank you, but that was pretty much all we spoke. I didn't really speak to him, I didn't really look at him, and I didn't really look at any – I started off with one guy, and by the time he got through the crowd, I had like five or six guys that just decided, they were like, ""Hey can I come with you?"" and I was like ""Sure."", Barbara Howard: OK, so you pushed through the crowd, and then where did you end up?, Imani Williams: Once we got through the mass group of people, it kind of dispersed. And once I knew that they were safe, I said ""You guys have to go all the way around, I'm not going to bring you, but I think you're safe at this point."", Barbara Howard: Now you were quoted in The Boston Globe saying, “We shouldn't be like them. It's the right thing to do at the end of the day. We're all part of the same country. It's unfortunate what's happening, but the response we should have is to be nonviolent.” That's what the Globe quoted you as saying in the moment., Imani Williams: Absolutely. I didn't want things to escalate., Barbara Howard: So, you know, a partner at a law firm, Prince Lobel Tye, a media group focusing on journalists and first amendment free speech issues, wrote about you and here's what he said in his writings. He said “In my view, she"" – she being you, Imani – ""she is a first amendment and civil rights hero, someone who by her example, reminds us to heed the voice of the better angels of our nature.” Want to respond to that?, Imani Williams: I've always been humble by nature, so all of this positive attention is overwhelming, it’s appreciated. But I just always consider myself a face in the crowd. I knew that the message of nonviolence was more important than me possibly putting myself at risk. And I did not support this man. I don't support his agenda. I don't support his ideals, but I do support the first amendment freedom of speech in the United States., Barbara Howard: Thank you, Imani., Imani Williams: Thank you., Barbara Howard: That's Imani Williams of New Haven, Connecticut, who stepped in to help a Trump supporter who was being heckled Saturday on Boston Common.

619,[Boston 'Free Speech' Rally Organizer John Medlar Criticizes Rally Setup And Promises Future Events],"[The organizer behind Saturday's so-called ""free speech"" rally — protested by tens of thousands people — says his group will be back with future events., “You haven’t seen the last of us,” John Medlar, a spokesman for the Boston Free Speech Movement, told Adam Reilly when he joined him on Greater Boston along with former Boston Police Superintendent-in-Chief Dan Linskey and WGBH News Reporter Bianca Vázquez Toness., Fewer than 100 people came out to the Parkman Bandstand for a rally organizers said was aimed at promoting free speech. However, many were concerned some of the speakers would be promoting discriminatory and racists beliefs. In response, 40,000 to turn out to protest., In an effort to avoid a repeat of violent clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia a week prior — which killed one woman — Boston Police kept the two groups in entirely separate areas of the common. The move was criticized by Medlar who said it denied his group of their right to free speech because no one could hear them and several people could not even get to them., According to the group's permit for the event, the group could have used a battery-powered amplifier, but there was no amplifier Saturday. When asked why, Medlar said, ""We were worried about the cost, but that's probably an investment that we're going to have to make for a future event. We've never done anything this big before. There were things that we did not foresee, and an amplifier would have been extremely helpful."" , Asked what the public would have heard if they were able to get closer, Medlar said, “they would have heard us talking about first amendment related issues ... This wasn’t just an event for anyone to come in and just say whatever the heck they want. When we say this is a free speech rally, we meant this is a rally about the issue of free speech and that’s what everyone of the 14 people we had on our list came here to speak about.”, “There’s no exact science to this,” said Linskey about the buffer zone between the groups, noting that police in Charlottesville did not put enough distance between the protesters. “There was intelligence that people were intent on throwing bottles of acid … that people were going to throw bottles acid at the speakers and rally participants."", Police said the hours-long event was mostly peaceful and deemed it a success.

622,[8 Observations On The 'Free Speech' Rally And Counter Protests In Boston],"[Boston had been bracing for a major confrontation as counter protestors promised to confront the ""Free Speech Rally"" on the common today. But that didn't come to fruition thanks to police barricades, which kept the rally participants far away from counter protestors, who numbered around 40,000 strong. It wasn't until things moved away from the park that the tension escalated to violence. Here are a few observations on the day., 1. The self-described “free speech” demonstrators on Boston Common today were like tethered goats., Their city permit limited their number to 100. From my vantage point, probably 80 yards, it looked as if there were fewer. I didn’t see any evidence of amplification equipment. At about 12:50 p.m., the right-wing demonstrators left their redoubt, the neo-classical Parkman Bandstand. Police escorted them through a mostly peaceful, but notably hostile crowd of counter protesters. According to estimates, the crowd reached 40,000., 2. It was hard to get a handle on what this would look like., Speculating about what could have happened at events such as this is a risky business. Still, I’ve covered demonstrations and riots of varying intensity over the past 40 years, and in my judgment the potential existed for Boston to turn into a Charlottesville, Va. ­–– but in reverse, with the left physically savaging the right., 3. Police strategy and tactics are what made the difference., The physical plan — double and sometime triple security fences, widely spaced and patrolled by even-tempered but firm cops –– put the speech demonstrators inside a ring of law enforcement. The real muscle, riot equipped officers, was nearby. They were visible to some, but were not the front-line presence., 4. In terms of guaranteeing the exercise of constitutional rights, both the left and the right (technically) enjoyed free assembly. , Although the left – mainly local counter protesters –– controlled the terrain. Limiting myself to what I saw, I witnessed three instances of pro-Donald Trump individuals or small groups set upon and surrounded by opponents. In all three instances, the Trump folks were verbally barraged. In two cases, they were physically assaulted and knocked to the ground. In one case, the crowd intervened to save the assaulted from their attackers. It was jarring, but I saw worse during Boston’s school desegregation crisis., 5. In terms of free speech, the left won the day. , If the right-wing free speech demonstrators tried to speak, I couldn’t hear them. I doubt they could talk to anyone but themselves and their police protectors. There was no doubt that this was a crowd opposed to Trump, neo-Nazis and white supremacy., 6. We've seen this before — kind of., I think it’s possible to make a limited comparison with the Women’s March that took place on nearly the same ground several months ago. The over whelming majority of counter protesters were what you’d recognize as progressive, that is they would fit in nicely in Dudley Square, Jamaica Plain or Somerville. It struck me, however, that there were sizable numbers of anti-fascists, or antifa as they are known. Why note the distinction? Because the antifa are younger, more energetic and more aggressive. They also seem to subscribe to a collective discipline, at least within their cohort. One woman, 20ish to my eyes, said she considered herself to be “an anti-Trump shock trooper.” She declined to be identified, but spoke passionately of the need to fight what she called “the hard right.”, 7. All hands were on deck for crowd and vehicle control., As I walked away from the Common toward Copley Square, I noted that Boston Public Works trucks blocked all of the vehicular approaches to the demonstrations. That was also the case during the Gay Pride March in late spring. Clearly authorities have conditioned themselves to guard against the latest method of terror attacks., 8. A musical interlude., At 1:50 p.m., I paused by the Arlington Street Church, the cathedral of Boston Unitarianism (if there can be such a thing). Arlington Street played significant roles in the civil rights movement, the opposition to the war in Vietnam, and the crusade for gay and lesbian rights. For several minutes, the belfry chimed out the sounds of “We Shall Overcome”.

623,"[A Week After Charlottesville, Boston Braces For ‘Free Speech’ Protests]","[The City of Boston and its residents are on edge, preparing for a so-called ‘free speech’ rally on Boston Common Saturday afternoon that is expected to draw tens of thousands of conservative activists and leftist counter-demonstrators., Many here in Boston worry the event will attract some of the same white supremacists and Neo-Nazis who sparked violence on and near the University of Virginia in Charlottesville last weekend, attacking hundreds and killing a 32-year-old woman., But organizers of the so-called free speech rally are trying to distance themselves from those groups., ""There's been a lot of misinformation out there about what we actually stand for,"" said John Medlar, 23, who leads the Boston Free Speech Coalition, the organization holding the permit for Saturday's rally., ""We were planning this rally long before Charlottesville,” Medlar explained. “We saw the rising tide of political violence in this country. Charlottesville is just the latest example. We wanted to do something that was, to us, fun and interesting but also more broadly important on a deeper level."", Medlar says that broader goal was to bring people together around Constitutional values, specifically the First Amendment., Critics of the rally, however, point out many of the invited speakers spew hate speech, and KKK members are expected to attend., On Malcolm X Boulevard in Roxbury, local civil rights activist Monica Cannon spoke to reporters on Friday., ""There is a misconception that Boston is not racist, and that this is a haven for black folks and other marginalized communities,” Cannon said, reading from a statement. “It is a fact that deep-rooted, anti-black racism and white supremacy thrives here just as it does everywhere else in the world, and there is a history that affirms that fact."", Cannon is founder of the nonprofit Violence in Boston, one of many local groups partnering with the national Black Lives Matter movement to sponsor a counter-protest., ""You can't say you don't stand for something, but everybody you have on your speaking agenda stands for exactly just that,"" Cannon said., Cannon sees it as moral obligation to confront the kind of speech and violence seen in Charlottesville and widely expected in Boston on Saturday., ""I'm a black woman living in Roxbury and I don't have the privilege of ignoring this problem,” Cannon said. “Ignoring the problem has never made it go away, so I think it's an obligation morally, but more so as a community member to stand up and resist it."", Organizers of the counter-protest expect as many as 30,000 people will join the resistance, marching from Roxbury Community College to the Common., Boston Mayor Marty Walsh wants the community to come together and stand against hate, white supremacists and their ideology, but, hoping to avoid conflict, he's urging counter-protesters to stay away from the Common., ""At the same time, we can't look away,” Walsh said at a news conference Friday. “The children of our city are watching. We have to make it clear what we stand for in the City of Boston."", Walsh says more than 500 officers are being deployed, and police won't tolerate any incitements of violence at the rally., ""We're going to respect their right to free speech. In return, they must respect our city,” Walsh said. “If anything gets out of hand, we will shut it down."", There are severe restrictions in place. No backpacks, sticks or anything that could be used as a weapon., The Boston Common Garage, the Swan Boats and the Frog Pond will all be closed due to public safety, and the MBTA says it will work with state and city partners to ""maintain a safe transit environment."", Fencing and concrete barriers are lining streets along the Common, and crews have installed cameras at the bandstand, where speakers will address the crowds., Kirk is the Managing Editor and Correspondent for higher education at WGBH News.

625,['One Ounce Of Hatred In The City Of Boston Is One Too Many Now'],"[ , Barbara Howard: It’s a rally that appears to be taking on a life of its own. If social media is any indicator, thousands of counter protesters are planning to flood Boston Common tomorrow in response to a so-called Free Speech Rally that features known white nationalists as speakers. With me in the studio is Monica Cannon of Boston's Roxbury neighborhood. She's founder of a local group called Violence in Boston. It's partnering with a national Black Lives Matter group. Thanks for coming in Monica., Monica Cannon: Thanks for having me., Barbara Howard: So we should make it clear from the start that these groups, there are so many of them, there's no one group that's the counter to the originally planned rally. Many unaffiliated individuals are also expected to show up, and the police have set up certain parameters with organizers and the city of Boston has to keep the two groups apart — the original group and the counter-protesters., But being apart, that does not mean that you can't hear each other or that you might rub shoulders coming and going to the event. The original organizer, John Medlar, here's what he had to say., Clip: We don't want violence, you know. And, you know, sometimes that means you don't want people to get in each other's faces because, you know, when tempers are really heated and people get in each other's faces, that's when, you know, fights tend to break out, and that's exactly what we don't want., Barbara Howard: Do you buy his talk that he's nonviolent?, Monica Cannon: No, I don't buy it. And the reason why I don't buy it is because of the lineup of speakers that he plans to bring into the city of Boston, and a lot of the correspondence that has transpired on social media in regards to this event does not align with the things that he said., Barbara Howard: OK, so Medlar, I should point out, is 23-years-old, and he characterizes himself as being one of the older of his group. He says their aged 17 to 23, and he says there's maybe a half dozen in this original group of organizers of the so-called Free Speech Rally. Here's what he also says., Clip: None of the people that we have invited to our rally identify with the label ‘alt-right’., Barbara Howard: Now, do you buy that?, Monica Cannon: No., Barbara Howard: What do you know about the speakers?, Monica Cannon: So, I know Kyle Chapman is a speaker. The moment you type his name into Google it pops up that he is a white nationalist. Joe Biggs is another speaker who is responsible for pizza-gate, and that's kind of self-explanatory., Barbara Howard: That's the one where Hillary Clinton was running some crazy ring, and a guy popped off and it was a mess., Monica Cannon: Right. And then Alex Jones from Infowars, I believe it's called. So yet none of the speakers in there — there are a couple of others — but I don't know their names, align with what he's saying for the press., Also I would like to point out that we continuously like to downplay the size of what they're saying. ... One is one too many. One of them is one too many. One ounce of hatred in the city of Boston is one ... too many now., Barbara Howard: Now he says he invited Black Lives Matter to speak. How realistic was that?, Monica Cannon: So we've seen things on social media of him saying that he would love to have somebody from Black Lives Matter speak. Well, we will not be going to speak at their platform. We have our own platform., Barbara Howard: Now the white nationalists have been lashing out not only in racist terms, but in anti-Semitic terms. Is there any coordination between the black and Jewish community?, Monica Cannon: Absolutely. So we have a lot of amazing allies from the Jewish community. Jewish social action organizations will be standing in solidarity with us that day and marching with us. We have had the LGBTQI community and organizations like GLADD who have committed to walking with us.

629,[Boston 'Free Speech Rally' Organizer John Medlar Talks Motive And Goals],"[Click on the audio player above to listen to Part I of this interview. Part II is included later in this post., Joe Mathieu: You're listening to WGBH's Morning Edition, I'm Joe Mathieu. The deadly clash between white supremacists and protesters in Charlottesville has put a microscope on a rally planned for Boston Common this Saturday. Mayor Marty Walsh quickly condemned the so-called free speech rally organized by a group accused of sympathizing with white supremacists, but little is still known about the Boston Free Speech Coalition. We're joined today by John Medlar, one of the event’s organizers who, in fact, holds the permit for this event and has surfaced as the unofficial spokesman for the group. Good morning, John, and welcome to WGBH News., John Medlar: Thank you for having me, it's a pleasure to be here., Joe Mathieu: You have been talked about a lot. We keep seeing your image around this week, many things have been said about you in the media this week. What do you want us to know about you?, John Medlar: Well, what I would like you to know is that there's been a lot of misinformation out there about what we actually stand for. And if anything, you know, we've ... we were planning this rally long before Charlottesville, and all of those people that we had invited up until that point, we had booked long before Charlottesville. Let me start by telling you more about what specifically this group of people that we've assembled is standing for., Joe Mathieu: It's a shrinking group, I understand., John Medlar: Oh it's ... It shrunk briefly. Well at least — I'm talking not about the list of speakers, I'm talking about the core group that's organizing this., Joe Mathieu: Please do., John Medlar: Like I said, we call ourselves the Boston Free Speech Coalition, or the New Free Speech Movement. I think the former is more descriptive of what we are. We are located in Boston. We're a bunch of local young people like myself — I'm actually one of the oldest and I'm 23, our youngest is 17 — and it's about a half dozen local students or so that got together and we saw the rising tide of political violence in this country, Charlottesville's just the latest example. And what we thought ... that we wanted to do something that, to us, was fun and interesting but also more broadly important, on a deeper level, that was to try to bring people together around our core constitutional values — particularly the First Amendment, which as, you know, free speech is the mechanism by which, in the words of Dr. Jordan Peterson, is the mechanism by which we keep our society functioning. And our original vision for this was to assemble a broad line of speakers from various different points of views. And what happened was that, you know, as we started looking for speakers and stuff, we got initially a lot of interest particularly from white right-wingers. It seems at this point in history, it seems that the political right is most concerned right now about their free speech rights being taken away., Joe Mathieu: Before you go on, what do you mean by right-wingers? How else could you describe these people?, John Medlar: I mean people who identify themselves as right-wingers., Joe Mathieu: There are a lot of subtleties around here., John Medlar: There are, there are. You know, I'm personally fascinated by different political ideas and different ideologies, so I talked to lots of different sorts of people on the left and the right. And I find, you know, there's a lot of different subgroups, a lot of different ideologies out there. I can, you know, divide the so-called left and right into dozens of different sub factions, many of which are more united by what they perceived to be common enemies than ... like, for example, the alt-right and the alt-light so-called factions don't particularly like each other. The alt-light see themselves as mostly pro-Western but don't have a racial agenda, whereas the alt-right is more of a white identity movement., Joe Mathieu: Some of us are having trouble keeping up with the labels, you know?, John Medlar: It is, there's labels everywhere. And the problem with all these labels, you see, you know, people throw the label 'Nazi' around everywhere. It used to be you could easily tell the who the Nazis were because, you know, back in World War II, the enemy wore uniforms and it wasn't hard to tell who you were supposed to be fighting. But in this day and age, the word 'Nazi' is thrown out just like candy. I've been called a Nazi for for my involvement in this, mostly just because of internet rumors. I like to try to use the labels that they apply to themselves first and foremost. And, you know, if I see someone walking around you know with — carrying swastikas or giving the Nazi salute, it's pretty clear to me that those people are definitely Nazis. But none of the people that we have invited to our rally identify with the label 'alt-right.', Joe Mathieu: Did you invite all the speakers? Or, you said, some, as you put it, right-wingers, reached out to you., John Medlar: We did have a lot of people reach out to us and so we talked with them and ... if, you know, we felt like they would be an interesting person to have at our rally who presented a unique point of view, then we extended the invitation to them., Joe Mathieu: Would white supremacy be among those points of view?, John Medlar: The problem with white supremacy is that they don't extend the same rights to other people. They're happy to use the First Amendment as a shield to protect themselves, but they ... but because they're supremacists, they don't extend the same rights to people of color. And we believe that, you know, the Constitution applies to everyone., Joe Mathieu: There was ... A number of speakers have dropped out as we have heard because of the coverage. Are you glad that they have — at least those who have been framed as white supremacists, as white nationalists, as Neo-Nazis, whatever label?, John Medlar: No, because even though there are certainly real white supremacists out there — like some of the groups that were involved in Charlottesville, for example, Identity Europa and Vanguard. Vanguard was the group of who ... a member of whom drove his car into a group of counter protesters and the group pretty much stood ... doubled down and stood by his actions. So, it's pretty clear what the what those particular groups stand for., Joe Mathieu: Augustus Invictus, for instance, has been mentioned a lot of times, and you spoke about this earlier in the week. This is someone who has called for a second American Civil War, and he will not be speaking Saturday, right? You seem to suggest that you regret that cancellation., John Medlar: We regret it because our mix up created a impression that we were not dedicated to free speech, it sort of created a breach of trust., , Joe Mathieu: Is that a fair point of view or not? Is it fair to suggest that you're not open to free speech if you're not having white supremacists there?, John Medlar: I think that ... well we defend the free speech of everyone, but with free speech also comes freedom of association. , Joe Mathieu: Will there be any racist speakers on Saturday?, John Medlar: We don't believe that any of our speakers are racist. Again, that's another term that gets thrown around out there. The most ... the most controversial views that ... at least ... as what as far as race is concerned, the most controversial views we've mostly heard from people say, like Kyle Chapman or Augustus Invictus, is that bigotry against white people is also wrong, in addition. And we think that bigotry against anybody is wrong., , Click on the audio player above to listen to Part II., John Medlar: If people are bringing overtly white supremacist symbols like swastikas or KKK flags or using the Nazi salute, we will disassociate ourselves from them., Joe Mathieu: How do you do that one?, John Medlar: Well, we physically separate ourselves as a group., Joe Mathieu: We can talk about a lot of things and argue different positions here, but does it bother you that regular people who live around Boston are afraid of this thing you're putting together?, John Medlar: It it does because we don't think they should be afraid of us. You know, for one thing, we've agreed to comply with the Boston Police Department's conditions of, you know, completely disarming ourselves and, you know, having the physical barriers there to keep us separate from the counter protesters. I think that's a good thing. We don't want violence, you know, and sometimes that means you don't want people to get in each other's faces because, you know, when tempers are really heated and people get in each other's faces, that's when, you know, fights tend to break out and that's exactly what we don't want. We want people to come together around our shared constitutional values, we want people to start exchanging words again instead of exchanging fists and clubs and sticks and things like that., Joe Mathieu: Have you been threatened this week?, John Medlar: Yes, I have., Joe Mathieu: Tell me about it., John Medlar: Well, it's ... most of it just comes from the, you know, the basic internet hate mobs that are like 'Oh, you terrible KKK white supremacist, we're going to shut you down, we're going to hunt you down, and stuff like that. Most of it is just internet hate mob stuff. Some of it has been a bit more serious, like the Boston Police Department told us about communications they had heard about local gangs saying that, talking about, you know, putting aside their differences to try to shoot up our event or something and we're at ... I mean, hey., Joe Mathieu: Do you believe that?, John Medlar: Well ... I'm glad I'm uniting somebody! Even if it's for ... you know, I joke. , Joe Mathieu: Police told you this in your meeting this week? , John Medlar: That is correct. So we are aware of —, Joe Mathieu: Do you ever stop and think that you're in over your head?, John Medlar: Oh, there was quite a significant period of time, and like right after Charlottesville — you know, like I said, we had been planning this months before Charlottesville — and when that happened and all this hysteria blew up and our event was being, you know, linked to that and everything, there was a serious period of mostly panic, sort of around the following 24 to 48 hours when everything was up in the air, we were very seriously considering canceling the event. We almost canceled the event. But, we did stop and think quite a bit, and what we realized was, is that this thing had taken on a momentum of its own, and even if we canceled it and told people not to go, a lot of people would still go anyway, both to sort of stand their ground in our place or to counter-protest. And we felt like this had to be handled properly, we had to coordinate with the city of Boston and with the police department to make sure that this was handled properly and that everyone stayed safe. What if people had showed up to sort of demonstrate in our place without our coordinating with the police department to protect them? We want everyone to be able to go home completely unharmed. That's our end goal with this. , Joe Mathieu: With that said, John Medlar, fast forward to Saturday. You have two hours for the actual rally and all the set up and break down. At the end of the day Saturday, what scenario would be described as a success?, John Medlar: We want people to show up. We want people to enjoy themselves responsibly. We want people to listen to views, some of which we hope they will agree with, some of which they might, you know, disagree with, but hopefully will think 'Oh, that was an interesting point.' And, you know, that's one of the reasons why I'm fascinated by all these different ideologies out there., Joe Mathieu: How do you describe yourself politically? , John Medlar: I describe myself as a Libertarian, so I'm very much a small government guy. I think that it's ... I've also had a very Catholic upbringing, so my parents raised me to put a very strongly ... emphasis on personal responsibility and virtues. And I think that you can't have virtue when, you know, the government is compelling you to do things. I think society is better off when individuals take it upon themselves to build themselves up and to be the best possible people that they can be rather than, you know, that and shirking those responsibilities and leaving it to government bureaucrats who are less efficient at everything., Joe Mathieu: John Medlar, an organizer for the Boston free speech rally set for this Saturday on the Common. WGBH News will be there, John, and we do hope that everyone stays safe.

630,[Embattled Mental Health Provider Faces New Fine From OSHA],"[The federal agency that monitors workplace dangers has issued a $207,000 fine against a private psychiatric hospital in Lowell for failing to protect its workers from violent patients. , The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said that Lowell Treatment Center promised more than a year ago to fix a range of safety violations. But since last December, violent patients have badly beaten at least three workers at the 41-bed hospital, causing black eyes, bruises, one concussion and weeks lost from work, according to OSHA documents. , The Lowell facility is owned by the for-profit Universal Health Services, the country’s biggest provider of mental health care. The publicly traded company is based in King of Prussia, Pa., and operates in Massachusetts as Arbour Health System. The company has frequently come under fire from state and federal regulators for patient-care violations and concerns over the physical safety of its workers. , In June, OSHA notified the company that its employees still faced serious hazards at the Lowell site. Employees working at the treatment center in Lowell “were exposed to acts of workplace violence, including … verbal threats of assault, assaults, choking, punching, kicks, bites, scratches and/or pulling of hair,” OSHA official Anthony Covello wrote. , Judy Merel, a spokeswoman for Arbour Health System, disputed the charges from OSHA, saying that the company is meeting or exceeding worker safety guidelines. In an email, Merel called OSHA’s statement “inaccurate” and said Lowell Treatment Center is “committed to the safety and well-being of our patients, their families and our staff.” , Social worker David Wilensky worked at the Lowell Treatment Center for 11 years, but quit last year partly out of concern for employee safety. ""The staff turnover on the inpatient units was very high, and they had a hard time keeping people employed there because people got hurt,” Wilensky said. “I had several friends taken out on stretchers at one time or another.” , State legislators are debating a range of bills aimed at preventing the violence faced by hospital workers. Karen Coughlin, a member of the Massachusetts Nurses Association, said the problem is getting worse. “Between 2012 and 2014, the incidence of violence nearly doubled for nurses and nurse assistants,” said Coughlin. , OSHA’s most recent enforcement at the Lowell Treatment Center comes amidst increased oversight of Arbour-owned hospitals by numerous regulators, including the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, which licenses the hospital, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the U.S. Department of Justice. , Two years ago OSHA issued a “hazard alert” letter issued to Pembroke Hospital, which is also owned by Arbour, that flagged the high number of workers assaulted by violent patients and called for improved staffing and safety measures. , OSHA opened an earlier investigation into Pembroke Hospital after a 22-year-old patient attacked a nurse and nearly tore off her ear when she was trying to place him in restraints. OSHA has said it has found no violations in that probe.]"

632,[LISTEN: What's in a Name? Navigating 'Alt-Right' Terminology],"[Barbara Howard: The so-called Free Speech Rally is scheduled for Saturday in Boston, but is it really about free speech? The rally organizers call themselves the Boston Free Speech Coalition or another benign term: the New Free Speech Movement. But among the speakers slated to be at their Boston rally are right wing extremists. It's not easy to navigate terms designed to disguise what groups truly stand for. So with us on the line is John Daniszewski. He is Vice President for Standards at the Associated Press, the AP. He articulates the AP wire service standards for what you read in many of America's newspapers from coast to coast and even overseas. Thanks for joining us, John., John Daniszewski: Happy to be here., Barbara Howard: Let's talk about some of the euphemisms and titles like that., John Daniszewski: Well, the big one that we been working with is ‘alt-right,’ which is a term that most people ha[d] not heard of until last year when activists began to use it to describe white nationalist or white separatist or white supremacist groups getting into fights., Barbara Howard: Well, earlier this week, you updated the AP standard. You added the word ""anti-Semitism"" to the definition of ""alt-right."" I'm surprised it wasn't already there. What prompted this change?, John Daniszewski: In looking at the activities of these groups, we saw that anti-Semitism was a big part of their presentation and thought it would be more correct to say that specifically in the guidance., Barbara Howard: So on Tuesday when the president was speaking with reporters he used the term ""alt-right."" He turned it on its head though, coining the new term ""alt-left"" equating those protesting against the white nationalists in Charlottesville with the white nationalists themselves. So let's listen to what he had to say:, Clip: What about the ""alt-left"" that came charging at the as you say the ""alt-right."" Do they have any semblance of guilt?, Barbara Howard: Well, now critics say that that's a false equivalency on President Trump’s part. Can you talk about that?, John Daniszewski: Well, I don't know if false equivalency is the right word, but ""alt-left"" is a rather new newly coined word, as you said. It's a label that is applied to far leftist factions., Barbara Howard: Well let's talk about some other terms that have been coined relatively recently. There’s the term ""anti-fa"" — the ""anti-fa"" movement...a far left, anti-fascism group. You say it's not that new, with antecedents dating back to the 1930s. Can you talk about that?, John Daniszewski: Well, yes, because in the 1930’s, they were the people who brawled in the streets against fascists in various countries. That's what the so called ""anti-fa"" traces its roots to. And I think also they became somewhat known for their anti-globalist demonstrations of the 1990’s and even around the Trump inauguration. ""Anti-fa"" activists were accused of smashing windows or getting into fights., Barbara Howard: Well, I know at the WGBH newsroom, when we use the term ""alt-right"" or this so-called Free Speech Rally, we use the word ""so-called"" a lot to qualify things, and I know that's something that you've been pushing for in your guidance to journalists?, John Daniszewski: You're trying to balance two things. You're trying to reflect what the group says about themselves, but you don't want them to be alone in branding themselves. You want to be able to, as a journalist, to say exactly what they believe because the label ""alt-right"" can be used to disguise. And you want to pierce that disguise. Again, I think it's the role of the journalist to try to get to the nub of the matter. And the framing sometimes of these events like the so-called free speech demonstration you're talking about, can give it a patina of something that everyone agrees with, when you ... as a journalist knows that there's more behind it than just free speech., Barbara Howard: OK. Thanks so much, John., John Daniszewski: Thank you., Barbara Howard: That's John Daniszewski. He's vice president for Standards at the Associated Press, the AP. He articulates the standards for AP stories that are published in newspapers both here and abroad.,  , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
633,[Reporter's Diary: Forest Bathing To Immerse The Senses ],"[Listen here for an audio version of this story., When it comes to career changes, Nadine Mazzola has made some big leaps. A one-time professional pool player, she took a more traditional turn as a marketing professional. These days, her job is to take people forest bathing., Her latest vocation raises eyebrows. And questions. , ""Is it like yoga class? Is it a stroll in the woods?"" Mazzola said, rattling off the questions people often ask about forest bathing. ""Am I going to take a shower in the woods?"", In a quest for answers I joined a group of forest bathers at Tower Hill Botanic Garden in Boylston. We start by forming a circle in a grassy area just outside a wooded trail head., “Just feel your feet on the ground and look around,” Mazzola urged the group. “Just kind of arrive here.”, No bathing suit or towel required — we are bathing our senses: Listening to the sounds of the meadow, feeling the breeze, and finally opening closed eyes., “Just see what you notice,” said Mazzola., We are ready for the woods, but this is hardly a typical hike. For starters, Mazzola has produced a flute and occasionally lets out a trill. She’s a pied piper of sorts, leading us on a slow-motion journey down the wooded path. On a still summer morning, we’re looking for movement. Taking it in at a trance-like pace, the forest appears surprisingly lively: A tree limb sways slightly, and there’s a tiny ripple of ferns., As a group, we share our observations. It’s this connection that keeps Lisa Mediano coming back., ""You can go to yoga class and say hello and you get your exercise, but you're still within yourself and you're not sharing things,"" said Mediano., Mediano, an attorney from Medford, first experienced forest bathing a few months ago. She says the experience turns a group of strangers into something else., “No matter their educational background, their race, their ethnic group, [forest bathing] just brings out the poetry in people,” said Mediano. “By the end, you’re looking at each individual and saying what a fabulous person, what an inspiring person. You leave with this, kind of like, love. You want to do it again.  And you want to be in nature, because that’s the key.”, Forest bathing isn’t exactly exercise. At one point, we sit next to a tree  — hardly a rigorous undertaking. Yet in Japan, where forest bathing started, doctors discovered it lowers stress hormones and blood pressure. The benefits of being in nature are nothing new. What’s changed is how much time we spend connected to technology. , “I think that’s why forest bathing is so big right now,” said Mazzola, who is a certified forest therapy guide. “We’re feeling the pain of not being in contact with the forest or with nature. There’s really nothing mystical about it. It’s in our bones.”, Mazzola says everyone takes away something unique from forest bathing. For me, it was reminiscent of being a child, essentially playing in the woods. We ended with a tea ceremony. Mazzola laid out a pink cloth, tiny cups and a camping kettle. It could have been a child’s tea party. Even the main ingredient was something a child might choose: Pine needles, a final taste of nature. , Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

We never have the helmets, the sticks; and we engage in dialogue."", Although officials are hoping for the best, they're also planning for the worst. In the event protesters do start to get violent, they will have equipment nearby that they can bring in almost immediately., ""It's a measured approach,"" said Evans. ""It starts very soft and we can pick it up. If things are going to get thrown at us and we're going to get assaulted, then you know I'm not going to leave my officers out there to get injured."", ""What we're saying very clearly here in Boston is: Respect Boston Common; respect the city of Boston,"" said Walsh. ""We don't want and don't need any hateful language used in the city of Boston and, if you're going to do that, don't come to our city."", To watch Jim's full interview with Mayor Marty Walsh and Police Commissioner Bill Evans, including their thoughts on President Donald Trump's recent rhetoric, click on the video player above.]"
640,"[3 Takeaways From The Teamsters, 'Top Chef' Extortion Acquittal  ]","[On Tuesday, a federal jury acquitted all four members of the Boston Teamsters Local 25 union of charges of attempted extortion., The verdict came on the fourth day of deliberation – and after five days of listening to prosecution witnesses who testified that the defendants arrived at a ""Top Chef"" filming location in Milton and assailed the crew with vulgar, racist, and homophobic language, intimidation, and threats., One witness said that shortly after being confronted by two of the teamsters, he found the tires of ""Top Chef"" vehicles had been slashed., But that testimony was not enough to convince the 12-person jury that the government had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt., We don’t know yet what discussions took place among jury members (though we have one or two clues – see below). But there are some likely reasons the case broke the way it did, and they point not only to potential flaws in the case brought by the government – but also, potentially, to a pattern of failed corruption cases brought by United States attorneys in recent years., It may be that jurors reached the same conclusion as Boston attorney Harvey Silverglate who, writing for WGBH News in 2016, suggested that prosecutors were overreaching in charging extortion and engaged in what Silverglate called: ""The recharacterization of local politics as hotbeds of federal fraud."", 1. Being a bully isn’t a felony., Witnesses for the prosecution described Teamsters, often including the defendants specifically, using offensive taunts, threats, and aggressive behavior toward ""Top Chef"" crew members., But, as lawyers for the defense pointed out, the men hadn’t been charged with harassment, or disturbing the peace, or threats, or physical intimidation., Those acts can be crimes, but are usually prosecuted under state laws by county district attorneys – and generally carry far less severe penalties than the felony extortion charges filed against the four Teamsters., The indictment of the four Teamsters described them using “physical violence.” But while there was testimony of “chest bumping” and Teamsters at one point attempting to push their way through the doors of the Steel and Rye Restaurant in Milton - though it was not clear whether any or all of the defendants themselves were present. In any case, witnesses did not describe acts of overt violence., Most of the intimidation described took the form of words: ugly, hurtful, and even hateful words -- but words nonetheless., 2. Advocating for union labor isn’t extortion., Lawyers for the defendants, in contrast to the prosecution, presented no witnesses., The implied message, elaborated in closing remarks, was clear: the burden of proof was on the prosecution and, the defense maintained, prosecutors had failed to prove their case., The picketing of film productions, construction projects, or any other endeavor for not hiring union labor is by itself legal and protected under free speech rights and labor laws., Those laws do not permit violence or other criminal behavior; but neither do individual acts of violent behavior, harassment, or threats by themselves constitute extortion or conspiracy. , In other words, impropriety in advocating a position generally, or advocating for union labor specifically, does not necessarily prove criminal intent. , And it’s here that there could be implications for the upcoming trial of Boston City Hall aides Kenneth Brissette and Timothy Sullivan, separately charged with extortion for allegedly pressuring a concert promoter to hire union labor., Brissette and Sullivan are accused of using their positions to extort on behalf of unions. Yet there is no particular law prohibiting city employees, or the city itself, from encouraging or even requiring union participation in city-funded or city-sponsored events., 3. Conspiracy charges require … well, a conspiracy. , Despite evidence of intimidating behavior by the defendants, there was very little evidence offered showing the defendants actively engaging in any other aspects of the “conspiracy” alleged by prosecutors., Much of the evidence that was offered indicating attempts to convince ""Top Chef"" to hire union members didn’t involve the defendants themselves, and instead involved parties not on trial., That included testimony by one witness who said that Boston tourism director Brissette at one point tried to keep ""Top Chef"" from receiving permits to film in Boston, as well as testimony that Local 25 president Sean O'Brien tried to negotiate with ""Top Chef"" on behalf of his members. , But those men weren't on trial; and testimony didn't directly connect those negotiations to the defendants or their behavior. , There was little direct evidence that any parties were acting on a coordinated plan to force ""Top Chef"" to hire union members. (Indeed, one witness for the prosecution testified to numerous phone calls between the defendants around key timeline events; but defense lawyers pointed out that the defendants had numerous innocuous reasons to be in communication with each other)., On the contrary, testimony of Teamster misbehavior seemed noticeably limited to a few discreet events, especially the notorious day Teamsters disrupted the Milton filming location., But if their actions were meant to precipitate further conversation, there was no testimony to show that., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

646,[Head Of Local Anti-Defamation League: Hate Crimes Are Up In New England],"[Barbara Howard: This is All Things Considered, I'm Barbara Howard. After the violence in Charlottesville, Va. and last night's vandalism at the New England Holocaust memorial in Boston, what were once marginalized groups — the Neo-Nazi sympathizers, Ku Klux Klan and the like — they've been in the headlines in recent days, but how widespread is this phenomenon? With us on the line is Robert Trestan, and he's executive director of the Boston office of the Anti-Defamation League, which among other things, tracks hate crimes. Thanks for joining us, Robert., Robert Trestan: Thanks for having me., Barbara Howard: So, nationally, hate crime statistics are up. How about here in New England?, Robert Trestan: We've seen a marked increase in the last few months of reported hate crimes, and it's important to keep in mind that we're seeing a lot more hate incidents, not all of which rise to the level of a criminal offense. , Barbara Howard: What kind of incidents?, Robert Trestan: Everything from vandalism and graffiti to people being assaulted. It's really across the board. One of the things that we've detected is what I would characterize as sort of the dissemination of messages of hate, and sometimes that's just somebody spray painting a racial epithet or an Islamophobic or anti-Semitic messages in public places or in schools. And sometimes it's just people harassing one another on the street or in the shop or online. , Barbara Howard: Well, news footage of the rallies that we've been seeing show mostly men, mostly young men. Is there a reason for that?, Robert Trestan: Well, the typical offender for a hate crime is usually a white male between 18 and 24 years old. And you know, our televisions and computers were fixated on images over the weekend from Charlottesville, but the majority of hate crimes are not actually committed by organized hate groups. They're usually committed by, you know, individuals who may be inspired or are somehow radicalized by a group or an ideology that go out and feel empowered to target someone or target a group. , Barbara Howard: Well, the vandalism in June at the Holocaust Memorial here in Boston, that was attributed to a man with a history of mental illness, and last night, it allegedly was a teenager from Malden. Now, they seem to have been acting on their own, but then so did that man who drove his car into the anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville where that young woman was killed. What's the role of the internet in inspiring these acts?, Robert Trestan: Well you know, it's hard to predict what motivates an individual person to commit an act, and I think there's some real distinctions between the vandalism to the Holocaust Memorial and driving a car for a crowd of people where, you know, there's an obvious likelihood of death or serious injury, and that's what we saw. Now, the Holocaust Memorial, the police are trying to determine a motive. We know that these individuals, from video, committed the acts, but we're not certain right now exactly what motivated them, so we should be careful about jumping to conclusions without actually having the evidence. , Barbara Howard: Have you been fielding calls about this or are people worried?, Robert Trestan: People are worried and people actually want to do something. And that's one of the unique outcomes of the rise that we've seen in hate incidents, is it's actually bringing more people together. The people who commit these acts or have these beliefs, they don't represent Massachusetts or Boston or even the country, and people of goodwill are uniting around a different message now more than ever. And we saw that with people really wanting to organize around this proposed free speech rally in Boston on Saturday, and we're seeing that now, people rallying, once again — the second time this summer — around damage to the Holocaust memorial. , Barbara Howard: Well, so for those who do want to express themselves in a public way, what are your thoughts, what is your advice and how to conduct yourself at these rallies? , Robert Trestan: My advice is to go to a separate location and let the bigots have their free speech rights. The right to free speech doesn't give you the right to an audience, and the best thing we can do is deprive them of anyone listening to them or paying attention to their message. , Barbara Howard: OK, thanks so much, Robert Trestan., Robert Trestan: Thanks for having me today., Barbara Howard: Robert Trestan is executive director of the Boston office of the Anti-Defamation League, which among other things, tracks hate crimes. This is All Things Considered., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

The driver has been arrested on charges of second degree murder and the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Heyer’s death. As Democrats and Republicans denounced the rally’s bigotry and hatred, President Donald Trump first chose not to directly condemn the white supremacist groups, saying he saw hate and violence on “many sides.” But on Monday, amid mounting pressure, he changed his approach and called the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists “evil.” That denunciation came as organizers were planning similar rallies across the country, including one here in Boston. The events have been billed as free speech rallies, but they look a lot like racist provocations. The event planned for Saturday on the Boston Common has raised questions about who will participate, who will show up to protest, and how the city can keep things from turning violent.

We closed that, because not having the buffets, we don’t have the business,” he said., Like many other seasonal businesses on Cape Cod, Smolowitz depends on seasonal workers who come to the United States specifically for hospitality jobs.

He came to America as a Jewish refugee from the Soviet Union in 1979, with nothing.  But he’s done astoundingly well: he co-founded several successful businesses before becoming a full-time angel investor.  Before starting One Way Ventures, he was the director of Techstars in Boston, a company that connects entrepreneurs with collaborators and investors., , In his time with Techstars he encountered a lot of immigrants who, like him, were natural entrepreneurs. , “There have been many amazing immigrant entrepreneurs that I got to know and I got to help and I got to see succeed,” he says. “In fact, almost all of my most successful company outcomes have been immigrants.”, Dukach says immigrants tend to do well starting businesses because of what they’ve had to go through to make it here. , “People who can get through those difficulties, who can survive that and find a path to success and put themselves somehow in a position of actually building a business and hiring people in the new country… you know those people are much more likely to take that business to a much higher level of success.”, “For the immigrant, there is no safety net and there is no other option,” says Victor Santos, an immigrant founder who is one of the stars of Techstars.  Santos came here from Brazil as a kid.  With the support of Techstars, he and his co-founder Sara Choi created Airfox, a way for low-income people to get online using mobile devices. Airfox serves two million subscribers.  , “I think immigrants have a stronger sense of a mission and purpose in wanting to prove themselves., And I think a lot of it has to do with grit and resilience that comes from being an immigrant and being in an unknown place with a lot of ambiguity,” says Santos. “The number one thing that keeps a company alive is resilience and being comfortable with ambiguity,” he adds with a laugh, because Airfox is living with that ambiguity right now., Santos grew up and went to school here, but he is not a US citizen.  He’s a ‘dreamer’ -- here legally thanks to an executive order signed by President Obama in 2012, known as DACA. As the owner of Airfox, he’s able to sponsor other immigrant workers. But, he explains, “the funny thing about that is, I can't sponsor myself. … Even though I'm I am a DACA recipient, I am the owner of the company, and I own the majority share, so it's not clear that I could do that.”, President Trump has not rescinded DACA, but he has sent mixed signals about how his administration will treat dreamers like Santos., “That's very scary,” he says, “because that could potentially give me, you know, a 90-day notice to leave the country if the program does end.  It's just like purgatory, immigration purgatory.”, , Last week, Trump endorsed a new immigration approach that would reduce legal immigration by introducing merit-based evaluation.  Putting a premium on skills might sound like a wonderful plan for would-be entrepreneurs wanting to come to America. , But Dukach is skeptical., “I'm not sure we should measure the value that human beings bring to us,” he says. “The value of people is their potential, and all people, at the end of the day, given the right environment, have almost infinite potential.”, Dukach says One Way hopes to be backing their first venture by the fall., Arun Rath is the host of WGBH News' All Things Considered. ]"

""There are no new parks. The streets aren't getting wider. We're not increasing public transportation."", “With all of these projects, nothing new is created that makes it more live-able. There are no new parks. The streets aren’t getting wider. We’re not increasing public transportation.”, And then there’s what she calls 'the canyon effect.' Tall and glassy, the city’s newest skyscraper -- the 60-story Millennium Tower -- is a mile away, but clearly visible on a walk down Newbury Street toward the Public Garden., “Before this was open space,” said Smith. “Suddenly, it's blocked in. It changes the view.”, Construction is underway, or about to be, on at least a half dozen buildings that will rival the height of Millennium Tower,  including a new Four Seasons Hotel near the Christian Science Center and a tower planned near Post Office Square. Skyscrapers are also in the works at North Station, South Station and Government Center., “It’s a lot to absorb in a relatively short amount of time,” said Greg Galer of the Boston Preservation Alliance. “It will change the look of the city.”, Galer says his organization welcomes high rise construction if the city’s history remains intact.  He says the Millennium Tower developers struck that balance. They built a skyscraper and restored the century-old building that once housed Filene’s department store in the Downtown Crossing neighborhood. , Yet the break-neck pace of development makes preservation a challenge., ""The next thing you know, you pause for a minute and look back, and what happened?  Where did our historic city go?"" said Galer. ""That's our fear. That in this exuberance, we'll lose the sense of what makes Boston unique."", “The next thing you know, you pause for a minute and look back and what happened?   Where did our historic city go? That’s our fear.  That in this exuberance, we’ll lose the sense of what makes Boston unique.”, The changing skyline may also reflect a changed reality: a city defined less by its history and more by its future., “Boston is a super high-value city,” said George Thrush, a professor of architecture at Northeastern University.  “Boston, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, these are the absolute economic dynamos of the United States.”, Thrush says the thriving economy is attracting new people with new priorities., ""There are people from all over the world living here, there's been a dramatic demographic change,""  said Thrush.  ""They all work in modern industries [and] are much more comfortable with technology, with tall buildings, with all things new."", Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

660,[LISTEN: Jury Deliberations Begin In Top Chef Extortion Trial],"[Susan Kaplan: Jurors are now deliberating in the federal trial of four local Teamsters who are charged with extortion. Prosecutors claim they tried to pressure the TV show ""Top Chef"" into hiring union labor when the show was filming in and around Boston three years ago. Joining us on the line is Isaiah Thompson who's been covering the trial. He's in front of the Moakley Federal Courthouse. Hi, Isaiah., Isaiah Thompson: Hi Susan., Susan Kaplan: So, first of all, can you go over the sequence of events that led to these charges being brought against these four men?, Isaiah Thompson: Yeah. So in a nutshell in 2014, ""Top Chef"" comes to town to film their Boston season. And unlike a lot of other movies and some television productions here, they chose not to hire union labor. The Teamsters caught wind of this and the Teamsters were not happy. There was some back and forth, but ultimately, ""Top Chef"" heard that there was going to be a picket or protest of their show at the Omni Parker. They switch locations at the last minute to a site in Milton, and that's where this sort of notorious incident in the case happens. They're filming, they're approached by a group of Teamsters including the defendants, and then this kind of chaotic scene takes place. So there are different accounts of this, but the Teamsters were protesting, ... hurling extremely vulgar language and offensive language at crew members. There was some testimony that at some point. Some of them may have tried to enter the premises without permission. At one point, one ""Top Chef"" crew member finds the tires of ""Top Chef"" vehicles have been slashed, and there's another moment in which ""Top Chef"" host Padma Lakshmi arrives in a car, [and] is blocked by Teamsters, [and] there's more profanity., , Susan Kaplan: Now, just to get this straight, who are the defendants in this case?, Isaiah Thompson: The defendants are Daniel Redmond, John Fidler, Robert Cafarelli and Michael Ross. They are four members of the Teamsters Local 25, which is based in Charlestown., Susan Kaplan: There doesn't seem to be any question that the defendants used, as you're describing, pretty awful language, including racist and homophobic slurs in dealing with members of the ""Top Chef"" staff, but as you've reported, they're not being charged with harassment or disturbing the peace?, Isaiah Thompson: That's right, and that's what's really central to this case. The defendants have been charged with criminal attempted extortion and conspiracy to commit extortion. What that means is that the government has to prove that this went beyond a really unpleasant protest or even sort of harassment behavior, but that the defendants were doing this as part of a concerted effort to use intimidation, to use the threat of physical violence, to force ""Top Chef"" to hire union labor, namely the Teamsters., Susan Kaplan: How has the defense countered those claims?, Isaiah Thompson: So the defense -- it's interesting -- after five days of witnesses for the prosecution, the defense for all four of the men rested without presenting any witnesses of their own. And essentially what they were saying with this to the jury was, you may have heard a lot of unpleasant things here, but you have not heard proof of criminal extortion; you have not heard proof of what the government is claiming here. In their closing remarks, lawyers for the defendants basically said, look, what you had here was you had a group of union members staging a protest, because they were upset that ""Top Chef"" hadn’t hired union labor, and in protesting, if that's indeed what they were doing, is within their rights. [It] is within their free speech rights, and it's protected under labor laws., Susan Kaplan: The only people on trial right now are these four Teamsters. But this case could have implications for the case of two Boston City Hall aides who were indicted in a separate case?, Isaiah Thompson: Yeah, that's right. And you know, I want to be very careful here and emphasize again -- the only people on trial right now are the four defendants in this case. But, this case does potentially touch on the case of two city hall aides who were indicted, also charged with attempted extortion on behalf of unions. There was some testimony presented in this trial that indicated that Kenneth Brissette -- who is one of the two city all aides indicted in a separate case -- that Kenneth Brissette was involved in some capacity in this dispute. One witness testified that Brissette had told him not to give permits to ""Top Chef"" after this labor dispute erupted., Susan Kaplan: OK, thanks for joining us, Isaiah., Isaiah Thompson: Thanks for having me., Susan Kaplan. That’s WGBH Radio's Isaiah Thompson joining us from outside Boston's Moakley Federal Courthouse. He's been covering the trial of those four Teamsters charged with extortion for allegedly trying to pressure the TV show ""Top Chef"" into hiring union labor while it filmed in and around Boston. ,  ]"

663,[Former EPA Head Raises Concerns About Trump's Stance On Climate Change],"[“We're feeling it today,” former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy said about the effects of climate change, when she joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston Thursday. “We can see that the last decades have been warmer than the last 1,200 years. There’s no hiding this."", “I think the real challenge is that people are a little bit complacent about that,” added McCarthy, who served under President Barack Obama. “They see the climate changing, but the climate isn't about polar bears. I mean, I like polar bears, but it's about our kids and their future. This is serious stuff.”, McCarthy joined Braude a few days after a draft government report on climate change started gaining widespread attention. The 545-page report, put together by a panel of scientists from 13 federal agencies, paints a dire picture of the effects of climate change across the country. According to The New York Times, several scientists involved raised concerns that the Trump Administration might try to censor it., “They [the scientists] wanted to definitely call attention to it before decisions got made, so people could see what it actually said, based on the science,” McCarthy said. “They have an administration that has denied climate science. It's taken climate science off the EPA webpage. It's looking to get rid of scientists and not invest in science because, apparently, they're not giving them the answers they need.”, This latest report undercuts many of the administration’s recent claims about climate trends, particularly because it points to humans and greenhouse gasses as the main cause of increased temperatures, rising sea levels and more incidents of extreme weather across the country., “We’ll have to wait and see what they do,” said McCarthy, referring to whether the White House will ultimately sign off on the draft and officially release it. “But this report is pretty clear, and it is moving in the same direction as the science we knew before. It's just even stronger today.”, When President Trump first took office, McCarthy offered to help her successor, current EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, as nearly all outgoing cabinet secretaries do., “I’m no longer holding my breath,” said McCarthy when asked if she thought Pruitt might ever reach out to her for that guidance. Still, she was optimistic about the nation’s future in clean energy investment., “No president is going to turn around the energy market because he makes an announcement … and that's what they're essentially trying to say,” McCarthy said, referring to the president’s push to bring back the US coal industry and his decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement. “The future is clean energy. Businesses tried to tell them that."" , She added, ""The international community recognizes that it's an embarrassment that we're not there, but the energy train's left the station, there's no way it's going to go back.”]"

667,[Private Events Conflict With Public Access At The Boston Waterfront],"[It was a perfectly beautiful summer night on the Boston waterfront, and a group from the Conservation Law Foundation and some of their supporters walked along the public path known as the Harborwalk. But as the group walked up to the Institute of Contemporary Art, they found their path blocked by a metal barrier., On the other side, hundreds of people, mostly in dressy all-white outfits, chatted and sipped cocktails. , “Can we go in here?” Deanna Moran of CLF asked a security guard stationed there., “No,"" he said. ""You have to go inside and talk to one of the one of the staff members in there.”, “OK. So the Harborwalk is closed right now?” Moran asked. The security guard looked a little flummoxed and grabbed his radio, asking for someone to come to the gate., , The ICA was the last stop on a sort of travelling picnic along the waterfront the CLF group did on this evening to illustrate a point – that these spots, even though it might not always seem like it -- especially those in front of swanky hotels and luxury condos -- are open to the public, by state law., , After a while, ICA Director of Events Hannah Gathman greeted the CLF group. Gathman explained that this was the museum’s monthly summer ""First Fridays"" event. The ICA does host a number of events in the public space here that are free and open to the public. But this one cost $20 for non-members., The property on the other side of the ICA is under construction, interrupting the continuous Harborwalk, and Gathman said that’s why the public path around the museum is shut down., “Then why can people access the Harborwalk during the day when you're not having an event?” Moran asked., “I don't know,"" Gathman replied. ""I'm sorry I don't have a better answer for that.”, , Moran asked if the ICA had prior authorization from the state's Department of Environmental Protection, which is responsible for the Harborwalk, to have a private event there. Gathman said she didn't know., The answer is no. The DEP did not give the ICA permission to shut the Harborwalk down., “It's an example of encroaching privatization we're seeing, where what's public by law is becoming private in practice,” said Brad Campbell, president of the Conservation Law Foundation. Campbell called their picnic event on public spaces an ""act of civil obedience."", “Whether it's for a private event or for the operation of a private bar or restaurant, areas are either being closed off or they look as though they are closed off,” he said., Earlier in the evening, the CLF group had stopped by a bar outside the Intercontinental Hotel that the DEP says violates public open space laws. And CLF has filed a lawsuit against a group of developers and the DEP for another waterfront project they say has an inadequate public access plan., Ben Lynch heads the DEP’s waterways regulation program. He said most waterfront developments willingly meet the public space requirements. And he says when new developments are approved, the public access issue is not negotiable., “By statute we have to, in order to issue a license for them for a developer to be able to build, the public benefits have to outweigh the private benefits of any site,"" Lynch said. ""And one of the first, probably the first and most important part of any license, is that there be good 24-hour public access.”, Lynch said his office has heard from CLF about the ""First Fridays"" event at the ICA., , “We will be reaching out to ICA to revisit this issue to make sure that in the future when they want to do these kinds of events that they seek the written approval of the department,"" he said. ""And I should add that were we to give that approval, we would never give the approval to close off the Harborwalk. The Harborwalk is sacrosanct. The Harborwalk has to stay open.”, In response to an inquiry from WGBH News, the ICA responded with a written statement saying the museum has and will continue to provide public access during ICA events, and that they’ve met with security staff to make sure public access is maintained. , When asked if that will include future ""First Fridays"" events, they said yes. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
668,"[Teamsters, ""Top Chef"" Extortion Trial Goes To The Jury]","[UPDATED: 5 pm , The case against four members of the Boston Teamsters Local 25 is now the hands of a federal jury., Daniel Redmond, John Fidler, Robert Cafarelli and Michael Ross are accused of attempting to extort the reality show ""Top Chef""when it didn't hire union labor for its 2014 Boston season., Federal prosecutors and lawyers for the defendants offered their closing statements this morning. Federal Judge Douglas Woodlock has instructed the jury and the 12 jurors are now deliberating., Prosecutors said that the days of testimony describing the show's crew being assailed by Teamsters with offensive language and threats – proves that the defendants used violent intimidation to try to force the show to hire union labor it didn't want or need., “This was not a negotiation, or a picket, or a demonstration,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Kristina Barclay told the jury. “This was four men threatening to cause physical harm to the crew of Top Chef in order to get wages, jobs – wages for unwanted and superfluous services. And that is extortion.”, Lawyers for the four defendants countered that while their clients behavior may not have been pleasant, they were staging a lawful protest of the show's employment practices when it came to union labor – and not attempting to extort jobs., Defense attorney Oscar Cruz, who is representing defendant Daniel Redmond, pointed to testimony by one ""Top Chef"" official who said he had been willing to pay some amount of money to the Teamsters just to keep them away from the set – but not to hire them., “The Teamsters were not interested in a payoff,” Cruz said. “In other words [the Teamsters were saying], 'Let's do this above-board. And if you're not going to do that, guess what? We're going to picket you. We're going to demonstrate against a non-union company that's not willing to hire union drivers.”, The testimony of the apparent failed negotiation marked the most significant moment in the trial that could potentially inform another impending trial: that of Kenneth Brissette and Timony Sullivan, both senior members of the administration of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. Brissette and Sullivan are charged with attempted extortion for allegedly using their offices to pressure the ""Boston Calling"" concert series into hiring union labor., Witness Derek Cunningham, a location scout for ""Top Chef"", testified that he had been in communication with Brissette about the simmering labor dispute and that Brissette had told him at one point not to hand over permits for ""Top Chef""., Published Earlier: 3 Things To Watch For , Today, a jury will hear closing arguments in the case against four members of the Boston-based Teamsters Local 25 union charged with conspiracy to extort the reality TV show ""Top Chef""., The case, which has proceeded over nearly two weeks in federal court, has featured extensive testimony describing Teamsters members approaching ""Top Chef"" staff as they began to set up for the filming of the show’s 2014 “Boston” season – and especially an incident in which Teamsters arrived at a filming location in Milton and disrupted production., According to more than a half-dozen witnesses for the prosecution, Teamsters on the scene assailed the crew with vulgar, homophobic, and racist language, as well as threats of violence., One witness for the prosecution, a ""Top Chef"" production assistant, described having an encounter with two teamsters while removing identifying placards from ""Top Chef"" vehicles, only to find the tires of those vehicles slashed shortly thereafter., But the defendants are not charged with harassment or disturbing the peace – they’re charged with conspiracy to commit extortion, and it is on these charges that the case will hinge., Here are a few points to follow as both the prosecution and defense make their closing arguments today:, Racketeering or lawful (if ugly) protest?, Lawyers for the defendants have not, by and large, contested the idea that members of the Teamsters Union who showed up to picket the Top Chef filming location were aggressive or that they used vulgar and offensive language., But they have argued that the Teamsters had a constitutional right to picket the show for not hiring union labor and to express their free speech rights., “Conspiracy” Means a Plot – Not a Reaction, The defendants are charged with ‘conspiracy’ to extort the Top Chef crew. That would seem to mean a jury would have to find that the defendants’ actions were more than an angry reaction to the show’s not hiring union members. Instead, the defendants must be shown to have been intentionally coordinating to use threats and intimidation (even, as the government alleges, physical violence) to extract a wanted outcome: in this case, jobs., Which Teamster? , There is some reason to believe this case will hinge less on the more nuanced questions around the line between lawful labor actions and conspiracy to extort than a much simpler question: Whether the jury will find that the four men in the courtroom have been sufficiently identified by witnesses as participants in the alleged crime., There are four defendants – but several witnesses described between 6 and 12 teamsters on the scene. And there has been precious little testimony connecting the alleged criminal acts to the Teamsters in the courtroom., One defendant, John Fidler, has been positively identified by witnesses; but most defendants have not, and it’s possible that this case will turn less on the line between lawful protest and a crime than the simple lack of evidence tying individual defendants to the crimes alleged., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

670,[LISTEN: What Rep. Niki Tsongas's Decision To Leave Congress Means For Massachusetts],"[Susan Kaplan: Congresswoman Niki Tsongas, announcing today that she will not seek reelection next year. Tsongas represents Massachusetts 3rd District which covers portions of Worcester, Essex and Middlesex Counties including her home of Lowell. Tsongas has served in Congress since 2007 when she won a special election to fill the seat of Marty Meehan who resigned to become the chancellor of UMass Lowell. He now leads the whole UMass system. Tsongas was the wife of the late Paul Tsongas who himself represented Massachusetts in the House and then the Senate. He died in 1997. Joining us now on the line to take a look at Tsongas’ time in Congress is WGBH News contributor David Bernstein. Hi David., David Bernstein: Hi. How are you, Susan?, Susan Kaplan: Good, thank you. So why has Congresswoman Tsongas chosen not to run for a new term?, David Bernstein: Well we don't really know. She put out a statement that really didn't say much other than, you know, that she's enjoyed her time in Congress and she thinks that this is the right time. But, there was always a sense that she would not necessarily hold that seat for a very long time. She was already over 60 at the time. She seems very healthy and spirited when I've seen her over the last couple of years. It did take a lot of people by surprise who I've talked to today, but she seems to be ready to move on to something else., Susan Kaplan: What has she accomplished during her tenure in Congress? What's her track record?, David Bernstein: The thing that she's probably best known for is her work on sexual assault in the military. She's really been a leading voice on providing oversight, adding some legislation and also sort of forcing it as an issue from her seat on the Armed Services Committee. I would also point to work she's done on the environmental issues: conservation, rivers, and preservation of species and so forth. I've talked to her a number of times over the years on that, and she's really very passionate about it., Susan Kaplan: How has she done with her constituents?, David Bernstein: She was elected with some votes from all around the district and she ended up being very very popular [and] has only gotten token opposition in recent years., Susan Kaplan: What about her legacy — what do you think that will be?, David Bernstein: Well, she's always going to be mixed up and caught up with the legacy of her husband Paul Tsongas, the late Paul Tsongas, who is sort of legendary in Massachusetts. You know, senator, ran for president, was really a big name in the state and she's always to some extent going to be looked at as the widow of and she understands that, she accepts that as part of her legacy. But I think if you look around Lowell and the rest of that district, there's a lot that's changed for the better in those cities and towns that I think she can take some credit for., Susan Kaplan: Who do you see running for her seat in next year's election?, David Bernstein: There are a lot of names being talked about including several of the people who lost to Niki Tsongas back in that 2007 special election. Eileen Donahue, who was the mayor of Lowell and is now a state senator. Jamie Eldridge, who is another state senator who was a state representative at the time. Also possibly Steve Kerrigan who looked at running back then and, I'm told, will be looking at it again. But there are also a number of younger folks around the district: state representatives, mayors, a lot of interesting and diverse faces around the district. And of course several Republicans who will take a look at the race too., Susan Kaplan: What if any impact does this have on the wider election in Massachusetts next year. Governor Baker will be seeking re-election as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren and now there will be a contest for the open seat in the U.S. House., David Bernstein: That's right. And in some ways, the House race will be down ballot and impacted by those big marquee statewide races. But I can also see it working the other way around where there could be a lot of interest in this race for who's going to win this congressional seat. And that could actually drive a lot of turnout that could affect those top of the ballot races. I think you're going to see a lot of interest in the primaries on both sides. And I think the primary on the Republican side in this race as well as the statewide Senate race could end up being something of a proxy for this sort of “Charlie Baker, moderate, anti-Trump"" Republicans versus the sort of more conservative, more pro-Trump Republicans. I think you could see that playing out in the primaries. Who wins that will determine what the race looks like in the general election., Susan Kaplan: OK, well thanks for joining us, David., David Bernstein: My pleasure., Susan Kaplan: That's WGBH News contributor David Bernstein.

Clay walked out of Suffolk Superior Court yesterday after a judge vacated his conviction for the 1979 shooting death of Jeffrey Boyajian, a cab driver who was shot in the head five times during a robbery. At the time, witnesses identified Clay as the shooter, but after a review of the case, prosecutors determined those accounts were flawed.

672,[Rep. Seth Moulton On North Korea And His Future (Non)Presidential Plans],"[“It's a little frightening when you have a commander-in-chief and a secretary of state who are clearly not on the same page,” Congressman Seth Moulton told Jim Braude on Greater Boston., The comment came a day after President Trump declared North Korea “will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen” if the nation attacks the U.S. or its allies. Moulton, who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, raised serious concerns about the ongoing showdown., “I agree with Senator McCain, who said that this kind of rhetoric is dangerous,” he said. “It's dangerous for our national security, it's dangerous for Americans and our troops in Seoul. The tough part of this is that there is no military solution …. We cannot just take out the North Korean nuclear arsenal without them launching an artillery attack that would literally kill tens of thousands of Americans — hundreds of thousands of South Koreans — on the first day.”, , “Donald Trump is a chickenhawk,” Moulton went on. “He took five deferments — privileged deferments — so that some child of a working family could go instead to serve in his place in Vietnam; and now he's acting as a tough guy on the international stage. When you act as a tough guy as the commander-in-chief, threatening military options that are not good military options, then people don't believe you.”, Some of Trump’s detractors have used the terms “unstable” or “unhinged” in relation to the president in recent weeks — descriptors that go a bridge too far for Moulton right now. But he did express other concerns., “I would certainly say erratic, uncontrolled emotions, someone who cannot be trusted,” said Moulton. “I mean we literally can't trust him to speak the truth every single day. And, you know, that's frightening in a military commander …. integrity is so important when it comes to our national security. You have to trust what someone says. People can't trust Donald Trump.”, When asked about the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in our election and whether the president obstructed justice, Moulton warned he is not a lawyer, but made his opinion on the matter clear., “I believe, from what I've heard from what I've seen, that he has absolutely tried to obstruct this investigation and that he has done things that fundamentally are ... hurtful to our own country,” Moulton said. “If you collude with our greatest enemy of the last 65 years to try to get yourself elected, that's something that, just in principle, you should be impeached for.”, As for his own future plans and a lengthy recent profile in Politico claiming he is considering his own run for president, Moulton denied the claim., “I am not running,” he said, with a smile on his face, as Braude pressed him on the issue. “I’m going to Iowa [and the Democrats’ Polk County Steak Fry] because I'm going to tap into the tremendous activism that is in Iowa and can help us win in 2018 to restore some balance to Washington, to get people in public office who deserve to be there, because we're going to put the country first.”, To see Jim's full interview with Congressman Seth Moulton, click on the video link above., Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"

679,"[Convicted at age 16, man freed 38 years later as innocent man]","[Thirty-eight years after being convicted for a murder based in part on witness testimony given under hypnosis, Frederick Clay walked out of Suffolk Superior Court on Tuesday a free man. , Clay, who was barely 16 when he was first arrested, was released after the Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office vacated his conviction determining that it “cannot say with sufficient certainty that justice was done.” Clay, now 53, hugged his attorney and told the court he was innocent of the crime. , He emerged from a courtroom into the arms of his supporters and attorneys. “No amount of apologies is going to bring back 38 years of my life,” he said. “But I would say if they would recognize I am innocent as opposed to recognizing that I just didn’t get a fair trial, that’s what I was hoping for, actual innocence. The basis of me being free is I am actually innocent.” Clay said he was eager to visit the grave of his mother and was also hungry for a steak and cheese sandwich. “I’ve been locked up since I was 16, now I am 53 so there’s a lot of life I gotta make up on,” he said. , The state motion says that “after scrupulous examination of the evidence,” and “unusual circumstances of the defendant’s trial,” including evidence that eyewitnesses were hypnotized, prosecutors supported Clay’s motion to a new trial. Prosecutors then said they wouldn’t file a new motion to prosecute. , The victim’s brother, Jerry Boyajian, expressed support for the decision. “Because of his testimony at the hearing, I began to doubt what he (Clay) did,” Boyajian said. “He needed to live the rest of his life as a free man.” , Clay’s case is the first one vacated by the Suffolk County’s so-called Conviction Integrity Program, a panel created in 2012 to “identify and correct past wrongful convictions” and prevent future ones. At least 225 inmates have had their cases overturned by some 29 similar programs based out of prosecutors’ office across the country, according to the National 
Registry of Exonerations at the University of California, Irvine. , The number of “integrity” units has grown to at least 29 nationwide and are responsible for an increasing number of exonerations, 70 in 2016 alone, according to the registry. Jake Wark, a spokesman for the District Attorney’s office, said while Clay’s case is the first to be examined by the new integrity unit it is at least the fifth conviction to be reversed after a post-conviction investigation during District Attorney Daniel F. Conley’s administration. , “As prosecutors our duty is to the interest of justice and not to convictions,” he said.  “If there is a reasonable doubt that a jury might have reached a different conclusion with all the facts available to them it is our obligation to reverse that conviction.” Clay sought to open his case last year, alleging among other things that new research poked holes in the eyewitness evidence against him. , He was convicted of a November 1979 murder of a Boston taxi cab driver, Jeffrey Boyajian. Prosecutors offered no physical evidence to convict him, instead depending on the testimony of two eye witnesses whose identification was aided by hypnosis. Clay already was supposed to be released this month following a Supreme Judicial Court in August 2016 that ruled that his constitutional rights were violated when the Massachusetts Parole Board applied rules from a 2012 law to him requiring a super majority of the board to release him. , In 2015, four parole members voted in favor of his parole. Clay’s attorney Lisa Kavanaugh said that she filed the motion to re-open Clay’s case, because although he was already getting out, he deserved to leave an innocent man. “Being on parole for the rest of his life for a crime he didn’t commit seemed like a gross injustice to me,” said Kavanaugh, director of the Innocence Program at the state Committee for Public Counsel Services. , Kavanaugh is pushing for passage of state legislation that would provide immediate financial help to people who were wrongfully convicted. Currently under state law, men and women whose convictions were overturned have to prove their innocence by “clear and convincing” evidence before accessing up to $500,000 in compensation, a process that can take years. , Clay, she said, will be leaving with about $1,000 he has earned while incarcerated and another $2,000 provided to him by a private fund for the wrongfully convicted. “This person, who has been in prison since he was a teenager, has no job experience and no education,’’ she said. “When people get out of prison they have immediate needs.” , Clay is the second Massachusetts man in two days to have his murder conviction vacated after Norfolk County prosecutors filed a motion Monday to not re-try 
Frederick Weichel for a 1980 murder in Braintree unless new evidence surfaces. , NECIR intern Ines Kagubare contributed to this report.    , Jenifer B.

680,"[Defense In Teamsters, 'Top Chef' Trial Rests Without Offering Witnesses ]","[
	Testimony in the federal extortion case against four members of Boston's Teamsters Local 25 union ended Tuesday when lawyers for each of the defendants rested their case without calling any witnesses of their own.
	 
	The move comes after a steady stream of witnesses testified for the prosecution, largely presenting variations of the same story: That Teamsters harassed and threatened ""Top Chef"" crew members as they filmed the show's 2014 “Boston” season., 
	Central to the government's case was an incident in June, 2014 in which Teamsters showed up at a filming location, the Steel and Rye restaurant in Milton and allegedly disrupted the production by attempting to force their way on set, assailing the crew with vulgar, homophobic and racist language, blocking vehicles from entering the set and even slashing the tires of ""Top Chef"" vehicles.
	 
	""Top Chef"" host Padma Lakshmi took the stand Monday, testifying that Teamsters blocked her car and that she feared for her safety and the safety of her crew.  , 
	Lawyers for the four defendants cross-examined those witnesses, focusing less on what they did see than what they did not: There was no witness to the tire-slashing, for example., 
	And while many witnesses described Teamsters using crude language and issuing verbal threats – and, in some cases, feeling physically threatened – they did not describe overt acts of physical violence., 
	By declining to present witnesses of their own, or having their clients take the stand, lawyers for the defense are likely preparing to argue either that the acts the government describes do not constitute the crime for which they are being tried – conspiracy to commit extortion., 
	Lawyers for the defendants have argued that the men have rights, constitutionally and under labor laws, to picket and advocate on behalf of their members for jobs. And the men are not being accused of lesser crimes like harassment or disturbing the peace., 
	However, the defense could also lean heavily on another angle: For all the testimony offered by prosecutors, there were very few instances in which witnesses were able to positively identify the individual defendants., 
	In fact, witnesses variously described a group of between about a half dozen to a dozen Teamsters on the scene, and were often hazy in their recollection of which individuals engaged in what behavior. When presented with a photo-lineup by FBI agents while the incident was under investigation, many witnesses were unable to identify the defendants., 
	Probably less germane to the outcome of this case was testimony offered by prosecution witnesses involving exchanges between a show location scout and then City of Boston Tourism chief Kenneth Brissette., 
	Brissette has been charged with extortion in a separate case, along with City Hall senior aide Timothy Sullivan. The city hall aides are accused of conspiring to withhold permits for events, including ""Top Chef"" and the ""Boston Calling"" music festival, if the productions didn't hire union labor., 
	The location scout, Derek Cunninghan, testified that Brissette had told him not to hand over permits that had already been issued to ""Top Chef"" after Teamsters approached members of the show., 
	The case against Brissette and Sullivan has yet to go to trial., 
	Closing arguments in the Teamsters case are scheduled for Thursday., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

683,"[In wake of immigration crackdown, some New England jails see brisk business]","[Six months since President Donald Trump ratcheted up immigration enforcement, some local jails in New England are doing a brisk business housing immigrants arrested by federal agents. , Nearly all five county jails in Massachusetts and New Hampshire that detain immigrants facing possible deportation are filling up beds in increasing numbers and watching millions of dollars more pour in from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, according to data recently obtained by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. , 
 , More than 600 immigrants are detained in the county-run jails, a 28 percent increase over last year. , Immigrants held in these jails in New England also spend an average of 81 days locked up, significantly more time than the national average of 43 days in detention, according to ICE. , While counties see increased revenue under Trump’s new policies, immigrant families face an economic struggle when the breadwinner in the family is locked up, said immigrant rights advocates in Boston. , Last year, while Obama was still president, officials in Strafford County, N.H., spent $450,000 to create a new housing unit that could take in more immigrant detainees. , Like most of the five county jails in New England that contract with ICE, numbers and revenue are up. Strafford saw money from ICE climb 50 percent – to $1.6 million – in the first half of this year compared to last year. , Ray Bower, the Strafford County manager, said the jail is just meeting a rising demand and not the ones responsible for arresting more immigrants. , “We don’t bring anybody in. While our sheriff’s department might transport them, we don’t initiate the custody,” said Bower. , His county gets paid $83 a day to lock up an immigrant arrested by ICE. Nearly a quarter of the jail’s annual budget is covered from ICE revenue. , “We treat ICE as our customers. We wanted to provide them a full service so there’s no incentive for us because we don’t have any authority to take anyone in custody. We simply manage those people that are delivered to us,” added Bower. , Oscar Gutierrez landed in the Strafford County jail on May 16 when a father-son fishing trip to the seacoast in Hampton Beach, N.H. with his 4-year-old boy, Felipe, turned bad. , Oscar’s wife, Mirna Gutierrez, 8 ½ months pregnant, was waiting for them in the car, knitting, when she saw something wrong with Felipe. , “When I see him come back, running and all scared, I said ‘What’s happening?’” said Mirna Gutierrez, speaking through an interpreter. “’My father was caught by police.’” 
,  Oscar Gutierrez’s violation was fishing without a license. Many offenders pay a $93 fine or get off with a warning. The officer worked for the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department and called ICE when Gutierrez couldn’t produce a valid identification. ,  Gutierrez is a 31-year-old immigrant from Honduras, who reentered the United States after being deported in 2005. His wife is a U.S. citizen and begged the state officer not to call ICE. ,  “I showed him my photo I.D., my American passport, my social security number, and I told him ‘I am going to give birth any time, please don’t take him,’” said Mirna Gutierrez. ,  But her pleas failed to dissuade the New Hampshire officer. Oscar Gutierriez said the officer detained him for about an hour, waiting for ICE agents. ,  “When immigration came, he was handcuffed at the legs and wrist,” said Mirna Gutierrez. “Felipe came and said ‘please don’t take my Daddy away.’” ,  Whether police should cooperate with ICE – as they did in New Hampshire with Gutierrez – is fueling a regional debate. A week after the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that local cops don’t have the authority to detain immigrants for ICE, Gov. Charlie Baker pushed back with legislation to let law enforcement hold immigrants with prior convictions of felonies, domestic violence or gang-related crimes. ,  While the Baker bill focuses on immigrants with serious criminal records, ICE continues targeting all undocumented immigrants. In a three-month period this year, ICE arrested 335 non-criminal immigrants in New England, more than triple the number caught in the same three months last year. ,  Elena Noureddine, the director of the detention program at the PAIR Project in Boston, is seeing the impact as her advocates visit immigrants in Bristol, Plymouth and Suffolk county jails. ,  “The people that we’re meeting with now have a really, really difficult time being detained and the first thing they tell me is like ‘I’ve never been in jail before,’” she said. ,  ICE has not explained why detainees in New England spend a longer stretch of time in jail than the national average. ,  There are several ways that immigrant detainees can leave the jail. They can be deported or released on bond or let free because they have a strong case for citizenship. There’s also a process called habeas corpus if they are held beyond a reasonable amount of time with no movement in their case. ,  Some immigrant detainees just give up, said Noureddine. ,  “They often go to their first immigration hearing and they tell the judge like ‘I just want a deportation order please send me back as soon as possible’ even if they escaped horrible harm but because they’re feeling like they’re being treated is if they had committed a crime and they just can’t deal with being confined,” she said. ,  For many immigrant breadwinners who are detained in jails leads, the length of time creates even more economic hardship., Mirna Gutierrez worried how she would pay the rent and buy food when her husband, Oscar, was arrested. He works in the construction industry as a sheet-rocker, and is the family’s sole source of income. , The Strafford County jail in Dover doesn’t see any legal aid lawyers visiting the facility like Noureddine’s PAIR Project. , Oscar Gutierrez was detained there for five weeks, full of worry for his wife who had brain surgery last year and suffers seizures. The birth was difficult. And Oscar Gutierrez wasn’t there to help. , “I was destroyed,” said Oscar Gutierrez. “It was really hard. You want to be there at that moment. Those are the best moments in life.” , As Gutierrez relived this painful moment, his eyes well up with tears. Felipe came closer to his father and leaned in to comfort him. Their future is uncertain. Gutierrez’s lawyer, Paulo Moura, convinced ICE officials to issue a humanitarian stay on his deportation. The next hearing is 10 months away. , A version of this story aired on WGBH public radio August 7, 2017.]"
684,[Judge asks jurors in 1985 murder case about bias allegations],"[More than 30 years after a Plymouth County jury found 19-year-old Darrell Jones guilty of a Brockton murder, three jurors appeared in court Tuesday to answer allegations that the conviction may have been tainted by racism. , The highly unusual hearing marked what appears to be the first time a Massachusetts jury had been summoned back to court, following a March US Supreme Court ruling finding that a trial judge must pry into jury deliberations — typically kept secret — if there is evidence of racial bias. , Last month, Superior Court Justice Thomas McGuire Jr. summoned jurors in the 1985 case after allegations from one member of the all-white panel. That juror, Eleanor Urbati, asserted that two members of the jury said on the first day of deliberations that they thought Jones was guilty because he was black. , Her allegations were first aired in a 
2016 investigative report on Jones’s innocent plea published by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting and WBUR publc radio. Jones was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. He has maintained his innocence in the death of alleged Cuban cocaine dealer Guillermo Rodriguez, and in 2015 he filed a motion to reopen his conviction., On Tuesday, the jurors, one limping and barely able to walk, told McGuire they couldn’t remember whether or not bias was present in their deliberations. Too much time had passed, they said. “I don’t remember, I don’t remember anything,’’ said Maureen Bates, the first juror to testify during the hearing. “I think it’s [been] too long.” , Urbati, 81, did not attend the hearing. Contacted Tuesday evening at home, the Hingham woman said she never received the summons and would have showed up if asked. Urbati has said she was the last holdout and that she regrets succumbing to pressure to convict him. “I remember that distinctly. They had him guilty right from the beginning because he was black,’’ she said. “I am old but I am not stupid.” , McGuire is considering whether to solicit more input from jurors before ruling on Jones’s motion. Jones alleges that police tampered with a videotaped interview of a key witness shown at his trial to remove evidence that could prove his innocence. He also said that his lawyer, now deceased, failed to adequately represent him by, among other things, forcing him to sit in a so-called “prisoner’s dock” 10 feet behind him, rather than beside him. Jessica Kenny, a Plymouth County assistant district attorney, said Tuesday that Jones has not presented any new evidence to prove his innocence, and she urged McGuire to reject his motion. , The Supreme Court’s decision involved the case of Miguel Angel Pena Rodriguez, a Colorado man who appealed his 2007 conviction for unlawful sexual contact after learning a juror had said he thought Pena Rodriguez was guilty because he was Mexican and “Mexican men take whatever they want.” , McGuire, who is now presiding in Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River, is hearing Jones’s case because he was seated in Plymouth when the motion was first filed. He said in court that he was “required” to question jurors after being made aware of allegations of racial bias, following the top court ruling and a similar 2010 holding from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. McGuire said the courts have ruled that although juror deliberations should be private and confidential, questions of racial bias must be addressed. , “This is a very unusual situation,’’ he told the jurors. “I just want to find out what the truth is.” McGuire said the court had attempted to reach all the jurors but wasn’t sure if all of them had been contacted. , Pamela Wood, the state’s jury commissioner, said she had never heard of jurors being asked to discuss their deliberations decades after a conviction. “To bring in jurors, I’m not aware of that happening,’’ she said. “I have faith in the court system and the judge if they made the determination this is the effective way to make a decision.” At the same time, “memories fade,” she said. , Howard Friedman, a Boston civil rights attorney, said the hearing was remarkable, but questioned whether jurors would remember bias after so much time. , Yet he praised the judge for taking the allegations seriously. “Fairness should have no time limit,” he said. During the nine-day trial, prosecutors provided no motive and no physical evidence linking him to the crime. None of the eyewitnesses testified they were sure Jones was the shooter. Jones, who sat with his lawyers during testimony, made an emotional plea at the end of the hearing for the judge to rule on his motion quickly. , He said previous hearings on his case had already established his right to a new trial. Pointing to relatives in the room, including his 73-year-old mother, who had traveled to Massachusetts from Virginia, Jones said he was ready for a decision. “I don’t want to wait another week. I don’t want to wait another day,’’ he said. And speaking to his family, feeling vindicated that he had proved his case: “Even if we lost, we won.” , This story co-published with the

685,[LISTEN: Clover Founder On Why The Food Trucks Are Coming Off The Streets],"[Susan Kaplan: This is All Things Considered, I'm Susan Kaplan. Clover, the self-styled food lab that's been serving up chick pea fritters, barbecued seitan, and other healthy, tasty fast food in and around Boston for the better part of a decade now, is putting its food trucks back in the garage. Clover’s brick and mortar restaurants aren't going anywhere, but today was the last day that its trucks were out on the streets. Here to explain the decision is Clover founder, Ayr Muir. Thanks for joining us, Ayr., Ayr Muir: Thank you., Susan Kaplan: So food trucks are how you got started back in 2008 and droves of hungry people have been flocking to your trucks in Dewey Square and on Newbury Street for years now. Why are you stopping?, Ayr Muir: Well it's bittersweet, for sure. We first served out of a food truck in late 2008 when I had this crazy idea of trying to serve vegetables to carnivores. I thought it was exciting, but I didn't know if it would work. So I wasn't confident enough to open a whole restaurant. So, for us, initially, it was a way to test our menu. But we loved the truck so much we ended up keeping them open and expanding them to the point where we were operating seven. We had the biggest fleet in the country at one point. But we're moving on now to a new stage in the company., Susan Kaplan: Well, did you build the first clover food truck yourself?, Ayr Muir: It's true. The first truck — I actually would park it over in the Home Depot parking lot because I kept getting sick of running back and forth for things I'd forgotten in there., Susan Kaplan: So you mean it was breaking?, Ayr Muir: Well I was building it — I was cutting out the side of it and doing the plumbing. I don't know if you've done a home renovation project, but I always forget and have to run back and forth the pick up parts, so I just parked it in the parking lot and turned on the generator and I was working on it there. But yeah, the first truck I built myself. I think that my employees all loved it once we got one built by a professional with truck number two and three and so on., Susan Kaplan: But the first one — what's going to happen to that, the original? Going in a museum?, Ayr Muir: Well I am a little attached to it so, you figured me out there. We’re saving that truck. We're going to save two of them. We have a number of events we do and catering and we're not going to stop that. So we'll keep two trucks to keep supporting those things, and truck No. 1, the one I built, will be one of those two that we keep., Susan Kaplan: As you just said, you know, Clover's food trucks were some of the first food trucks to hit the streets in and around Boston, so I'm wondering what you think is the difference about running a food truck now versus nine years ago, because I imagine some of those differences are part of the reason why you're stopping., Ayr Muir: Yeah, for us the food truck was sort of an accidental thing. We started it to try to test our menu and, people don't remember this, but we actually ran for three months and then we shut down, and I had so many e-mails, I'd gotten to know so many customers so well that three or four months later we decided to reopen it and run it more like a business. But, it was initially, for us, just a way to test a menu. But we got caught up in the wave of the food truck revolution. All of a sudden, it spread like wildfire and the recession was hitting and this was a story that people, you know, caught their imaginations. Wall Street Journal had a list of top 10 food trucks in the country really early on and we were right up there. And it was a real moment, I think, for the industry and it was a lot of excitement for everybody. And when we opened the truck in Boston, that was the very first food truck in Boston for a long time. There used to be trucks back in the seventies and then they'd been shut down., Susan Kaplan: Well, you know, I often think of, I mean, ice cream trucks have been around seemingly for a very long time, but the food in a truck and the fact that you'd be moving around — except you really didn't move the truck around did you?, Ayr Muir: Yeah., Susan Kaplan: So, why the truck?, Ayr Muir: We drive to the site and we drive back from the site. It allows you to try different sites with flexibility in a different way than you can with a restaurant. So it's a great testing vehicle, and we loved it for that. Mayor Menino ate at our truck and that really, you know, he told us that sparked his idea to do the food truck program in Boston. We worked closely with the city in the early days of that, so you know, it feels great to be in that position and we've helped as many folks as we can get started. We used to run a food truck 101 seminar …, Susan Kaplan: Food truck 101 — out of the truck, no doubt?, Ayr Muir: We actually did that over in our commissary a couple of years in a row and it was packed. It would sell out and there were a couple hundred people. And I think, you know, we're in a little different era right now. I think the food trucks really were linked with that downturn in the economy. It was really hard for aspiring chefs to get the capital to open a restaurant and a food truck is a really low barrier to entry. I think on the other hand, there's a limit to how big you can run it. There's only so much food you can pack in a truck, and ..., Susan Kaplan: And only so many trucks you can flood the streets with., Ayr Muir: Absolutely, so we're at a place now where we love the trucks. It takes about as much effort to run a truck as it does at least one restaurant if not two. So there's a whole lot that goes into ... there's a lot of hassle and effort., Susan Kaplan: It is true, I think, that people are shifting a little bit in terms of what kind of food, how much takeout food they want or whether they want to sit in a restaurant. Did you find the demand for the food truck or what people were wanting to shift in any way and did that in any way sort of determine why you made this decision?, Ayr Muir: I don't have any information on a broader level if there's, you know, real changes in the sales or anything like that. For us, we've done well with our trucks through. We've de-emphasized them, obviously, as we've been growing the restaurants and having so much success with the restaurants, but we've actually been happy. The trucks are profitable for us, we just want to focus our attention to other places., Susan Kaplan: OK, thanks for joining us, Ayr., Ayr Muir: Thank you so much for having me., Susan Kaplan: That's Ayr Muir, founder of Clover Food Lab. Aside from special events, today was the last day that Clover's food trucks were out on the street.]"
686,"[In The Aftermath Of The Adam Jones Incident, Race Remains An Issue For Youth Baseball]","[Months after Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones said he was peppered with racial slurs by one or more Boston Red Sox fans at Fenway Park, local sports radio hosts and their listeners are still debating if the incident occurred at all. , Meanwhile, representatives of African-American community groups and Boston Red Sox officials have been meeting to address the state of race relations at Fenway. Among the requests made by members of the group purporting to represent black communities in the area are for more resources for kids of color. But the issues facing the Red Sox may be far more complex than what can be solved by free tickets and good will. , Six years ago, when I stood near the batters’ mound at Harambee Park in Dorchester for a story about race and baseball, the field was packed with kids. Recently, however, less than a dozen boys and girls stood in the outfield to catch fly balls., John Gordon has been coaching Dorchester-Roxbury Little League Baseball for 23 years. He says there’s no guarantee that kids will stay in the game, and even less of a guarantee that they will succeed in this and other Boston neighborhoods marked by disproportionately greater poverty, gangs and violence. But Gordon said the Red Sox could do more to promote baseball in communities of color., , “They know the interest is not in the African-American community,"" Gordon said. ""They know it. They know it’s not.”, When asked whether he'd say the Red Sox have given up, Gordon said, ""I would say so."" He says there was a time when the Red Sox relationship to this community was more robust, and more of his kids were treated with trips to Fenway.  , “Years ago, they used to reach out to us. They used to offer equipment and offer us to start leagues under the Red Sox Foundation, things of that sort,"" he said. ""But it hasn’t happened recently, cause every year we used to see 20 or 30 or 40 tickets they used to send down to get the kids interested to go to Fenway. We really haven’t seen too much anymore.”, Responding to Gordon, Boston Red Sox President Sam Kennedy said, “first of all there should be access to every kid in Boston and in New England that wants to go to Fenway Park.” , , Kennedy grew up in the South End and regularly attended games at Fenway as a kid, thanks to discounted tickets. Defending the Red Sox organization, Kennedy said the team has made Fenway Park more accessible over the years by charging less than the price of a movie.     , “For every game, for all 81 games, at our ticket office on the day of the game, we affirmatively hold back seats — $9 tickets for people to come to Fenway. We have to get that word out cause Fenway has to be accessible,"" Kennedy said. ""Those are the ways that we’re going to get kids to fall in love with baseball: access and participation.”, But at Harambee Park, the baseball field was almost bare compared to the adjacent basketball court and lacrosse field, which were packed with young people. , Willey Cunningham, wearing a baseball hat that showed the tatters of age, sighed thinking about the challenges of the game today. He is a 55-year-old assistant coach for Dorchester-Roxbury Little League who grew up playing baseball in Franklin Field near Blue Hill Avenue. Cunningham said what the Red Sox do, or don’t do, cannot necessarily reignite passion for baseball among distracted black youth.        , “I just think the culture today, I think what it is, is the game is slow. These kids don’t have the patience for this kind of game,"" he said ""You can’t appreciate someone who throws a no-hitter cause if you’re in the field, you’re bored.”, But Robert Lewis, executive director of the Dorchester youth sports and academic organization, THE BASE, said inner-city baseball can be great again, and he credits the Red Sox in part. , “We’re growing. We’ve been fortunate enough to raise resources, money and support with companies like Franklin, New Balance and others,"" said Lewis, whose recent experiences with baseball recruitment contrast greatly with John Gordon's. ""We’ve had more black and Latino kids not just go to games. Our kids are on the field. Over the years we’ve met Pedro, Big Papi and others. So, we’ve been provided all those opportunities to access that we wouldn’t have been able to get if the Red Sox not only didn’t give us tickets, but gave us access to being on the field.”, Lewis said the Red Sox shouldn’t be held responsible for cultural shifts. He advises Dorchester-Roxbury Little League to join with The BASE and other local groups to help revitalize baseball in communities of color, which is competing for attention with basketball, football, and now lacrosse., At Harambee field, coach John Gordon nodded his head in agreement. Gordon, who once worked for the Red Sox rookie team, is encouraging his 11 year-old son Ajani Jayden Gordon, who was warming up to pitch, to pursue a career in the sport. Ajani Jayden Gordon believes that Fenway and baseball are a lot friendlier to him today than they were to his father in the 1980s., “No bad things have been happening so far. I think baseball does accept me as a young man,"" Ajani Jayden Gordon said., , And Ajani says he feels comfortable at Fenway Park, which has not always been true for many people of color. Robert Lewis of THE BASE wants other people of color to be just as comfortable both attending Fenway and playing the game. , One thing is for sure: The greatest pastime in this country is baseball. And as John Gordon and his son Ajani Jayden Gordon prove, it is still the sport that gets passed down from a father to a son, no matter the color of their skin. , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"
687,[Discovering Underwater Art At Walden Pond],"[Kirk Etherton greets me by dropping a 25 pound boulder at my feet. He dove to the bottom of Walden Pond to excavate it. He tells me looking at the massive stone makes him think, “Did I really bring this up? It’s not like I was rescuing a stone baby. I mean, this took a long time. This took three attempts to bring to the surface.”, Etherton is a poet. But on hot summer days, the Somervillian takes up another art form: diving for rocks in Walden Pond. He excavates them, cleans them, and ties white cord around them. The cord is the length of how deep he dove for the rock. Technically, you're not supposed to remove rocks from state parks, but Etherton's never heard any complaints., , As he dives at Walden, Etherton launches his body away from the shore and swims out to the middle of the pond to free dive. A white plastic canister with 20 feet of string tied around it floats behind him, rippling over his wake. He’ll unravel the string from the canister as he swims to the bottom. The deepest he’s ever gone is 28 feet., “I’ll just take a deep breath. Dive down. Maybe I’ll see some fish,"" he explained before the plunge. ""I’ll find a rock and then, when I’m tired, I’ll just swim around and do some other stuff.”, Each rock is selected with care. Through goggles he looks for layered sediment and speckled fractures on a stone’s surface, a natural sculpture. He looks for the most interesting rock he can find. But sometimes, even with goggles, it can be hard to see., “Something might appear to be a good-sized rock, but  then, because of the distortion of the water ... you might have to move on and get something else,"" he said., There's the sound of a sinking splash. A few minutes pass. Suddenly, Etherton pops up to the surface, gasping for air. He is pleased with his choice., In the waters of Walden, Etherton feels truly comfortable. “I feel as though I am, essentially, largely a water creature. I feel more comfortable in the water than on land,” he said. , He says that the bottom of Walden is like the surface of the moon. Just a 30 minute drive away from home to escape the world. He’s even written a poem about it, called ""Dark Side of the Pond."", , Like any exploration, free diving comes with risks. “People who do this in a competitive way sometimes perish,” Etherton explained. He isn’t the only deep diver in Walden — some other divers have suggested he use tricks to dive deeper like flippers or even hyperventilation. He opts to do things, as Thoreau would have it, more simply. He reaches the bottom with just swim trunks and his lungs., Etherton’s rocks are elegant and unembellished. “I like to do things that involve real things. You can’t get much more simple than taking an interesting rock and wrapping it with a string equal to the length at which you found it,"" he said. ""One thing lead to another. I guess that’s how creation or creativity works for me.”, Etherton can't help but think about Thoreau while he dives for his rocks. “I always wonder what Thoreau would think of this ... Would he think it to be in the realm of living more simply? Or would he just think it was bizarre? I guess we’ll never know.”, ""Dark Side of the Pond"" , Prepare for a launch from the surface, rippling and reflecting., The countdown, inaudible, comes from the diaphragm: three ... two ... one: one last deep breath to last the length of this journey, beginning now with toes pointing, disappearing from the view of a horizontal lap-swimmer, appearing soon to the unblinking eyes of brown trout, ten feet down, passed by on this simple trip progressing into cool blue, blue-green, dark grey, darkness., The scene through goggles 15 feet below and still descending is a journey through deep space: reference points gone, velocity uncertain, countless luminous particles suspended passing as a film of distant stars bending time., Keep the trajectory with kicks and palm-thrusts — this soaring, climbing down now a feeling of leaving the earth, inverted ascent a working against buoyancy, not gravity., At 18 feet below, the destination — the stark, silent bottom of Walden Pond — looms into dim-lit view; at, 20 feet, the ice-water line of the thermocline offers its full-body embrace. The mission: find one fine rock to bring up from this lunar-like landscape, pulling it, from the slow-motion swirling silt, where it's been half-buried, glacier-dropped, waiting in time since before time was given a name., (Hours or years later this rock will become a sculpture, a precious stone, a talisman.), Now stand to survey this peaceful land. Now push off from 22 feet down to make the return trip, swimming toward widening light above with one free, non-stone-cradling hand., Now splash-up into the world of trains, trees, voices and air., Breath held must be released, but the rock retrieved can be held always, itself now held with a length of twine (equal to the depth where it was found), wrapped around it securely—reminder of another, other-worldly realm: that aquatic, imperturbable, almost-dark-side-of-the-moon., Tristan Cimini is a former producer for WGBH News’ K-12 Education Desk.

688,[Would You Spend 10 Cents More A Gallon To Buy Carbon-Neutral Gas?],"[Kyle Kornack says the juice company he ran with his friends was trying to be environmentally responsible. He wanted to look at their manufacturing process to understand the contribution they were making to climate change. “And see what the carbon footprint of each drink is,” Kornack said., They figured out how to cut some of those carbon emissions. And to balance out what they couldn’t eliminate, they looked into buying so-called carbon offsets. Those are payments to programs that are actively removing carbon from the atmosphere by doing things like planting trees. One day he got talking to the owner of a gas station in Jamaica Plain, and realized the owner controlled what price he charged for gas., “It got me thinking well what if we can apply a carbon offset and integrate that into gasoline?"" he said. ""Turns out it can be done for less than a dime.”, And that became the idea for a new start-up company. What if they gave people the chance — right at the gas pump — to pay ten more cents a gallon, and that money would go to carbon-reducing projects? Carbon offsets are usually bought by big companies that either are mandated to or want some good PR. But what if any of us could buy them and actually be carbon-neutral when we drive our cars?, “I thought it was immediately gold, and I literally wanted to stop making drinks,” said Liam Madden, one of Kornack’s business partners., It took their other partner, David Cooch, a little longer to come around, but he said he was fully on board when he realized what the idea could mean for the environment., “Nearly two thirds of [the] American population is concerned with climate change,"" Cooch said. ""But you don't really see, you know, this two thirds of people changing their lifestyle significantly or beginning to actually take action on climate change. And I think part of the reason is that there is a lack of access to sort of the simplicity and the affordability of being involved in the carbon market and be involved in helping live sustainably and fund climate solutions.”, , They put the juice company aside. and focused on starting what they now call the Green Gas Movement. Their vision was a simple one. , The idea is that when drivers show up to a pump, they see a button that says, ""Would you like to drive green today?"" — just like the button that asks whether you want to add a car wash or use credit to pay for the purchase.  ""Or they could have a green gas debit card in their wallet,” says Madden., And by doing that, they could make a small investment in programs like Taking Root, which pays farmers in Nicaragua to reforest clear-cut areas. The farmers plant trees that grow coffee and other products that provide them with an income. Alvin Castellon is in Nicaragua, and works with about 600 families in the program who have reforested around 5,000 acres., “There’s been a big impact environmentally,"" Castellon said through a translator. ""But the impact has also been social, such as employing the local community."", But are drivers here in the U.S. willing to spend an extra 10 cents a gallon to have that impact? The Green Gas guys point to a study that offered to sell Uber ride-sharing customers a carbon offset after their trip. Depending on the amount, between 50 and 75 percent of them said they’d keep doing it. And the idea’s popular at one Brighton gas station., “Sure. If this helps the ecosystem, will be great,"" said Nelson Villareyna, who's from Nicaragua, but now lives on Boston. “I could see that being something that would alleviate the guilt that I feel as somebody who cares about the environment but also has to drive my car a lot,” said Grace Coburn of Brighton. “As long as we're not talking about gas going back to $5 a gallon, if it keeps within the same price range that we are seeing, [it] is fine,” said Jeff Lopes of Quincy., But some are skeptical. “I don't trust [it],"" said Daniel Sanieoff of Brookline. ""I don't know where is the money going to go. Everybody pockets everything. So I don't trust anybody.”, It’s a reasonable concern. About a decade ago, there were some carbon offset programs that didn’t really have the impact they said they did. But there’s now a system in place to independently verify that the work’s really being done., You can’t easily buy carbon offsets at the pump yet. But the Green Gas Movement is getting closer. They won an MIT contest for environmental start-up ideas, and recently launched a crowd-funding campaign., They’re hoping the first step in their movement — a credit card for gas purchases — will be ready to launch in the fall. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
689,[LISTEN: Explaining Michelle Carter's Sentence],"[Susan Kaplan: This is All Things Considered. I'm Susan Kaplan. Michelle Carter, the Plainville woman convicted of involuntary manslaughter for her role in the suicide of Conrad Roy III, has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison — half of that sentence suspended. Carter had opted for a bench trial, and two months ago was found guilty by the presiding judge. Now that same judge has handed down the sentence, though Carter is free for now as she appeals her case. Joining us on the line to explain Carter's sentence is WGBH News legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed. Thanks for joining us Daniel., Daniel Medwed: My pleasure, Susan., Susan Kaplan: So Carter's case is sort of one of a kind. She was convicted of manslaughter based on a series of text messages and phone calls between her and Roy in which she encouraged him to follow through on a plan to commit suicide. Both Carter and Roy were teenagers at the time. Does the sentence fit the crime?, Daniel Medwed: People are going to debate this for the next few days, maybe the next few decades, actually. I think it's appropriate that she did receive prison time, and I'm not sure if this is sufficient. Some people will be upset. But given that she was a juvenile — 17 at the time of the crime — had a lengthy and well-documented history of mental health troubles, and was under medication at the time of the incident, it makes sense that Judge Moniz would extend some measure of leniency. As he said in his remarks, the purpose of the juvenile system, in many respects, is to offer rehabilitative opportunities. And I think that is probably what was behind this decision., Susan Kaplan: Why is it that the judge sentenced Carter to two-and-a-half years, but said that she only needs to spend 15 months of that sentence actually behind bars?, Daniel Medwed: I think the idea behind that is by suspending the second half of the sentence - the remaining 15 months - he's providing an incentive for her to live on the up and up and accommodate and abide by all the terms of her probation. So part of it is an incentive system., Susan Kaplan: Can you explain what the judge was weighing legally when he decided upon the sentence?, Daniel Medwed: There are a lot of different factors. You look at the crime itself, the blame-worthiness of the defendant, the defendant's future prospects, the concern about deterrence, what message the sentence would send. The rehabilitation angle in some respects is a complicated stew where you put in aggravating ingredients and mitigating ingredients and come up with a dish. And I think in the end he did rely on some of the fundamental principles of the juvenile justice system. She was a teenager at the time. We know a lot about adolescent brain development now, that people don't fully develop their capacity for decision making up until the age until the age of 25. And I think when he mixed up this and added in all these elements he came up with two-and-a-half years — half of it suspended., Susan Kaplan: OK, so the case was tried in juvenile court. Is it common though to see sentences like this come out of manslaughter convictions in the juvenile system?, Daniel Medwed: It's uncommon in many respects. This case is very idiosyncratic. She was charged as a youthful offender, which is a designation that was created about 20 years ago by the legislature to basically be tough on juveniles who commit serious crimes. And youthful offenders, even though they committed the crimes while juveniles technically face adult sentencing exposure. So in this instance, as a youthful offender, she was facing anywhere from probation to 20 years. And she could spend it in a juvenile facility until the age of 21 or in an adult facility. She could also spend it in a county jail or in the state prison. Here, Judge Moniz opted for the county jail, which has a lot of benefits for Michelle Carter. It is closer to her family. It's going to be in Bristol County and county jails are often not as bureaucratic, not as potentially fraught with peril depending on the situation as state facilities., Susan Kaplan: What sort of precedent does this set?, Daniel Medwed: The case itself — such a tremendous legal precedent ... because it was a manslaughter case in essentially what is a coerced suicide situation. It also creates precedent not just because it was manslaughter basically for words that prompted someone else to act, but also for what it says about criminal causation. She wasn't there with Conrad Roy. She was in a remote place communicating with him through text messages and through the telephone. And ultimately he made the decision alone in the car to kill himself. And a lot of scholars, and I'm in this camp, would say that his behavior was an intervening cause that broke the chain of causation from her action and the final result., So it's quite possible that this conviction is vulnerable on appeal. If it survives, it will certainly be a significant precedent. And no matter what, it’s something that I'm going to put in a casebook one day., Susan Kaplan: OK, thanks for joining us Daniel., Daniel Medwed: My pleasure, Susan., Susan Kaplan: That's WGBH legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed talking to us about the case of Michelle Carter, the woman convicted of involuntary manslaughter for encouraging her friend Conrad Roy III to commit suicide. Carter was handed a two-and-a-half year sentence today — half of that sentence is suspended, and Carter is free for now pending appeal.,  ]"

He says cyanobacteria is always present, but it spikes when there's runoff laced with stuff they like to eat, such as phosporus and nitrogen., ""Those nutrients provide almost like a Petri dish for the bacteria to grow in the waterbody,” says Nascarella., Yesterday’s storms could be both a help and a hindrance when it comes to the cyanobacteria bloom in the Charles., That’s because the bloom in the lower basin might get flushed out into Boston Harbor with all the rain, says Elizabeth Cianciola, an aquatic scientist with the Charles River Watershed Association., On the other hand, Cianciola says, such storms also increase runoff upstream, eventually returning more bacteria-producing nutrients into the river. , She says one key to a healthy Charles is to cut down on nutrient pollution from the runoff., ""Not only does reducing the stormwater runoff remove the nutrient pollution that fuels the growth of the cyanobacteria blooms,” Cianciola says,  “but it also recharges the flow in the Charles River.

693,[ Michelle Carter To Be Sentenced In Manslaughter Case],"[Michelle Carter is scheduled to be sentenced today after she was convicted of manslaughter for encouraging a high school friend to kill himself through texts and phone calls., The prosecution will likely ask for a long sentence — as much as 20 years in prison; the defense will ask for leniency., That's according to WGBH Legal Analyst and Northeastern professor Daniel Medwed., He says the defense will probably point out that Carter was 17 when she committed her crime, and that she has mental health issues., Medwed says one motivation for a long sentence is to send a message that the courts will not tolerate such behavior. On the other hand, Medwed says, ""the defense perspective on that is that deterrence uses people to make a broader point, that Michelle Carter's life is at stake, and she shouldn't be used to make an example of."", Medwed also says that if Carter's guilty verdict survives any appeals, it could bear on similar cases., ""Because what makes this case unusual,” says Medwed, “is this idea that you can predicate manslaughter, basically on text messages — that her words were the weapon."", A judge found Carter guilty in June for her role in the death of her friend, Conrad Roy III.

His name is Darrell Jones., Jennifer McKim: Correct. So Darrell 'Diamond' Jones was 18 years old when he was arrested for the murder of an alleged Cuban drug dealer named Guillermo Rodriguez in a parking lot in Brockton. He has always said that he did not commit the crime and has tried to appeal it multiple times. This last appeal seems to be having some traction., Susan Kaplan: As I understand it, he's been trying to get his case reopened. He filed a motion in 2015 and then in 2016. One of the jurors came forward with claims of bias during deliberations?, Jennifer McKim: Correct. So, actually we became aware that Darrell Jones was filing this appeal and we started investigating his case. And in fact, we went out and interviewed this juror as part of the investigation., Susan Kaplan: Why did you decide to do this?, Jennifer McKim: It's interesting — Darrell Jones’ wife Joanna [sic] reached out to me [and] told me that Darrell was interested in talking to us about jail conditions and invited me to visit him in prison. So, I went out to visit him in prison and started talking about his case and I found it really fascinating and decided that's what I wanted to focus the investigation on., Susan Kaplan: And that led you to speaking to a juror?, Jennifer McKim: When we reached her, it was like she'd remembered it [like] it was yesterday. It is like she was waiting for the phone call. She had been the last holdout juror in this case and she regretted ever since that she convicted him and didn't expect at the time that he would go away for life. Her allegation is that she walked into court on the first day of jury deliberations and two men said that they thought he was guilty because he was black. Because Darrell Jones was black, and it was an all white jury., Susan Kaplan: So jury deliberations are supposed to be secret. But a Supreme Court decision has opened the door to in very specific circumstances. As I understand it — to go back and revisit the deliberations. Tell us about that Supreme Court decision and how that's affected what has happened since, including as you were in court yesterday., Jennifer McKim: Right, so in March the Supreme Court made a decision on a Colorado man who had been found guilty of sexual assault and found out a juror had said that he had done that because he was Mexican. And that's what Mexicans do. Something like that. And he [the Colorado man] appealed this all the way up to the Supreme Court where the Supreme Court decided that if there are those types of allegations of racial bias in a case then a trial judge is required to look into it. So that came months before Darrell's case started to be heard and the judge decided that he needed to look into these allegations., Susan Kaplan: In this case, where does the factor of memory and the recollection — even if it's a poignant moment from the jury deliberations. How does that factor into how the judge looks at this?, Jennifer McKim: It's so interesting because [the] Darrell Jones case is totally based on eyewitness testimony from the beginning. So then to have this other strange ripple of trying to remember what happened in the case 32 years ago. And basically you see, these three jurors came in yesterday and one of them was limping — she could hardly walk — she could hardly remember anything and she just … I felt for her, he just looked at the judge and said ‘I'm racking my brain — I can't remember anything that happened in this trial at all.’ It was a struggle and yet this other juror who we spoke to and that prompted the hearing remembers it clearly., Susan Kaplan: What did the juror who you're talking about who remembers it so vividly, what did she say yesterday?, Jennifer McKim: This was another strange twist. The judge had summoned eight jurors from my understanding to come to court and only three showed up, and the one who we spoke to was not there. I called her after the hearing yesterday and said, 'What happened?' and she claims she never even got the summons and she would have been there. So my understanding is the judge is thinking of having another hearing and trying to bring other people in perhaps do a better job at trying to track everybody down., Susan Kaplan: So what happens if in fact the judge decides that this was the case. It's still kind of what we think of maybe as a kind of a hearsay moment from people recalling something that happened 30 years ago. What are the parameters of legally of what they can do with that information, should the judge decide that in fact this occurred? Can they reopen the case - what happens?, Jennifer McKim: So my understanding is that the Supreme Court decision doesn't make that very clear. So there are a lot of questions that happen after. If he [the judge] does determine there was racism in the jury deliberations, what happens next is unclear. The judge also though is taking this into consideration as part of a larger appeal that Darrell Jones has made about his allegations of unfairness in the trial. He claims that he was set up by police. He claims that there was a corrupted videotape that kept out important parts of the case. So, there's a lot of things that he's alleging and the judge I think is going to be taking all of this into consideration when considering his motion to reopen., Susan Kaplan: OK thanks for joining us Jennifer., Jennifer McKim: Thank you., Susan Kaplan: That's Jennifer McKim of WGBH news partner the New England Center for Investigative Reporting.

695,[The Commonwealth Avenue Bridge Project: What You Need to Know],"[Even officials from the Department of Transportation described the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge Project as ""hell on wheels."" So far it's been a headache mostly for people along the Mass. Pike, but officials from MassDOT say things are going smoothly., Overview: The construction project, which began on July 26, is replacing the eastbound lane on the Commonwealth Avenue bridge along with multiple steel girders supporting the bridge. The project follows an ""accelerated"" construction timeline of two-and-a-half weeks. Major portions of the bridge were built offsite and are being installed by crews of 200 workers active 24 hours a day. MassDot estimates the project will complete by Aug. 14, with delays to the Mass. Pike ending on Aug. 7. Construction is impacting multiple areas and modes of transportation from the Mass. Pike, the commuter rail, bus routes and the Green Line B Branch. Below is a break down of the impacts for each category, followed by a day-to-day breakdown on how the project is progressing. If there's one general consensus: Avoid the Mass. Pike., Mass. Pike: On July 28 at 9 p.m., reduced access along the Mass. Pike between the Allston Interchange and the Beacon Street overpass began. On weekdays between 5 a.m. and 7 p.m., two lanes are open for the east and westbound lanes. This has been the biggest issue, causing backups to Watertown and Newton starting at around 6:30 a.m. each day. The week of Aug. 2 to Aug. 7 from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., there will be only one westbound lane. On the weekends and ""off-peak"" hours both east and westbound are reduced to one lane., The exit to Cambridge Street and Soldier's Field Road on the eastbound lane is closed. Exit 20 on the westbound lane is closed intermittently. The lane closures are supposed to end on Aug. 7., Commonwealth Avenue: Both the Commonwealth Avenue and Boston University Bridge are closed until Aug. 14. The westbound lane on the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge is open to local abutters, businesses, emergency vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. Suggested detours go to Harvard Avenue then Cambridge Street and onto Memorial Drive., Green Line B Branch: The Green Line B Branch is closed between Babcock and Blandford Streets until Aug. 13. The MBTA is running Peter Pan coach buses as a shuttle service located at the usual stops. Some commuters have told WGBH News reporters that the trips take about 10 minutes longer than normal trolley service. The Green Line is shuttered because crews removed the track running across Commonwealth Avenue and must wait until construction on the bridge is complete before laying down a replacement., Buses/Commuter Rail: The 47 and CT2 buses are operating on detoured routes, so expect some delays. The 57 is operating normally. , The Worcester/Framingham commuter rail line operates normally during weekdays. Service stops this weekend at Boston Landing with a shuttle available on the D line to Reservoir station. There is no scheduled shuttle between Boston Landing to Back Bay, Yawkey Way and South Station except for days when the Red Sox play. On game nights a shuttle will run from Boston Landing to Yawkey Way three hours before the game., The weekend of Aug. 5-7, Amtrak's Lakeshore Limited is replaced by shuttle buses to Albany, N.Y., What we've encountered: WGBH News deployed reporters to Commonwealth Avenue following the closure of the Green Line B Branch the night of July 26. Most commuters said they experienced a five to 10 minute delay riding the Peter Pan buses that are replacing services between Babcock and Blandford Streets. The MBTA contracted service to Peter Ban because the demand would be too great on their bus fleet, according to the Assistant General Manager of Rail Operations, Bill McClellan. Reporter Gabrielle Emmanuel spoke with Lyft drivers and local business owners who are concerned about the impact the disruption will have. Drivers for ride-sharing services reported frustration over the increased traffic, which for them translates to more gas and fewer customers., While both the BU and Commonwealth Avenue bridges closed down on July 27 disrupting local traffic, most commuters were holding their breath for the disruptions on the Mass. Pike that began Monday, July 31. Most commuters seemed to heed warnings from John Gulliver, the interim high administrator for MassDOT, and avoided the Mass. Pike. WGBH News' Aaron Schachter found the Pike to be relatively empty between 5 and 6 a.m., but just 45 minutes later, traffic began to build. However, the first day of disruptions weren't as bad as projected., MassDOT has estimated an extra 90 minutes to travel times. That assessment became true on Aug. 1 and Aug. 2, when traffic was backed up almost three miles to the Newtown and Watertown exits starting around 6 a.m. While local roads around Commonwealth Avenue are experiencing more congestion, the Mass. Pike should be avoided unless it's absolutely necessary.]"
696,[Boston Comic Con Visits Patients At Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital],"[Behind the superhero costume of a cosplayer is a person wanting to make someone smile., Cosplayers from Boston Comic Con, dressed in Marvel and DC superhero costumes, visited the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Charlestown on Tuesday to meet patients and present the comic convention’s three-day premium pass to 15-year-old Matt Limoli of Billerica. Limoli missed Comic Con last year during his recovery at Spaulding. This was the second “Spaulding Gets Super” day at the hospital, which originated from Limoli’s stay at Spaulding., Limoli, then 14, was hit by a car while crossing the street with his bike on July 21, 2016. He says he doesn’t remember much of the accident. Limoli spent eight days at Boston Children’s Hospital and then the next 20 days at Spaulding. He was in a wheelchair from August to October and has since almost fully recovered aside from his femur, which still bothers him today., Kim Limoli, Matt's mother, says his great-aunt, Ruby Von Dwornick, could see how upset he was for missing that year’s Boston Comic Con. So, Von Dwornick decided to make some calls and bring Comic Con to the hospital. Von Dwornick was not present at this year’s superhero day., Clinicians wore matching Wonder Woman T-shirts. Cosplayers dressed as Batman, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, Captain America, Spiderman and Black Widow traveled up the elevators to the adult floors where they bantered and teased each other to entertain the patients., “Having them come here, especially when we can’t go out to conventions is personally awesome,” said Amanda Oliver, 25, who has been a patient the hospital for the past month and a half., , There was even a new superhero by the name of Wheelchair Man, who can make criminals see the consequences of their crime before it is committed. The character was invented by Mohammad Sayed, the author and cosplayer behind the comic series that is based on his life as an Afghan refugee in a wheelchair., , The last stop was the pediatric unit, where children dressed as superheroes, ate cake and pizza, and drew pictures of the comic book characters. One young, soft-spoken, patient dressed as Clark Kent unbuttoned his white button-down shirt to reveal his Superman costume to the rest of the superheroes., , Alize Cordell is the co-founder of CausePlay New England, a volunteer organization that unites cosplayers with different communities around New England to make a difference. She dressed as Wonder Woman for ""Spaulding Gets Super"" and presented the three-day premium pass and last year’s Boston Comic Con T-shirt to Limoli., “He was supposed to go to Boston Comic Con [last year] and he couldn’t. So it was really awesome for us to come and give him his own Comic Con,” said Cordell. “It was really nice for me, too because I did get to go to Boston Comic Con. And it really puts things in perspective for you because I get to go to this thing, and this 15-year-old boy doesn’t because of this tragic accident.”, , This year's Boston Comic Con beings Aug. 11 and ends Aug. 13. During the convention, Limoli will dress up as Matt Smith, the 11th doctor of Doctor Who., “Things like this really help people come out. It raises their energy levels,” said Tim Sullivan, the director of communications and media relations at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. “A lot of times what we find with events we do at the hospital, when patients are back in therapy, they have a little bit more bounce in their step, a little bit of pep and energy that helps them try and get better, which is what we are all about.”, Limoli says seeing the children happy to see the cosplayers made him happy. Maybe one day, when he’s older, he might dress up in a superhero costume for patients at hospitals, too., This post has been updated to reflect Alize Cordell's involvement with ""Spaulding Gets Super.""]"

699,"[Millennium Tower – Shadow Included – A Deal Done? Not So Fast, Says Secretary Of State Galvin]","[Secretary of Commonwealth Bill Galvin is girding up for some shadow boxing. , When Governor Charlie Baker put his pen on Friday to a bill exempting a proposed skyscraper from state laws regulating the shadow it can cast on Boston Common, it seemed to many that the controversial Millennium Tower project was a done deal., Not so, Secretary of Commonwealth Bill Galvin told WGBH News on Monday., In fact, Galvin — by no means the only critic of this special exemption for a particular project, but likely now the most influential — appears ready for a protracted fight over a project that has already been a source of controversy for the better part of a year., “All this legislation did was remove a layer of protection that was there, which is unfortunate,” Galvin said in an interview. But, he said: “It doesn’t necessarily mean the building is going to be built. There’s still a process to go through, and we’re certainly going to be part of that process.”, By “we” Galvin meant the State Historical Commission, of which Galvin, in his capacity as secretary of state, is chair., And the process in question is a state environmental impact review, which will include reviewing the impact of the proposed development not just on the Common but on historical buildings in the area., Galvin was highly critical of the process thus far, noting that the City of Boston never conducted an independent review of the building and its impact; that the developers had revealed the expected shadow only after having skirted city review; and that the developers acknowledged to state officials, after Boston City Council had passed the home rule petition for exemption, that they still weren’t sure how tall the building would be., But he expects a much more thorough state impact review, he said., “Obviously I hope it’s done appropriately, and that it’s not short-circuited, as the review the city might have done was,” Galvin said. “And we’ll certainly be a part of that.”   , The tower, which would be built on the city-owned parcel known as Winthrop Square, would cast a shadow on Boston Commo. That meant that the project needed an exemption from laws meant to protect open spaces and historic buildings from being overshadowed by tall buildings., With Baker’s signature, developer Millennium Partners got that exemption, after having run a political gauntlet through Boston City Council, public outcry, frowning editorials and an uncertain outcome in the state legislature., That outcome was all the more uncertain thanks to the intervention of Galvin, who appeared before state lawmakers asking them in no uncertain terms to shut the process down, after learning that the developers were still tweaking their plans and that they couldn’t say themselves exactly how big this shadow would be., And then there was the bargaining: The bill sat for weeks, as stakeholders like the Friends of the Public Garden negotiated with Millennium Partners over whether and how much the developers would pony up in economic (if not solar) mitigation. The shadow of Boston Mayor Marty Walsh – a firm proponent of the development – loomed over the whole affair., Last week, Friends of the Public Garden announced that Millennium Partners had agreed to contribute $125,000 annually for forty years, in addition to a lump sum payment of about $28 million., In a written statement, Friends Board Chairperson Leslie Adams acknowledged that the group had “lost the battle to prevent this exemption from state laws.” But, Adams said the funds Millennium has committed would help maintain the Common in the future and that this would be a “one-time” — the words were printed in bold — exception to the shadow laws., Secretary Galvin was milder in his assessment of such side deals, telling WGBH News that he didn’t blame groups like the Friends of the Public Garden for getting the best deal they could once the city council had approved the home rule petition for exemption., “I personally think it was unwise,” he said, calling Millennium’s offer “paltry.”, But, he said, “We have to move on now. They [the legislature] have made their decision., “There is a process,"" Galvin added. ""We’re going to go through the process, and wherever it leads, we’ll see.”, Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

710,[Angry Birds Are Impacting New England's Fishing Rules],"[Six miles off New Hampshire’s short stretch of coastline, the Isles of Shoals attract day trippers, but there’s not much reason to stay. The islands — there are nine of them — have no restaurants, public hotels or seasonal rentals., Yet Liz Craig has found a way to spend the summer here on White’s Island. It’s little more than a hill of rocks with a majestic old lighthouse perched on top.  She’s taken up residence in the lighthouse keeper’s cottage. The ocean views are exquisite, but the cottage has seen better days. The paint is peeling, there’s no running water and Craig needs to haul in propane for the stove., “If you think of it as camping, it’s really posh,"" said Craig., The whole place is for the birds — a threatened species of seabirds called terns. Craig, a University of New Hampshire biologist, is conducting research to help both the terns and another at-risk group, fishermen., “Terns are excellent bio indicators of what’s going on in the environment,” said Craig. “They tell us a ton about what’s going on about the health of the Gulf of Maine and resource availability.”, To get to the birds, Craig waits until low tide and crosses a rocky path that leads to neighboring Seavey Island where there are thousands of terns. Smaller than seagulls, they’re white and gray with black heads and bright orange beaks. They circle close to human visitors and it’s hard not to think of Alfred Hitchcock’s famous movie, ""The Birds."" Craig, her research assistant and a WGBH News crew are wearing straw hats with wide brims — protection from the birds' aggression., “When the birds are truly aggressive you’ll see me out here — not just with this hat — but I’ll put some padding in the base of it because they’ll dive bomb and hit you as hard as they can,” Craig said, “as well as throwing poop at you because they’ll do everything they can to try to scare you off because they perceive you — us — as a predator.”, Their message: don’t mess with mama bird. Or papa. They’ve come to breed. The island is the only tern colony in New Hampshire and one of a dwindling number worldwide. Tiny nests are everywhere — in rock crevices and in the tall grass where Craig has retrieved a chick., “It has a wing of 179 millimeters,” she says as she juggles both the tern chick and a ruler. She’s been charting the chicks’ size and weight throughout the summer, much the way a pediatrician tracks an infant’s growth.,  ""We can actually compare the weight and condition of the bird with the types of and amount of food the adults are bringing back to them,” said Craig. “They get their checkup.”, The checkups show many of the chicks are underweight, indicating they’re not getting enough of the food terns favor: herring and other bait fish. It’s a significant finding not only about the health of the birds, but also the ocean. If the terns are in trouble, local lobstermen who rely on the same fish could be, too. Data collected from this colony is factored into local fisheries management.  , “These terns are becoming an important player in these models which will help us sustain fisheries in New England,” explained Jennifer Seavey, executive director of the Shoals Marine Laboratory, which administers the Tern Conservation Program., It’s one reason scientists want to see colonies like this one thrive. They also feel a duty to protect a bird that's long been in an an uphill fight for survival.  Terns were harvested in the 19th century for ladies’ hats. More recently, development has encroached on areas where they once nested. There’s also an age-old predator: seagulls. They poach eggs and even adult terns., Just by being on the island, Craig and her research team deter the gulls and safeguard a new generation of terns. , “The chicks are starting to fly and for me it’s the most amazing moment, because you get to see all the hard work you’ve put in and they’ve put in,” said Craig. “It’s a really exciting time of the season.”, Before summer’s end the terns will take off for destinations as far as Argentina. The research gathered on this island will be shared with other scientists studying terns — and ocean health — around the world., Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"
711,[State Reviewing Controversial Weymouth Natural Gas Compressor Plan],"[A group of protesters gathered earlier this month on the steps of the Massachusetts State House, singing, ""What do we do with methane gas? Keep it in the ground!"", , Keeping methane gas in the ground is a priority for them. And they certainly don’t want to see that gas go through a compressor station in or near their community. , “The proposed Weymouth's compressor station is truly a threat to my children's safety, security, and health,” said protester Jennifer Mathien of Hingham., The Weymouth compressor would be built on a four-acre lot in an industrial area just over the massive Fore River Bridge from Quincy. , At the site, Weymouth town councilor Becky Haugh pointed to an empty lot on the other side of a metal fence. “So right now we're pretty much just looking at open space right now with some trees and grass.”, The station would compress natural gas to keep it moving through transmission pipelines that snake out across the Northeast. Haugh said she doesn’t think this is an appropriate spot for that compression., , “Most compressor stations are sited in very rural communities,"" she said. ""So if an explosion or any malfunction were to happen there's nothing that it would affect. Whereas here as you can see, you're standing right here. Should a fire occur or anything you have the bridge right there you have the sewer pumping station, you have the factory, you have the gas power plant. So we don't know what the consequences would be.”  , And even though it’s an industrial area, Haugh pointed to a building on the other side of some trees. “So literally that's the first house right there,"" she said. And she’s worried emissions from the plant can cause everything from nosebleeds to cancer., The company that wants to build the compressor, Enbridge, says residents have nothing to worry about. , “Compressor stations are highly regulated facilities and compressor stations must meet rigorous siting standards established by FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,” said spokesperson Mary Lee Hanley., Hanley said compressor stations must be strategically placed at intervals along the lines, and this Weymouth location is perfect. “It will not result in any impacts to forested lands, wetlands, water bodies, or public roads,"" she said.    , Tom Kiley, the president and CEO of the Northeast Gas Association, a trade group for the industry, said there are 1,400 of these stations across the country., “There are some very rural areas in the middle of woods in some states,"" Kiley said. ""But in other areas, the compressor stations are located in population centers.” Kiley said that’s not a problem, because compressor stations are safe., There are two other compressor stations in the state. Last month, Enbridge dropped its proposal to build another one in Rehoboth, after residents there voted against the plan in a town referendum. Kiley said opposition to compressor sites is the usual not-in-my-backyard pressure that any energy facility faces when it’s proposed., “At the end of the day, we need these facilities sited if we're going to continue to deliver product uninterrupted reliably and safely,” he said., The initial application for the facility said there would be some scary-sounding emissions. But when the feds approved the plan in January, they said all those emissions were well below federal limits. That’s not reassuring to Dr. Curt Nordgaard, a Boston pediatrician who’s become an activist against the compressor., , “Even down to very low levels, air pollution is harmful for human health, and that's even below what's considered to be a safe standard today,” Nordgaard said., Nordgaard and other opponents of the compressor plan hired an outside company to test the current air quality at and around the proposed site., “The company tested for about 60 different chemicals and we found violations or exceedances of 10 of those.”, And he said the state should be doing something about what’s there already -- not adding more of those pollutants with a new station., Governor Charlie Baker initially didn’t take a position on the compressor debate. The protesters outside his office earlier this month wanted the governor to direct state agencies to deny permits for the Weymouth compressor.  Baker didn’t go that far, but after that protest, he did order his Departments of Public Health and Environmental Protection to conduct a review, before issuing any state permits. Those reviews are happening now. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

""We all know that if you've got an issue, the first point of moving forward is acknowledging your issue. He hasn’t acknowledged his issue.”, , Attorney Mitchell Garabedian, who represents victims and their families, argues that even at age 86, Shanley is still a danger to the community., “It’s not a maybe, he’s going to be doing it,"" Garabedian said. ""He's molested hundreds of children. There’s no doubt in our minds.”, Shanley is expected to be released as a level-three sex offender, the category considered to be most likely to re-offend, requiring him to be on a public registry. But Garabedian says Shanley can apply to have that level reduced. , “There is nothing preventing Paul Shanley from doing that. Nothing. Now, if we have two experts who found him not to be a sexually dangerous person, I think he can go out and find some expert who's going to say he shouldn't be a level-two, he should be, by the way, a level-one, so that his whereabouts will not be public.”, Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said they can’t civilly commit Shanley without expert testimony that he meets the requirement as a sexually dangerous person. But the DA hired two doctors described as qualified examiners, who both concluded that Shanley doesn’t meet that criteria. The doctors haven’t yet formally filed their report with the DA’s office, so their reasoning is unknown. But Attorney Carmen Durso, who also represents victims, said he thinks age was a factor, and he criticized that consideration., “The standards they are applying, they’ve got to be changed,"" Durso said. ""If a Paul Shanley can walk out of prison after his conviction because these standards don't apply to him, then I don't know who’s going to be stopped from walking out the door.”, , Rodney Ford’s son Greg was one of Shanley’s victims. “Every parent has to be vigilant with their kids if they see Paul Shanley in their neighborhood,” Ford said., During the press conference in Durso’s office, Ford said there’s nothing more that can be done but to harass Shanley. He was asked what he’d do if they ran into each other., “If I ran into Shanley, as a father, what he did to me, my son …"" Durso trailed off, and Attorney Carmen Durso stepped in and spoke quietly to him. “But you would not hurt him,” Durso said to him., “I would hurt him,” Ford replied., Ford later clarified that he has no plans to go after Shanley, saying it would mean his kids wouldn’t have a father anymore., “It wouldn’t be worth it,"" he said. ""I have those thoughts. What father wouldn't have those thoughts — that destroyed his son. I have to be real and tell you that. But I’m not going to physically go after Paul Shanley.”, The DA’s office says Shanley will be monitored on probation for 10 years and is prohibited from contacting children under 16 years old. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

720,[New Study Shows Prevalence Of CTE In Football Players ],"[Barbara Howard: A stunning statistic out today regarding a brain disease that's closely associated with football players: Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. CTE can only be diagnosed after death. The brains of 111 NFL players were studied and CTE was found in all of them except one. That is a rate of over 99 percent. The study was conducted by Boston University School of Medicine and the VA Boston health care system, and it's out today in the journal of the American Medical Association. One of the authors is Dr. Daniel Daneshvar from BU's CTE center. Thanks for talking with us, Dr. Daneshvar., Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: Thank you for having me, Barbara., Barbara Howard: So 111 NFL player brains and all but one was CTE. Was that a surprise to you?, Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: Yes. We've been studying this disease for about eight or nine years at the Boston University center and we'd been finding a high proportion of CTE in individuals who play a lot of contact sports, be that NFL or hockey or other sports. What we were particularly shocked to find, though, was that so many of them had CTE over a relatively short time period, the eight years of the study window., Barbara Howard: So to a layman's eye, when you're looking at a brain sample, how is a CTE brain different from a healthy brain? , Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: One of the reasons why the disease has gone under the radar is that a normal brain and a brain with earlier or moderate stage CTE — to the naked eye — is really relatively undistinguishable. It's only when you stain for a specific abnormal protein called tau that you can detect the evidence of CTE. This tau protein is in a number of neuro-degenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, but when it's in a specific pattern, that's diagnostic for CTE., Barbara Howard: Well, it does present itself sometimes as diseases associated with aging, for example, Alzheimer's disease. Also, there's a high rate of suicide that's associated with CTE, and some of the brains that your research team had access to came from NFL players who had committed suicide, and some committed suicide in ways that seemed meant to preserve their brains. Former New England Patriot Junior Seau comes to mind — he shot himself in the chest. It seems like some of these players suffering from CTE know that something is wrong with them, but they can't figure it out. What's your thinking on that?, Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: I think you're exactly right. A number of these individuals, be it at the NFL level or folks who only played through college or even high school, when they start to get advanced in age, they begin to develop problems with memory, problems with concentration, at an earlier age than they otherwise might have, and as a result, they can kind of tell something's wrong. That can be incredibly disconcerting for these individuals and unfortunately, some of them did end up taking their own life. The important thing about this study, though, is that we're hoping to bring this cohort together and from them, in this comprehensive and methodologically rigorous way, begin to answer questions for living athletes. , Barbara Howard: Like, should I play football? That would be a question obviously raised — what do you think?, , Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: At this point, we can't really make statements regarding what types of hits to the head are responsible for CTE or whether or not there's a relationship with how early you start playing football, or any genetic factors or other factors that might influence those decisions about whether or not an individual should play football. We're hoping that using this cohort, and by literally doubling the number of CTE cases in the world's literature through this cohort, we're hoping to be able to answer those questions. , Barbara Howard: And by this cohort, you're talking about this particular study. Now, you're talking about 110 of 111 NFL players found who have CTE. In other parts of your study, 48 of the 53 brains studied of college players — that's 91 percent — were found to also have CTE. And in high school players, the rate drops down to 21 percent — three of 14. Is that only because you can't get a large enough sample?, Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: We necessarily have a skewed sample simply because the individuals who choose to donate their brains to our center, either they or their loved ones are more likely to think that there's something wrong, and that's why they chose to donate. That being said, there were individuals who did not have any symptoms that chose to donate to our study over the years. We know that individuals in this study are more likely to think that they have a problem and that makes the sample biased in that way., Barbara Howard: It does seem like that would skew the result if you have the families of players with these symptoms already in life donating brains — it's sort of already predetermined, isn't it?, Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: You're exactly right, in that the individuals who choose to donate, they're more likely to have had problems. But that being said, we didn't screen athletes based on whether or not they had problems in life. The only inclusion criteria for this study were based on whether or not someone played football. It certainly is more likely to be biased for those reasons you just mentioned, but what we can say is that we found 110 NFL players with CTE over just an eight-year time course. That indicates that this is a significant problem., Barbara Howard: And 91 percent among college players, but why 21 percent among high school players? , Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: I think that we need some additional research to really understand the extent to which the duration that someone plays football and may be exposed to repetitive brain trauma, the extent to which that relates to their risk of developing CTE. At this point, we can't really answer the question about whether or not there is a relationship, but we're working on it., Barbara Howard: It's very clear that this problem faced by players is at all levels of football — is there a way to make football safe?, , Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: So at this point with this study, we're unable to say for sure what types of hits to the head increase your risk to CTE. But, I think there are some common sense things we can do to make football safer. I can't really say at this point whether or not we can make football completely safe, but what we can do is eliminate some of the unnecessary repetitive hits to the head, and that will likely decrease the risk of CTE. Unfortunately, at this point it's a little too early to say. , Barbara Howard: If you had children, would you let your child play football?, Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: I played football in high school — I wrestled in college and got some concussions there, and I think I'm more or less cognitively intact so far. I think the important thing is to try and make the game as safe as possible with the information that we have. In terms of whether or not I'd let my kid play — I think in its current form, I probably wouldn't. But, I think there are some ways we can make the game safer, and I might change my mind in the future., Barbara Howard: Thanks for joining us, Dr. Daneshvar., Dr. Daniel Daneshvar: Thank you Barbara, it was a pleasure., Barbara Howard: That's Dr. Daniel Daneshvar from Boston University's Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Center. He is the co-author of a study on CTE that came out today in the journal of the American Medical Association. That study shows that of the 111 brains that were examined of dead NFL players, 110 showed signs of CTE.

Dave Hassman, who runs Boston Property Services a few doors down, remembered Cruz as a ""very nice gentleman."", “He was great to us, he was great to everyone in the neighborhood,"" Hassman said. ""He helped us with maintenance and did our window screens. We’ll just miss his smile.”, Customers like Korey Laznick will miss Cruz’s personal touch. Laznick says that’s hard to find., “An amazing operation, great local guy, takes care of everybody,"" Laznick said. ""He treated every day like it was his first day on the job. He cared about every customer. Whether it was a $.50 sale or a $500 sale, he wanted you to have the best experience you could have.”  , Because of that kind of service, Cruz’s store was named the 2017 Business of the Year by the Mission Hill Main Streets, with a ceremony attended by Mayor Marty Walsh., It’s a small business community that the city is helping to grow into a thriving community., There are 40,000 small businesses in the city that generate $15 billion in annual revenue. And, Boston officials are pushing to create more community-oriented businesses like AC hardware. Customers like Kory Laznick say small businesses like AC Hardware are priceless., “You don’t see operations like this in the field that exist anymore,"" Laznick said. ""They all closed down when big box came in.” , But for now, this neighborhood is focused on healing.  , Boston police arrested three men who are all being charged with first degree murder and weapons charges in connection with the shooting. Hassman hopes that brings some small sense of peace to Cruz’s family and says, although this is a blow, he and others are committed to staying in the community,, “In our shop, we’re not doing anything differently,"" he said. ""We're a little shook up with the recent events ... We’ll just be cautious and that’s all we can do."" , As for the store — it’s closed for now, and its future remains uncertain., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"

Today, the Roxbury clergyman brought together other faith leaders and local politicians, like city councilor and mayoral candidate Tito Jackson., Wall called on Gov. Charlie Baker, state officials and Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to, as he put it, work to create a citywide and community plan to stop the violence., “Politicians have good intentions,” Wall said, “but they’re not feeling this [violence] the way that we’re feeling this. They’re not going through the same trauma. The mayor and the police commissioner drive through this city with armed escorts in their SUV’s. So yes, they have good intentions, but they’re not doing the job that needs to be done.”, Wall pointed to more than two dozen homicides and many more shootings so far this year, most of them in the Roxbury and Dorchester neighborhoods. , , “If residents in Newton, Wellesley or even South Boston experienced 25 homicides in seven months, the elected officials would be called on the carpet,” Wall said in a statement., The pastor especially criticized the mayor’s office for a lack of preparation and for not involving people who have the greatest stake in ending the violence — pastors like him and other local activists and politicians., , Wall likened the recent summer spike in violence to Groundhog Day. Every year, he said, homicides go up when school lets out, and officials wring their hands but do little else., “The city calls the black pastors together. The pastors come out, three-quarters of whom do not deal with the population that they're concerned about, but it makes a good photo op and after the meeting the community applauds and says, ‘You're doing a good job,’"" Wall said., The mayor’s office said nothing can be further from the truth. They pointed to an anti-violence plan released this year with a host of different programs. They include a Junior Police League, sporting events, movie nights and activities like block parties and “coffee with a cop.”, A city hall spokesperson also said the mayor has reached out to the Massachusetts Association of Minority Law Enforcement Officers, known as MAMLEO. , On its website, the organization commends Mayor Walsh and Police Commissioner Bill Evans for taking time out of their busy schedules to attend a round table with the group. “We hope that this will open up dialogue between all parties,” the May 2017 posting says. “We may not always agree, but at least come to the table to work things out.” , Aaron Schachter is the Executive Producer of WGBH News.

732,[School Desk Diaries: First Year Teacher],"[High attrition rates, burnout, and lack of support have created a national teacher shortage. With low wages, long hours, and working with children, teaching is not a career path for everyone., One middle school teacher at a charter school in East Boston kept an audio diary of her first year out of college, and first year on the job. She asked us to not use her name to protect her job and future prospects., “I was living in Boston and working at a cafe and I needed a job paid more money,” she said. Then she I started applying for jobs and landed a gig at a charter school in East Boston. “This was the first one I got. A lot of it was just financial. There was rent to pay and I wanted to have salary.” She explained that for her and many of her peers, teaching served as a stop-gap and a resume builder, before landing a job in a chosen field, attending graduate school, or deciding on a career path., The job was particularly fulfilling on days when students gave enthusiastic responses to her lessons. “There are moments where the students get where I want them to get without me leading them there. It's just like sliver of the magic I bet really great teachers feel,” she said, “It makes me wonder if as a second year teacher, I would have more of those moments. And then as a third year teacher, if I would have even more.”, As the year continued on, these moments never became enough to stave off exasperation. The long hours were wearing her down and she felt a lack of guidance from more experienced teachers. On one train ride home from work she said, “I am feeling pretty demoralized right now. It's practically May, and I'm still having trouble,” she said, “My day is ending with the feeling pretty beat down by the students.”, During her last week of classes, she reflected on the lack of continuity for students. With new assistant teachers coming in and out of the classroom every year, she wondered if it made the students distrust her. “I wonder if they sense that teaching for somebody like me is a strategic career move, a stepping stone,” she said, “Maybe I'm doing this year of service, but ultimately the greater service is to myself.”, Even she was only in the school for a year, she developed close relationships with some students and families. One of these students approached her during her last week and asked if she’d be back in the fall. “I told her the truth,” said the teacher, “I said no. And she asked me to stay. She said, ‘Why don't you just come back next year?' I didn't know what to say.”, “It crystallizes the suspicion I have that I am abandoning these people,” she said. Based on her experience, and what she saw in the school, she thinks the system of hiring teachers in their first year out of college is a problem. “The adult in the room probably themselves doesn't really feel like much of an adult, and these young students’ intellectual development is left in the hands of somebody who is not trained to develop them intellectually,” she said., “It's a cliche to say, ‘Oh I learned more than my students,’ but in my case I've gained a lot more than my students have from my presence [in the school],” she said. “I've gained a line on my resume. I've gained connections. I've gained the ability to say I taught for a year and have people be impressed by that or say something like, ‘Oh teaching is so hard!’” She said her story is similar to many of her peers, who entered teaching straight out of college with no intention of pursuing it as a career. She learned that the “revolving door” of recently graduated teachers doesn’t benefit students in the short-term or districts in the long-term., “The only circumstance in which I believe people should be teaching right out of college is with adequate and very intentional support for more or less the entire year,” she said. “And I think I got some of that, but I don't think that there are wider structures in place to give me all of that.”, WGBH News’ coverage of K-12 education is made possible with support from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation.  , Tristan Cimini is a former producer for WGBH News’ K-12 Education Desk.

743,[New Report Claims Gordon College Mishandled Sexual Assault Complaints],"[Click on the audio player above to listen to the audio version of this interview. , Barbara Howard: Gordon College is a small Christian school in the north shore town of Wenham. It has 1,700 students, and again, it is drawing scrutiny — this time for the way it has handled reports of sexual assault., WGBH Radio’s Cristina Quinn and Joshua Eaton of the online news site ThinkProgress have been looking into complaints against Gordon for more than a year. Cristina is with me now in the studio. Thanks for coming in, Cristina., Cristina Quinn: Thanks for having me, Barbara., Barbara Howard: So Gordon has been roiled in controversy over its stance on homosexuality, and we'll get into that a little later, but what's the latest on reports of sexual assault?, Cristina Quinn: Right, well, we spoke with 10 women about their experiences with sexual assault at the school, and these are women who are current and former Gordon College students. Most of them said they believe the school system to investigate assaults failed them. Women who reported assaults often lost their faith, left the school. One woman even gave up a full scholarship, and all of them struggled with the emotional fallout., Barbara Howard: Well, what was it in the college’s response that caused that?, Cristina Quinn: Well, under Title IX federal law, schools have to address sexual assault or sexual harassment allegations with certain protocols. Gordon College has a Title IX team made up of administrators. In some cases we looked at, that team investigated charges of assault, but often for a variety of reasons these cases fizzled out., Barbara Howard: Well, like what? Can you give me some examples?, Cristina Quinn: Well, there’s a student who enrolled in Gordon College after being expelled from Eastern Nazarene College in Quincy for allegedly raping a fellow student. After he got to Gordon, three women say he raped or assaulted them, and he continued attending classes at Gordon until last summer. That was when he was arrested for allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old girl in Brockton. In another case, a woman confessed to the school that she had sexually assaulted her roommate, another woman. She told us that she was worried about her behavior and worried about her roommate, and she says the school told her that there was so little time left in the school year she had to stay in her room and, you know, by the way, have your roommate give us a call if she needs something., Barbara Howard: So she self-reported, it sounds like?, Cristina Quinn: Yeah, she turned herself in. And we also spoke with the victim, and the victim later asked an administrator in an email if the school would have handled the assault differently if it had happened between a man and a woman instead of two women, and he responded that yes, in fact they would have addressed it more seriously if the alleged perpetrator was a man., Barbara Howard: Well since then, has anything been done at Gordon to improve the practices, the responses?, Cristina Quinn: So in 2014, the Department of Education put out guidelines for these kinds of cases, and so Gordon started revising its policies and training faculty and staff on Title IX. But even after that, students say there have been problems. For example, there’s one student who has been identified by six individual women who say that he sexually assaulted or harassed them. Gordon College investigated and concluded that he does pose a threat to women. However, the punishment for these alleged assaults was that he had to move off campus, and he was still allowed to be on campus for his classes. Eventually he was suspended for something unrelated., Barbara Howard: So now, you had mentioned that one of the alleged perpetrators was a transfer student from Eastern Nazarene College, where he allegedly raped another woman. Did Gordon College even know about those accusations?, Cristina Quinn: So we don’t know if Gordon College knew. Easter Nazarene told us that they don’t include disciplinary actions, including expulsions for sexual assault, on student transcripts. And in Massachusetts, they are not required to., Barbara Howard: Well that’s pretty surprising. I think it’s fair to say that sexual assaults do happen on many, many college campuses. Is there anything, though, about a Christian college that makes it different?, Cristina Quinn: Christian universities that place a premium on sexual purity have unique challenges. So at Gordon, students can be disciplined for having premarital sex, for being in same-sex relationships, or any drinking, even if they’re over 21, and that’s because the school sees those acts as sinful. So imagine if you’re drinking and you’re raped. You may not want to come forward because you’re afraid that you’ll be disciplined for drinking. The school says it has an amnesty policy for drinking and sexual assault, and it is on their website, you just have to look for it. Students we spoke with, however, didn’t seem to know about it or told us they just ... they didn’t believe it., Barbara Howard: Now this isn’t the first time Gordon College has been in the news, right?, Cristina Quinn: That’s right. Back in 2014, Gordon made national news when its president D. Michael Lindsay joined other Christian leaders in calling for a religious exemption to federal workplace protections for gay and transgender workers. So that set off a wave of protests on the campus. Most recently, the entire faculty senate resigned after the president overrode their unanimous recommendation for a professor’s promotion. This particular professor had been openly critical of the school’s position against hiring gay and transgendered workers. So there’s a lot of upheaval that continues on campus.  , Barbara Howard: OK. Thanks for joining us, Cristina., Cristina Quinn: Thanks, Barbara., Barbara Howard: That's WGBH Radio's Cristina Quinn. She and reporter Joshua Eaton have been investigating sexual assault at Gordon College in Wenham. Their findings have been published on the website ThinkProgress.

747,[Hingham Parents Speak Out About Son’s Suicide During SWAT Standoff],"[On July 8, 26-year-old Austin Reeves arrived at his Hingham home, extremely distraught after a phone conversation with his ex-girlfriend. In the call, he mentioned a gun, which led his ex-girlfriend to call police and ask them to check on him. When a Hingham officer called to ask about his well-being, Austin told his family he needed time alone and went upstairs. His father, however, was worried his son would hurt himself and called police for help., Police arrived and, after Austin’s ex-girlfriend reportedly told them that he’d said that anyone who went upstairs to get him would be hurt, his mother and father were removed from the scene and a SWAT team was called in for backup. Dozens of forces from neighboring towns with high-tech, military-style equipment arrived – some wearing camouflage and carrying rifles., Ten hours after the ordeal began, police told the mother and father that their son had shot and killed himself during the standoff. Today, they maintain Austin’s death was 100 percent preventable, particularly if authorities had exercised the restraint that Russell and Kate had beseeched them to., “I wanted [the police] to say one thing: ‘Austin, we know about this and you’ve done nothing wrong,’” explained Russell Reeves when he and his wife, Kate Harrison, joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston. “I said … ‘Don’t back him into the corner; he’s going to hurt himself.’”, Adding to their skepticism of police’s approach was their frustration at having been separated from the scene, as Reeves and Harrison were temporarily moved to a repurposed ambulance with no access to their son., “As soon as the police were called — and we called them looking for some help — we were removed,” said Harrison, whose attempts to communicate with Austin via text message went unanswered and whose request to speak directly with him was rebuffed. “They said … that the protocol would not allow this.”, Reeves agreed that his wife’s suggestion would have been the sensible course, recounting, “I told the police … ‘If you’re concerned … put Kevlar on and stand back and let the mother talk to him … he’s not going to hurt his mother.’”, , No such peaceful intervention was offered, though, and the situation escalated into a lengthy standoff during which lights were flashed and windows were broken., “Ten hours of aggravation,” said a visibly distraught Reeves. “I can’t tell you how many times I told these police, ‘You’re aggravating my son.

Lynch: House Republicans Are 'Not Happy' Their Controversial Votes Didn't Pay Off],"[House Republicans who went out on a limb to vote in favor of the GOP health care bill aren’t pleased it didn’t pay off, according to Congressman Stephen Lynch., “In the minds of maybe 20 to 25 percent of the Republican House members, they were not happy about having to take a tough vote in favor of a bad bill that’s going nowhere,” he said, speaking on Boston Public Radio Wednesday. “I think they were figuring that if a more moderate version came back, they could vote for that version and sort of pay for their prior sins.”, House Republicans never got that chance, since the bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act sputtered and died before making it to a vote on the Senate floor., , Later, House majority leader Mitch McConnell threatened to put a repeal to a vote without a plan for replacement, but that, too, never gained momentum., Lynch said some of the committees plan to go back to the drawing board for a bipartisan solution that will garner enough votes, though he voiced skepticism at the prospect., “They’re going to keep at it, but the problem is that even the Democrats realize that we’ve got to try to fix some of the problems with the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “Unfortunately, what the Republicans have suggested so far doesn’t really meet our needs.”, He proposed returning to an earlier version of the Affordable Care Act from the House that he said won over 300 votes there, including many from Republicans., Lynch said the House version created competition for insurance companies and states, and prevented more taxes on health care., “It took away the antitrust exemption for insurance companies which forced them to compete; number two, it created a state-sponsored public option so that the states themselves, in markets where there weren’t enough insurance companies... could actually get in the game and offer a low-cost, bare budget health care plan which also creates competition, and then thirdly it prohibited additional taxes on health care,” explained Lynch., He said the House version solves some of the Affordable Care Act’s problems, and already has buy-in from across the aisle., “Let’s start with that, because we already know we have a bunch of Republicans on record having voted for that,” he said. “That’s a good start.”, Congressman Stephen Lynch represents the 8th district.

750,"[For One Day A Year, The Charles Welcomes Swimmers]","[Last week, the EPA released a report downgrading the water quality of the Charles River from a B+ to a B. But that didn’t stop hundreds of people from jumping in the river and going for a swim Tuesday. Nobody seemed to hesitate as they enthusiastically leapt into the Charles., As Sally Graham of Dorchester waited her turn to take the plunge, she said this was something of a bucket list item., “When I first moved here, it was almost like Lake Erie,"" she said. ""You could almost set it on fire. And the fact that there's been a huge investment in the infrastructure to clean it up, I think is very exciting."" She also said she had no concerns about it. “I don’t swallow. I wear goggles. I wear earplugs. So most of the places where I could develop infections are covered."", , As he came out of the water, Josh Posner seemed exhilarated. “The water is great,"" he said. ""Nice and fresh. Great temperature.” He pointed out, Boston’s a city with a river just right there.,  “We see it everyday,"" he said. ""Who wouldn’t want to dive in?”, That’s what the Charles River Conservancy believes. SJ Port is with the group, and says although this is just a one-day-a-year event, they’re hoping in the future it will be more regular.  , “We are proposing a designated spot off of the public dock in North Point Park,"" Port said. ""And the reason we're doing it there and not in the Esplanade where we've held our City Splash events is that this is a prime boating area down here, and we'd like to keep the boaters as our friends."", The question people might have, of course: Is it safe to swim in the Charles? Port says yes., ""It is safe to swim in the Charles, as long as the water quality is tested beforehand,” she said.,  Port wasn't discouraged by last week’s report that downgraded the Charles from a B+ for water quality to a B. The EPA report was based on monthly water sample tests., “Some of those samples this year were taken during or after rain events. Rain events, we know, cause a rise in E. coli and other bacteria in the river because you've got all the stuff washing off the roads and off the parks into the river,"" she said. ""And it also includes winter months, when most of us aren't interested in swimming."", , The Conservancy hired Max Rome, an environmental engineering graduate student at Northeastern to test the water quality every day this summer. Rome pointed out that Boston has forgotten that back in 1940, people used to swim in the river off Magazine Beach in Cambridge on hot summer days., “What happened since then was that as we started caring more and more about sanitation, perversely we built more and more wastewater treatment plants and sewer systems that ended up dumping into the river,"" he said., In recent years, though, since the cleanup of Boston Harbor began, we stopped that kind of dumping and the water quality has improved., “And then the next place after that is, where are there places where our storm water system is connected to our sanitary sewer system?"" Rome said. ""That's kind of the trickier problem. Places where those systems are connected, when it rains really hard, some sewage can end up getting washed out into the Charles River. And basically, Cambridge, Boston have done a really good job. As you go father up the river, there's a lot more work that needs to be done."", So, it’s actually cleaner in the more urban area., , Another concern these days is outbreaks of a blue-green algae known as cyanobacteria, which is pretty toxic. But Rome says that tends to show up later in the summer, when the water gets warmer., “We test every single day, we're kind of looking under the microscope to see who's swimming around in there. And there's not much to speak of yet.”, It was a sunny one, and pretty hot. Port gave one more guarantee this was a good idea: “This is safe for your health, it is good for your health,"" she said., And that was enough to encourage anyone, including a radio reporter, to jump in the Charles., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

769,[Fired Boston Police Officer Reinstated By State's Highest Court],"[Barbara Howard: A Boston police officer who has been fired two times for using excessive force has been ordered reinstated again, this time by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The first time, back in 1995, Officer David C. Williams nearly killed an undercover police officer, mistaking him for a criminal. He was fired, but reinstated by an arbitrator. The second firing stems from an incident in 2009. Williams, accused of using excessive force after he reportedly put a choke hold on a man during an arrest in Boston’s North End. On the line to talk about the ruling to reinstate Williams is WGBH News legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed. Hi Daniel., Daniel Medwed: Hi Barbara., Barbara Howard: Well, in making that ruling yesterday, the Supreme Judicial Court effectively ruled that the Boston Police Department does not have rules that explicitly forbid choke holds. What do you make of that?, Daniel Medwed: That’s’ exactly right. The Boston Police Department’s own use of force policies are very subjective. They allow the use of nonlethal force as long as that force is reasonable. There’s not a general and explicit ban on choke holds. So in other words, as long as the arbitrator here found that Mr. Williams engaged in force that was reasonable, then the BPD was found not to have a justification to require firing him., Barbara Howard: Well in writing the opinion, Justice Geraldine Hines said “the Court is troubled by the prospect that any use of force not explicitly prohibited by a rule of conduct is essentially unreviewable.” Is that what you’re talking about?, Daniel Medwed: Absolutely. The entire structure is set up to give arbitrators a lot of power in deciding whether or not a termination is justified, because the use of force policies are so open-ended, they’re so subjective, they leave a lot of room for interpretation, and ultimately that interpretation belongs to the arbitrators. The SJC in this opinion by Justice Hines seemed to express frustration between the lines with the inability of the court to overturn or look anew at those arbitrators' decisions., Barbara Howard: And you’re right about the arbitrator having a lot of power on this. It should be noted that 72 percent of discipline that’s meted out by the commissioner, the police commissioner, Evans, is overturned in arbitration. 72 percent, that’s according to research that was conducted last year by Northeastern University students in cooperation with reporter Mike Beaudet of WCVB television. What do you make of that?, Daniel Medwed: That’s a very powerful figure, and it shows that in the balance of power between the police union and the police department, it seems like the union might be winning when officers are terminated, the union-backed candidates will then have a very good likelihood of success through arbitration. Perhaps beefing up the use of force policies or making more explicit some of the rules could make it harder for arbitrators to reverse these termination decisions., Barbara Howard: Now the judge went on to write, and I quote, “because choke holds are unpredictably lethal, both officers and the public deserve a bright line rule.” Now what does she mean by that?, Daniel Medwed: I think Justice Hines means that the Boston Police Department should forbid all choke holds under any circumstances because of their unpredictable nature., Barbara Howard: Well this ruling from the SJC has dealt a real blow to public confidence in the police department, when even the police department itself seems not to be able to get rid of an officer who has been fired by them twice., Daniel Medwed: Absolutely. And one of the telling issues in this opinion was when Justice Hines criticized the Boston Police Department itself for not investigating this allegation, the allegation against Officer Williams, with alacrity. The person who was injured in the North End filed a complaint, but it languished, it looks like for about a year before the BPD really did anything about it. So on the one hand we can look at this and say, poor Boston Police Department, they can’t even fire their own officers. But on the other hand we can look at it and say, maybe if the BPD had investigated this more quickly and more thoroughly, it could have reached a different result., Barbara Howard: What are the chances that this officer, David C. Williams, will actually be out on the street again in uniform, do you think?, Daniel Medwed: I would be shocked if he ever ended up on patrol again. Maybe he would have a desk job, or more likely he’d reach some type of settlement with the police department in exchange for his resignation., Barbara Howard: Thanks, Daniel., Daniel Medwed: Thank you, Barbara., Barbara Howard: That’s WGBH News legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed.,  , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
770,"[This Company Is Like Uber, But For Garbage]","[You might think that a van stuffed with gallons and gallons of garbage — literal garbage, as in hundreds of pounds of celery tops, onion skins, orange peels and soggy oats — would stink. Would reek, even. Instead, it only smells faintly sweet, and earthy, and a little bit like coffee beans., Emma Brown is the one driving this van (which is named “Miley,” by the way) and as she maneuvers it down Somerville’s narrower-than-narrower one-way streets, her eyes scan each porch and stoop for the sight of a bucket. These buckets — unassuming white plastic, with a simple stenciled label — are the reason why she’s here., Suddenly, she spots one., “There she is,” she mutters quietly, and guides Miley over to the curb. Brown hops out, grabs an empty bucket from the stacks piled in the van, and scurries to replace the one she’s just zeroed in on. Then she climbs back into the driver’s seat and keeps going., Now, this is pretty odd behavior, which is why people come up to her all the time and ask her what she’s doing. Then, Brown patiently explains: she works for a company called Bootstrap Compost, which takes its customers’ food waste, converts it into compost, and then delivers it right back to their door (or, if preferred, donates it to a school or park in the area). If you were to use the parlance so popular in Silicon Valley these days, you might say it’s a little bit like Uber — but for trash., People are often incredulous at first, she admits. But, luckily for Bootstrap, Brown is an indefatigable compost evangelist., “Using compost — there’s no shortage of reasons why you should,” she said. , , First of all, there are the big-picture environmental benefits. Americans waste a staggering amount of food every year: nearly half of all that is grown, according to a 2016 report from The Guardian. When waste like that goes into a landfill and decomposes, it emits methane, a greenhouse gas, which contributes to the warming of the planet. Turn that waste into compost instead, however, and methane production is significantly reduced., Not only that, but some studies suggest that using compost can actually capture and store carbon that’s already in the air. One study from U.C. Berkeley found that spreading compost over just 5 percent of California’s grazing lands could capture a year’s worth of carbon emissions from the state’s farming and forestry industries, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. , But there’s a personal, practical reason to use it, too: plants love the stuff. Using compost adds nutritional value to the soil, which reduces the need to use chemical fertilizers on plants and cuts down on the amount of water needed to irrigate them.  , “You get happier, healthier plants,” Brown said. “You’re not just using a bunch of weird, fake chemicals on things you eventually want to eat.”, She’s not the only one who thinks this way. When Bootstrap started in 2011, they had only 12 subscribers, according to co-founder Igor Kharitonenkov. Now, they have over 2,000, and they’re — pardon the pun — growing., They’re not the only ones. Similar services like Garden to Garbage, a Maine-based company, and CityCompost have popped up to serve area residents eager to do their part, but without the space or know-how to do so. Local governments have also experimented with compost programs. In 2014, Boston set up dropboxes for food scraps at five locations around the city — an initiative they dubbed “Project Oscar” after the Sesame Street character who lives in a trash can. Cambridge even launched a curbside compost collection program in 2015, which is still going strong, albeit on a limited route., Still, the numbers of people making and using compost overall are relatively low, something that Kharitonenkov hopes he and Bootstrap can start to change., “We’re trying to reach the folks on the outskirts and bring them into the herd,” he said., In the meantime, Brown keeps making her compost runs. Once she’s finished collecting buckets, she’ll take them back to Bootstrap’s headquarters in Malden, where they filter out contaminants like meat bones (which attract unwanted vermin), plastics and even silverware. From there, they ship everything to a farm in Saugus, where it’s ripened into usable compost., Then, of course, Brown — and Miley — hit the road all over again., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

777,[Scientists Try to Predict Sea Level Rise By Looking At End of Last Ice Age],"[Scientists would like to know how quickly ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland will melt as a result of climate change, and how much that will contribute to a rise in sea levels. And one way they’re figuring that out is by looking at how glaciers melted right here in New England, thousands of years ago., For geologists, every hike is something of a treasure hunt. When you understand geological history, every twist in a trail reveals a fascinating new relic from another era. A team hiking Massachusetts’ tallest mountain, Mt. Greylock in the Berkshires, recently was looking for something specific., “We are here searching for boulders,” said Jeremy Shakun of Boston College. “Glacially dropped boulders that have been sitting around for probably fifteen thousand years or so, since last ice age ended.”, And just how that ice age ended – and how that increased sea levels - is what they’d like to figure out. Back then, North America was covered it the biggest ice sheet in the world., “I mean, picture Antarctica in your mind today,"" Shakun said. ""You just see a huge, featureless white landscape of ice covering everything. That’s what this would have been like.”, ,  , The end of the last ice age was caused by a tilt in the earth’s axis. Today, scientists agree the climate is changing because of an increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “So this time the cause is different, but the way it plays out -- warming planet, melting ice, rising sea levels -- it’s the same bottom line,"" he said. ""Just a different trigger.”, Shakun explained it’s glaciers on land, like the one that used to be here in New England and that now exist in Greenland and Antarctica, that cause sea level rise when they melt. Melting sea ice, he said, is like ice cubes in a glass. When they melt, the water level in the glass doesn’t go up. The biggest problem is ice sitting up on the land. “As it melts, it’s pouring more and more water into the ocean,"" Shakun said. ""Adding more water to the glass. That’s the stuff that raises sea level. So that’s the stuff we’re really concerned about.”, And that’s what’s so important about understanding how quickly the last ice age ended. The secret is hidden in the rocks., Off the trail, behind a mess of vines and brush, Shakun and a geologist from nearby Williams College found what they were looking for: a boulder with milky looking veins of quartz running through it., Shakun called over BC masters student Chris Halstead., “Oh yeah, that’s pretty good,"" Halstead said when he saw it. ""Not a bad surface to sample on.” They took some measurements, pulled out a hammer and a chisel, and started chipping away at the quartz., , All around us, Shakun explained, there are cosmic rays – radiation from space, that you can’t see or feel, but they’re there. And when those cosmic rays come in contact with quartz, they form a rare isotope called Beryllium 10. And by measuring how much Beryllium 10 is in the rocks, they can tell how long it’s been since a glacier melted, exposing the rocks to the radiation., “What we would imagine here is that as the ice age was ending, the top of the mountain was the first with the first part to get exposed as the ice surface melted down into the valley,"" he said. ""So we would expect the rocks up here at the tip to have more Beryllium 10 than the rocks do at the bottom that didn't thaw out of the ice until later.”, If there’s about the same amount of Beryllium 10 in rocks at the top of the mountain as there is in the rocks at the bottom, the ice melted quickly. “If there’s a big difference,"" he said, ""then the ice must have thinned slowly, and it was much more gradual melt out of the big glaciers.”, They took turns chipping at the rock, because it was pretty tiring. Also, the black flies were brutal. And doing this work can be a bit dangerous -- it's easy to hit a hand with the hammer. After 15 minutes or so of chipping away, they had enough for a good sample. And they headed back out on the trail to get more samples at different elevations., They’ll be at it for months, getting rocks at mountains all over New England, which they’ll crush, extract the quartz, and measure how much Beryllium 10 is in each. Ultimately, Shakun said they’ll have a 3D computer model illustrating how the ice sheets here collapsed thousands of years ago. And that’ll provide just a glimpse into what we may be in for now with a changing climate.  , “We can use the past to help guide the future,"" Shakun said. ""But to some extent, we’re doing a really wild experiment with the climate that doesn't have precedent.”, Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

794,[Making A More Perfect Intersection ],"[A major construction project is just getting underway in Boston: The bridge where Commonwealth Avenue passes over the Mass Pike is being replaced., From the sky, the intersection looks a bit like an asterisk. Smack dab in the middle of Boston University’s campus, roads are converging from all sides., It’s where the BU bridge meets Commonwealth Avenue’s eight lanes of traffic. The Green Line chugs down the middle. The Mass Pike runs underneath., The Massachusetts’ Department of Transportation, or MassDOT, says this big intersection on top of a highway is “structurally deficient.”, Over the course of the next few years, the construction will affect the highway, the T and Amtrak, as well as all the pedestrians, bicyclists and drivers around BU's urban campus., But before all the detours start, we asked Eran Ben-Joseph, a professor at MIT and the head of MIT’s Department of Urban Studies and Planning, to visit this jumble of streets and see what can be done to make it a more perfect intersection., Ben-Joseph gave the intersection a grade: a D, or a D+ with grade inflation., MassDOT has set out to fix it — making a bridge that they say should last 75 years — but Ben-Joseph looks at the intersection on top of the bridge. He says the first step is to answer a question: ""Who are you trying to mainly serve in this place?"", Is it the cars? The trains? The bikes?, Ben-Joseph says here, there’s a case to be made for prioritizing the thousands of students and pedestrians who cross the intersection daily. Pedestrians agree, calling the intersection “a disaster,” “dangerous,” and “tricky to navigate.”, Ben-Joseph says you could make this intersection better with just a few little design changes. Here are three of his suggestions:, No. 1: Take space away from cars., Ben-Joseph says as a driver approaches the intersection, the whole street could get thinner. ""If the lane was narrower or there were fewer lanes, the cars would have to go slower,” he said., No. 2: Change the intersection's surface., “The material itself is asphalt and it’s dark and it’s black,” Ben-Joseph pointed out. “We often say that psychologically a driver feels this is a place to drive.”, If the designers want to make drivers cautious, Ben-Joseph says, they can paint the intersection a lighter color, they can make it out of bricks, or they can elevate the whole intersection, like a big, wide speed bump., “Make it with other materials, it feels very different,"" he added., No. 3: Landscaping., Ben-Joseph says things like trees and benches can help., “The design elements that make the place feel more urban will actually slow down traffic, will slow down the cars,"" he said., MassDOT has been studying this intersection for years. Some things will change and some won't., ""This is literally a fight for inches in some cases when you are trying to lay out where a sidewalk should go, where a bike lane should go,” said Jonathan Gulliver, acting MassDOT Highway Administrator. “We are working really hard to reduce the conflict that you see right now.”, Gulliver says on the BU bridge they did make the lanes narrower, but they won’t be doing that on Commonwealth Avenue. Nor is the black asphalt going to change., As for trees? Kathy Barr, an engineer on the project, says it's hard. “The bridge itself — it’s a concrete steel structure, you can’t add a whole lot of trees and those things.”, But on Commonwealth Avenue on either side of the bridge, some trees have already been added and there are plans to plant more. Plus, Barr says they’ve taken this opportunity to upgrade the bike lanes and add signals just for bikes., So, it may not turn into the perfect intersection — for pedestrians, cyclists or drivers — but it will be getting better and, soon, it will be structurally sound., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

802,[How To Prevent Window Falls In Boston And Surrounding Areas],"[A 6-year-old Dorchester child fell out a third-story window early this morning. Reports are that she's expected to recover, but it’s the latest in a rash of kids falling out of windows now that the weather has turned warm. On Monday, a 5-year-old in Brookline died from her injuries, and just two days before that, in Quincy, a 5-year-old boy survived a fall from a seven-story window. That followed two other window falls: a 3-year-old Framingham girl and 2-year-old Chelsea boy, both expected to recover. The Centers for Disease control says falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injuries. WGBH's All Things Considered host Barbara Howard spoke about this and how to prevent falls with Eugene Barros from the Boston Public Health Commission., Barbara Howard: According to the group, Kids Safe Worldwide, window falls account for eight deaths and approximately 3,000 injuries among children 5 and under each year nationally. You say that most of these falls take place in low-income areas. Why is that?, Eugene Barros: What the statistics show is that minorities, African-Americans and Latinos, tend to live in rental housing., Barbara Howard: In New York, landlords with three or more units are required to provide window guards when there are kids under 10 living in the unit. Why doesn’t Boston or other surrounding communities have rules like that?, Eugene Barros: Boston has a city ordinance that strongly encourages landlords to install window guards, but in Massachusetts, our housing and sanitary code does not mandate that., Barbara Howard: Public housing run by the City of Boston does allow parents with kids under a certain age to get window guards by request. Is that correct?, Eugene Barros: Yes. The Boston Housing Authority will install them in any unit with children under 7., Barbara Howard: What about Section 8 housing or other housing provided for low income families?, Eugene Barros: Window guards are not mandated in Section 8 housing because those are private landlords, but we work closely with them to promote window guards and make them available at a discounted rate so that landlords can install them in their units., Barbara Howard: What about families that are not low-income but live in high-rises? Are those landlords required to install window guards when small children are present?, Eugene Barros: They are not, but based on our experience, most large landlords voluntarily put them in once they’re asked by their tenants., Barbara Howard: New York City requires them to be put in place if tenants ask for them. Is there any similar legislation pending here in Massachusetts?, Eugene Barros: The sanitary code is up for revision and that’s one of the things we will consider inserting into the sanitary code. It’s not in the code now, but we think it’s a no-brainer that window guards should be in every unit that’s over 12 feet off the ground when a child under 7 lives there., Barbara Howard: If you’re a parent and you want to put these window guards up, can your landlord or condo association prevent you from doing that?, Eugene Barros: Different condo associations have different bylaws. Usually tenants have to ask their landlords because the bars do need to be installed in the bottom of the window, but in our experience, if tenants want to buy them, landlords won’t prevent them from installing them., Barbara Howard: How much do window guards cost?, Eugene Barros: They are somewhat expensive. It varies on the window size. They can run anywhere from $35 to $75. In the City of Boston, we subsidize them and make low-cost window guards available for Boston residents at a 50 percent discount. , Barbara Howard: Do you have any advice for parents? What are some common sense things they could be doing?, Eugene Barros: Number one is to install window guards if they live on any floor that’s over 12 feet off the ground if they have children under 7, and just to make sure that people understand that window screens may keep flies and insects outside of the house, but they do not keep children inside. We recommend that people keep furniture away from windows, like beds and other things that kids can climb on, and then opening windows only from the top is always a good practice., The City of Boston subsidizes window guards sold through the non-profit Boston Building Resources., The Boston Public Health Commission offers safety tips and guidelines for preventing window falls., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

He has made himself visible and accountable — even assisting border authorities in keeping unsavory individuals out of the United States. He believes this visibility may be one of the reasons he’s been targeted for deportation., “It’s a lot harder to find people that are hiding from you,” said Micheroni, who works in the Executive Office for Immigration Review at Cameron Law Offices. “When this happens, it also discourages people from turning themselves in.”, While Rodriguez’s diligence may have proven detrimental with immigration authorities, it has garnered support from many allies. Several parties, including his workers’ union, politicians and even some prominent MIT faculty, have recognized his dedication and thrown their support behind his cause., “I didn’t expect to have everybody help me with this case,” said Rodriguez, citing his unyielding work ethic as the cause for such outreach. “I always work an extra mile in my job, and some people just do what they have to do; they don’t try and do the rest.”, The loss felt in Rodriguez’s workplace, however, would not compare to the effects that deportation would have on his family, which includes his three children — all of whom are American citizens — and his wife, who is currently expecting another baby. Micheroni outlined the grim circumstances that would follow a removal from the United States, which would also mean that Francisco and his wife would not be allowed to travel between the two countries to visit each other for at least ten years., “I worry about that because they depend on me,” said Rodriguez. “We … take nothing from the government … I’m just trying to live a regular, American life.”, Rodriguez is expected to report to ICE agents again, possibly for the final time, on July 13. ]"

814,[After Bella Bond: Keeping Kids Safe When Parents Are Drug Addicts],"[Click the audio player above to listen to the radio version of this story., As he made the case to convict Michael McCarthy of murder, prosecutors in the Bella Bond murder trial acknowledged another culprit:  heroin addiction., “If there weren’t heroin in this case,” Suffolk County assistant district attorney David Deakin told the jury, “there would be no case.”, “If there weren’t heroin in this case, there would be no case.”, McCarthy is the ex-boyfriend of Bella Bond’s mother. Prosecutors say the pair lived in a haze of heroin addiction. As the opioid epidemic continues to ravage lives, so does the debate over how the state can best protect the children of addicts., In the two years since Bella Bond’s body was discovered washed up on a Boston Harbor beach, there’s been a sharp uptick in the number of Massachusetts kids in foster care. And while there’s broad agreement that safety must be the priority, some child welfare advocates say foster care is not always the best solution., “It’s not just a choice between keeping kids at home where they’re at risk or removing them where they’re safe,” said Matt Stone, the executive director of Youth Villages.  , Stone’s organization contracts with the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to provide intense family support services so children can live at home instead of foster care., “It does a lot of trauma and damage to children to be removed from families,” said Stone. “Most families can be taught to live together safely and successfully.”, “Most families can be taught to live together safely and successfully.”, Nicole Smith and her three children are living together with help from Youth Villages. Smith is a heroin addict and says she was sober for six years. When her youngest child, a four-year-old boy, went to school, she says she relapsed., “I was used to being a full-time Mom, and all my kids were suddenly in school and I was left with too much time on my own,” said Smith.  “I was so used to go go, go, go and that’s what kept me sober.”, Last January, Smith’s four-year-old was found alone outside the family’s Webster apartment. DCF was called in and placed all three kids in foster care., “If I hadn’t done some of the things I’d done, they wouldn’t have had the right to come in here and take my kids,” said Smith., Smith’s children returned home in February and Nicole Shea, a social worker from Youth Villages, became constant fixture in the family’s life. She’s at their apartment three times a week to help Smith develop strategies for managing both her children and her addiction. She also has unlimited access to the home and regularly looks through drawers and cabinets for evidence of drug use., “We’ve never found anything during our safety sweeps,” said Shea.  “She [Smith] does what she has to do. She goes to the methadone clinic. She keeps all of her scheduled appointments.”, Only a fraction of DCF’s overall budget funds intensive programs like the one that has helped keep Smith and her kids together. Advocates say moving funds from foster care to intensive family support programs would enable kids to live with their parents and reduce the burden on an overwhelmed foster care system. , Yet, even for the most motivated person, addiction is tough to beat., “I think the opioid epidemic represents a unique risk factor,” said Maria Mossaides, the state’s child advocate. She supports efforts to keep families together, but defends the uptick in foster care placements. She points to research that suggests addiction changes the way a parent relates to a child., “It takes a full year to 18 months after you’ve given up drugs and are in recovery for your brain to return to what they consider to be a normal state,” said Mossaides.      , “I think the opioid epidemic represents a unique risk factor.”, Nicole Smith says she’s a changed person, and she has new methods of coping with the issues she now believes drive her addiction.  , “I’m an addict, I’m in recovery,” said Smith, “but it doesn’t mean that’s all I am.”, Shea says Smith has progressed to the point her family no longer needs intensive support. Making the call to let the kids stay and step away from a family where addiction is an issue means accepting some level of risk and relying on professional judgement., “You just get to know the family,” said Shea. “I think, honestly, in this situation, the best place for the children is home with the family.”, Smith and her kids won’t be completely on their own. DCF will continue monthly check-ins for an undetermined length of time. , Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

Why are they opposing statute of limitations laws across the country? … Because they don't want the truth to be revealed, and they're playing a long game.”, “I think the Vatican still believes this is a creation of the media, and it is not a systemic problem,” Rezendes said. “Despite all the evidence — and with scandals in country after country after country — I think there are a lot of people at the Vatican who just have their feet firmly planted in the idea that this is a media creation and, if they just wait long enough, it will go away.”, “We just have to keep doing what we're doing,” said Garabedian. “Laws have to be changed. Documents have to be produced. The truth has to be revealed. Victims have to keep fighting.”, “I do hope the church changes,” said Rezendes. “I think it's quite possible.

820,[State Lawmakers Face Self-Imposed Deadline On Changes To Mass. Marijuana Law],"[The clock is ticking on state lawmakers who are looking to make changes to Massachusetts' marijuana law. A conference committee made up of legislators from the Senate and House are trying to draft a compromise bill that would reconcile differences in separate measures already passed by each chamber. The committee has given itself until tomorrow to come to an agreement. WGBH State House reporter Mike Deehan discussed the committee's efforts with WGBH All Things Considered host Barbara Howard., Barbara Howard: This is 89-7 WGBH. I'm Barbara Howard. Lawmakers from the Massachusetts House and Senate have been trying to hammer out a compromise on changes to the state's law legalizing recreational marijuana. It was  approved by voters in last November's election, but they are fast approaching a self-imposed deadline. Members of the conference committee working on the changes have given themselves until tomorrow  to come to an agreement. Joining us from Beacon Hill is WGBH State House reporter Mike Deehan, who's been following this. Hi Mike., Mike Deehan: Hey, how are you?, Barbara Howard: I’m doing alright. So, this conference committee is trying to bridge the gap between changes that the House wants and changes that the Senate wants when it comes to the marijuana law. How do the House and Senate plans differ?, Mike Deehan: One big way they differ is in local control and that kind of boils down to how a city or town could ban a pot shop from opening there. The House bill actually would allow a city council or a town meeting, things like that, to make the decision to ban a shop from opening. The law as is right now would require a ballot question and all voting citizens to make that call. Another big change is in the different tax rates. The House wants a 28 percent tax at the point of sale on marijuana products. The Senate wants the same rate that’s in the law right now, which is 12 percent., Barbara Howard: Well why is the House pushing for that higher rate?, Mike Deehan: The House says that they need to start high and then maybe work their way down low if need be, if there’s a problem with the high tax. There’s a lot of concern in cities and towns and amongst the membership about the start-up costs of this new industry and what it will mean for police departments, for school districts, for education things, for studies to look at how to prevent DUI, things like that. They anticipate using that extra revenue for all sorts of different enforcement and regulation reasons., Barbara Howard: If the House and Senate ever do come to agreement, which they have like 24 hours to do, what would a compromise look like?, Mike Deehan: On the tax rate they’ll probably meet in the middle. I don’t think that there’s too big a surprise if they come out with a 20 to 25 percent tax, something along those lines just to make it easy. One thing they might do is give the local option tax a boost, which would give an incentive for those towns to not ban shops. If they say, you can have 6 percent for the tax revenue, well then you’re incentivized to not shut down opening up the shops. As far as the local control though, it’s kind of complicated, and we’re hearing in the State House now that that’s kind of the hang-up., Barbara Howard: Okay. Well now they’ve given themselves until tomorrow. Why did the lawmakers put pressure on themselves with tomorrow’s self-imposed deadline?, Mike Deehan: Yeah, a self-imposed deadline’s another way of saying fake deadline. It doesn’t really do anything.  Time is a pressure here, though, because what they’re really trying to do, the end goal, is to set up this Cannabis Control Commission. That is going to be the new regulatory body for the state that’s going to take in applications for marijuana shops, process them, vet the people who are trying to invest in these things, and get them online and issue those licenses. That’s what they’re up against, that’s the real deadline. So they have to kind of get this process moving as fast as they can so that we might actually have retail sales next year., Barbara Howard: So are you saying tomorrow’s deadline is a little squishy?, Mike Deehan: Oh yeah, well everything’s’ squishy around here, they can do whatever they want, but what isn’t squishy is getting those stores online and getting that timeframe in place to get those licenses going. The way I think both bills are written right now, they wouldn’t really be able to issue licenses before July 1st, 2018. That means that if we’re going to have stores open next summer, next fall, they gotta get in place where they can offer those licenses., Barbara Howard: What if they don’t? I mean, could this go on forever?, Mike Deehan: Well look what happened to medical marijuana. That was delayed plenty of times, a story would open here, another one over there. That didn’t get off the ground nearly as fast as was anticipated and a lot of it was because the regulations weren’t really in place and the administration at the time wasn’t really pushing to get it done. It wasn’t until the Baker administration came in that really got the doors open on a lot of those medical marijuana shops. This was going to be different, because it’s going to be a whole lot more people who are interested in this than the medical side of it. But, if they don’t go on sale at time, there’s no real repercussions other than angry consumers., Barbara Howard: Okay, thanks Mike., Mike Deehan: Thank you, Barbara., Barbara Howard: That’s WGBH State House reporter Mike Deehan., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

824,"[More Kids Are In DCF Care, But Are They Better Off?]","[In the two years since the body of two-year-old Bella Bond washed up on a Deer Island beach there’s been a significant uptick in the number of kids in state care. What’s not clear is whether vulnerable children are better off., “Since Bella Bond, we really haven’t had a child tragedy that’s been splashed across the headlines of the newspapers and that’s very important,” said Susan Elsen, an attorney with Massachusetts Law Reform Institute., Child welfare advocates say in the wake of highly-publicized child tragedies two things frequently happen: more people report suspected child abuse and agencies charged with protecting kids become more vigilant. , “There’s a pendulum that sort of swings periodically between what is called family support and stabilization, which is keeping kids at home,” said Maria Mossaides, the state’s child advocate, “and then periods from child welfare where the concern is on the safety side.”, Data from the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families show evidence of that pendulum swing. In 2013, the year Bella Bond was born, DCF managed about 46,500 cases. That number jumped to about 57,000 cases in 2015 and 2016. The number of kids in foster care is also up from about 7,600 in 2013 to more than 9,000 over the past two years., Elsen says that increase is further straining an already overburdened foster care system., “Young children are packing up every night not knowing where they’re going to sleeping the next night,” said Elsen. , She says foster homes intended for one night emergency stays — so-called hotline homes — are routinely being used to house children with nowhere else to go. The result is children, many of them toddler and preschool age, are moving from one location to next day after day.   , “Being bounced around from home to home is a form of neglect or abuse of a child,” said Elsen. “It’s not intentional, it’s not out of ill will, but it’s not good for kids.”, DCF data confirms that foster children are moving from one placement to another more frequently.  In 2013, 20 percent of foster children were placed in more than two homes within a year, compared to 30 percent in 2016., Elsen says many of the kids in foster care could instead stay at home if DCF provided families with more intensive support., “I don’t think DCF has all the tools because they don’t have enough social workers and they don’t have enough services,” said Elsen. “As a result I think more children are being pulled and placed in out-of-home placements.”, Mossaides, the state’s child advocate, agrees the foster care system is swamped. She points out that DCF is actively recruiting more foster families. The increased use of foster homes says Mossaides is not a response to the Bella Bond case, but the far-reaching impact of the opioid crisis., “Children are coming into care,” said Mossaides, “because there are not in safe situations in their home environments.”, Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

843,[Will Swampscott Pedal Ahead With A New Bike Trail Or Slam On The Breaks?],"[Massachusetts was once crisscrossed with railroad tracks that served as routes for freight and passengers. But many of those tracks have been dormant for generations, and more than 60 of them have been converted to bike paths. And while creating a bike trail might seem like one of the least controversial moves a town could make, a bike path is dividing one North Shore community., Standing on a traffic circle, with Swampscott Town Hall on one side and the rolling waves off Kings Beach on the other, about 15 people waved signs at passing traffic on a recent morning before work. The signs read: , “Vote ‘no’ on June 29. Stop the runaway taxes, the land grab, and the divisiveness.”, That divisiveness, Swampscott resident Paul Dwyer said, comes from a town plan to create a bike path., “Their proposal, the yes people, is a definite violation of human rights,” Dwyer said., That’s because Swampscott plans to seize land for the path using eminent domain. Swampscott resident Nancy Maloney says this has become a huge deal in town. “I’m like really frustrated that this is essentially pitting neighbor against neighbor,” she said., , That’s clear driving around Swampscott, where lawn after lawn is decorated with signs urging neighbors to vote YES or NO in a town referendum on the bike path next Thursday. Opponents also object to the expense of a rail trail. And they got enough signatures to force the town-wide vote — the first of its kind in town in about 40 years., Maura Carroll is one of the Swampscott residents urging voters to reject the bike path. She walked across the lawn behind her house and points to where decades ago, there were railroad tracks. Now, it’s all grass, up to a line of trees where the mid-point of the new path would be. “The back of my yard, from my patio to the ten-foot wide path, which is what they first discussed taking, was 10-foot wide, would be about 47 feet,” she said. , Back when trains were going by, the railroad had an easement to use the land. The utility National Grid later took over the easement to run the power lines that are now overhead here. Carroll doesn’t pay taxes on that property. National Grid does., , “But paying taxes does not equate to land ownership,” Carroll said., Carroll’s not alone. About 90 abutting landowners also could make a claim of ownership. The Swampscott Town Meeting had voted to study the ownership question moving forward, but Thursday’s referendum could put a stop to that. , Alexis Runstadler is leading the group that’s in favor of the path. “This process will identify whether or not those people own those properties,"" she said. ""As of now they don’t, as far as the town knows and as far as anybody else knows.”, , Runstadler's property also abuts the old railway, but the scene is totally different from Carroll’s yard. The bike trail would be hidden away, down a steep slope in the woods behind her house. ""You can see it’s a utility corridor and it’s basically a pathway already,” she said as she looked down at it., Runstadler used to live near a bike path in Fairbanks, Alaska, and said she loved it. “It will give us new open space,"" she added. ""It will give us a two-mile linear park through the entire town, linking the train station. It links three of our schools. It’s something that everyone can enjoy.”, The roughly two-mile trail would connect to an existing one in neighboring Marblehead., , “Lynnfield has a trail, Topsfield has a trail, other communities are working on trail,"" Runstadler said. ""This is a thing that people really want in their community.”, The town’s government wants it, too. Although Swampscott town administrator Sean Fitzgerald said using eminent domain to get it isn’t their first choice. The town, he added, would rather just work with the abutting landowners to take over the easement that National Grid has., “If someone did not want to negotiate with the town, it would really create a very difficult process,"" Fitzgerald said. ""I think with the authority to utilize eminent domain the town is able to move forward and accomplish what we’re setting out to do.”, And even if they do wind up taking the land, he says the town plans to work with the abutting landowners., “We want the abutters to know that they’re going to be the town’s neighbors,"" Fitzgerald said. ""And we want to make sure that along the rail trail, if we can design the trail in a way that makes sense for those neighborhoods, we will do that.”, Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

845,[“The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters”],"[The age of social media has made limitless information readily accessible to the masses. Via platforms such as Twitter, Wikipedia, and Google, laypeople are able not only to consume knowledge on any subject imaginable, but also to challenge professionals in those fields and fueled a disdain for legitimate credibility. Tom Nichols argues this point in his new book “The Death of Expertise: The Campaign Against Established Knowledge and Why It Matters.”, “It’s really the death of the idea of expertise, of relying on experts,” said Nichols when he joined Adam Reilly on “Greater Boston.” “There will always … be people who know how to do surgery or know how to negotiate a treaty or know how to defend you in a courtroom … what’s different now is that people reject the idea that those people know any more than anybody else.”, While the idea of refuting authority is hardly a new one, Nichols contends that the influence of the internet has exacerbated the frequency with which it occurs, especially now that the majority of the population carries “little answer boxes” at all times. Websites like Twitter sweeten the appeal by offering users the option to assume faceless online personas, lighting confrontational fires and then stoking them, with little chance of repercussion., “It’s not just that people think they’re learning everything they need to know from the internet,” said Nichols, “but the anonymity of social media makes people really mean and argumentative about it, and I think that that’s added to this problem in general.”, Additionally, people feel more emboldened in public settings to dispute the opinions of trained professionals. Nichols described a phenomenon that doctors call “paging Dr. Google,” whereby patients contest prognoses based on findings of their own internet research. Academic institutions, too, have seen the line between instructors and learners blurred, largely based on what Nichols refers to as a client-centric campus culture of keeping students content and unperturbed., “Increasingly, students are very comfortable lecturing their faculty,” explained Nichols, adding that questioning authority is indeed a healthy part of adolescent development. “But again, the phenomenon of the death of expertise is that the students are stepping forward and saying, ‘I actually know more about this than the teachers,’ on day one.”, Nichols, a professor of national security at the U.S. Naval War College and expert in Russian affairs, was compelled to write “The Death of Expertise” when the stories he would hear of other specialists being questioned and doubted began to feature in his own life and work., “It actually started during the [Edward] Snowden affair, when we were talking about … what I was arguing was Russia’s role, and people were saying to me, ‘Tom, let me explain Russia to you,’” said Nichols. “And, of course, now, it’s happening over again with the Russian influence on the election.”, The election in question saw Donald Trump assume the role of president of the United States after a campaign in which he had acted as an antithesis to traditional thinking and a champion of the poorly educated. The rhetoric used by Trump, a vocal Twitter presence himself, appears to have validated the practices of online argumentation and skepticism for a number of social media users., “There are culprits across the ideological spectrum, but unfortunately the president is the loudest voice in the room,” said Nichols. “The worst thing he did was to scapegoat experts because, I think, he’s finding … as every president does, you can’t run a government without experts.”, Another culprit, Nichols explained, is the myriad cable news channels whose programming is saturated with loud, animated disagreements. Despite the merits of offering such a varied array of viewpoints, viewers invariably become selective with the news they consume, and begin to take it as gospel., “People can now watch anything at any moment,” said Nichols. “There is more diversity in the sources of news, but it also means that people graze to find the things they actually want to hear … they cherry-pick the news, and every network can tailor that stream to a particular kind of demographic.”, To watch the full interview with Tom Nichols, click on the video link above.]"

849,"[Another Year, Thousands More Free State House Tours For The Doric Docents]","[Our setting for today's Curiosity Desk is one of my favorite rooms in the whole of the city of Boston: The Great Hall of the Massachusetts State House. , Joining me in this tri-colored marble room, beneath huge flags representing more than 300 Bay state towns are some 40 people, gathered to wrap up their 48th season and be lauded for a job well done., This is the annual meeting of the Doric Docents, an organization that for nearly half a century has offered free tours of the Massachusetts State House to countless students, residents, tourists and foreign dignitaries.  , ""The Docents are a wonderful group of adult volunteers who welcome visitors in a very special and unique way,"" said Director of State House Tours Mary Rinehart, who supervises the program. ""Many of these Docents have been with us for 20 or more years, so they’re very devoted and loyal."", , The group was started as the Doric Dames in 1969 by Jessie Sargent, wife of then-governor Francis Sargent. They were renamed the Doric Docents in 1999, when they first let men join the program. Today, as at the start, the honorary president is the governor’s wife., ""I like to say that it’s my greatest unearned honor to be the President of the Doric Docents,"" said Massachusetts’ current first lady, Lauren Baker, who was on hand for the annual meeting. ""I couldn’t begin to hold a candle to the knowledge and skill that the Docents bring to their jobs every day."", So, just who are these Doric Docents? , Most of them are retirees. They come from all over the state: Boston, Reading, Andover. They are former book store employees, Harvard administrators and high school principles. What do they have in common? A love of the Commonwealth, its history and an urge to share., ""Remember the Latin root for the word docent: 'doce docere', to teach,"" said 15-year Docent Joe Ponti. ""And you really are a teacher."", And what teacher could ask for a better classroom? A building echoing with centuries of history; art work ranging from stately portraits to sculptures of American titans to relics of the American Revolution. Not to mention the building itself: Charles Bulfinch’s masterpiece of Federal architecture. , And yet, for all that grandeur, the Docents tell me that – more often than not – the star of their tours? Democracy in action., ""It’s a living museum,"" said Ponti. ""They love the Senate chamber."", ""When you go to the House and Senate, people are really interested in the procedures,"" added Dorothy Sullivan, a longtime Docent. , This small band of volunteers not only manages the day-to-day of the program – they also keep the ranks filled with new recruits, which is not as easy as it might seem., , ""Actually, it’s quite rigorous,"" explained Ellen Carpenter, who's been a Docent for three years. She says there’s plenty to be learned in order to become a Doric Docent, but the real challenge is the final one before certification – designing your own tour for an audience of one: the boss, Mary Rinehart., ""You have to go around and give her a tour,"" began Carpenter, then hesitated., ""Is that a nerve-wracking moment?"" I asked., ""Yes it was, actually, it was. It was nerve-wracking,"" she replied., And what does Mary Rinehart think of that?, , ""Well, as I tell them, I don't bite,"" said Rinehart, laughing. ""But we do have a responsibility to be accurate with our facts and make sure that they have all the necessary information."", Rinehart says that “design your own"" aspect ensures that no two State House tours are exactly the same – the unique trademark of the Doric Docents., ""They have their own sense of history, their own areas of specialty and interest,"" she said of the Docents. ""They, of course, have had lots of life experience so they can interact with people about historical events that they personally have witnessed. They all bring those different interests and specialties to the tour in addition to the basic facts."", About 100,000 people visit the State House each year. And that this stable of volunteers stands ready to personally welcome them is something that Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, who stopped by to offer his thanks, says is remarkable., ""This has been our capital now for over 200 years and it’s really the centerpiece of our government,"" he said. ""And giving people not just the opportunity to view it but also to explain the history of so much of it is very important. I don’t think we’d have the appreciation of our capital that we have without them and their activities over all these years., And that they are average citizens offering their time and expertise to share a part of Massachusetts’ story with the young and old, free of charge? Well, what could be more democratic?, Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"

The Boston Crusaders was founded over 77 years ago in Hyde Park, and the band now attracts young people from all over the world. The crusaders are currently on the road, but recently made a stop in Groton., Among this year’s group is 17-year-old Amber Padgett of Dorchester. This is her second year as a dancer with the traveling drum and bugle corps., “I love the family setting. You can go up to anyone and know that you can have a conversation with them,"" she said. ""I’ve met people from around the United States, some people from Taiwan, Japan, Canada.”, Executive director Chris Holland runs the summer program that includes 100 performers. They include drummers, horn players and dancers, mostly teenagers and all under 21. Holland says traveling is part of the experience., “We travel the country, do over 13,000 miles and over 30 performance shows,"" he said.  , They perform in places like Chicago, Texas and California and have even graced the stage with the Boston Pops — not bad for a band that started 77 years ago out of offices in Hyde Park., The Boston Crusaders have grown to attract some of the best young, international performers. About 750 people from around the world audition and the group leaders pick the best. Local performers like Katie Tingley from Orleans are especially welcome. This is her first year with the group. , “I just thought I’d audition here and I made a spot and I got to play Murrumba, and I am super excited,"" she said., The fee to join the group for the three-month tour is $3,000, which can create a hardship for some performers, so over 40 percent of them receive some type of financial aid and assistance. Those scholarships and donations cover the cost of travel, housing and food which ends up costing about $8,000 per band member. Many, like Amber Padgett and Katie Tingley, wouldn’t be part of the group without the help. , “I think it’s really important that they help the students because for me, learning is so much and so important,"" said Padgett., “I got a discount just for being from Massachusetts, so that was great,"" Tingley added, ""and a lot of people don’t have the means to do this experience, but it’s an experience worth having."", Aside from the travel and performances, students take educational trips. Chris Holland also has a non-profit called Inspire Arts that brings music and arts to neighborhoods like Dorchester, where members of the Boston Crusaders and other groups teach and perform with the participants. That’s just another way the hometown super group stays grounded., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"

858,[Quelling Chronic Pain Without Prescription Drugs],"[Hospital visits due to prescription pain killers are on the rise — more than doubling from 2005 to now, according to new government data — which shows 1.27 million people went to the ER or were hospitalized because of opioids in 2014 and Massachusetts has among the highest rates in the nation. For people who suffer from chronic pain, relief is hard to find. But a Waltham company is trying to offer a glimmer of hope with an over-the-counter device — no pills required., Tom Shea was 20 years-old when he got into a car accident in Worcester that left him with a severe back injury, and began a decades-long battle with prescription drug use., “I went through the whole gamut of them through my doctor, whether it be Tramadol, Vicodin, Percocet, all the way up to the Oxycontin,"" Shea said. ""When your body gets used to them, that’s the addicted part because you don’t really realize that at first, but it gets to the point where it wears you down and becomes the only thing that you think about.”, When three back surgeries over the course of nine months didn’t mitigate the pain, the meds were the only thing that allowed him to be active with his family., “When you ran out of them, it basically became hell on earth,"" he said. ""I don’t know that people really understand the side effects or withdrawal symptoms, but it changes your mind. It changes your body.”, Fed up, the father of four quit his meds two years ago, accepting a life of chronic pain that was, at times, debilitating. But three months ago, things took a dramatic turn when he started wearing a neurostimulating device on his leg, called Quell., “There are some times when I feel like I don’t have an injury. To have times when I actually feel normal, is huge to me,” Shea said., So how does a device that you wear on your upper calf relieve pain elsewhere? At the Neurometrix factory in Woburn, CEO Shai Gozani explains how Quell works., “It stimulates the nerves of the upper calf,"" Gozani said. ""There's nothing magical about the upper calf other than that it's a place with a lot of nerves.”, With electrodes and hydrogel pads, Quell sends high-frequency electrical pulses to those nerves. This signals the brain to release its own painkillers — called endogenous opioids. They essentially channel our brain’s own morphine., “They safely decreases your perception of pain,” said Gozani. “And regardless of where the location of the pain is, it's a systemic and widespread effect.”, Quell sends pulses for an hour, and then stops for an hour so the nervous system can reset. All the while, a smartphone app keeps track of the data via bluetooth. But the app is optional and not required to operate the device., Electrical nerve stimulation therapy has been widely used since the 1970s, most commonly in the form of TENS devices. More recently, electrotherapy has been taking off, as other devices and procedures using similar technology continue to make their way into the market., Not everyone is as quick to jump on board with the nerve-based treatment, though. Winchester resident Paula Gaines has been dealing with multiple sclerosis for the last 17 years., “My legs, generally, is where I feel my pain. It comes and goes and it's not constant,"" Gaines said. ""One day I'll have ice bucket feet and the next day they'll be on fire. I just had to live with it."", At first, she was skeptical about Quell., “I didn't know if it was the device, if it was the disease or if it was placebo effect,” she said. “It's hard to buy into something when you've gone that long feeling pain that people either can't diagnose or they can't, you know, tell you how to treat it or give you anything that works.”, These days, Gaines no longer needs a cane, and she’d like to keep it that way. The same goes for Tom Shea, who’s now clocking in 10,000 steps a day., The big caveat? Nerve stimulation therapy does not work for everyone. Shai Gozani says Quell works in about 80 percent of users, and effectiveness can vary depending on the person., “The one category of pain it’s not particularly effective in, is headache and migraines but other common forms, like back pain and nerve pain and fibromyalgia and arthritic pain — those are all quite effective in those types.” Gozani said., As for those endogenous opioids, there’s a lot of research looking into using our brain’s own painkillers in how we study and treat other conditions, like depression, anxiety and sleep disorders. It’s too early to say where this will take us but it’s possible that whatever ails you next might not be treated with a pill., Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

862,"[On World Refugee Day, Photos Of Displaced Syrians Are On Display At Boston City Hall]","[To mark the occasion of World Refugee Day, Boston City Hall is hosting a reception that features an exhibit called ""The Faces of Syrian Refugees."" The exhibit has photographs of 20 Syrian refugees displaced by their country's civil war. The project is the work of Lasell College professor Dana Janbek, freelance journalist Amy Bracken, and photographer Michael Cohen. Cohen, a Boston native, discussed the exhibit with WGBH's Henry Santoro., HENRY SANTORO: You came up with the concept for this project in early 2016. What was the light bulb moment?, MICHAEL COHEN: Well, it was interesting. I had been driven crazy by the Syrian refugee crisis for the last several years, and finally, I saw a documentary film that was shot in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. And it occurred to me that all of the images that we had been seeing about Syrian refugees, we're seeing them at their worst — in the camps, trying to escape, and all of those terrible images that we all know. And I thought maybe we should see some Syrian refugees at their best., SANTORO: What are some of the places that you traveled to find these people?, COHEN: So we worked first with UNHCR, the United Nations High Commission on Refugees, to find and identify Syrian refugees who had left because of the war and had resettled in other countries, primarily through Europe, and in Germany is where we first began. And our goal was to find refugees who had been in their new homes for at least a year, so they were now integrated as part of their new communities, and we were able to see how they had been surviving, and then thriving., , SANTORO: Could you tell as you were taking their photos that you were helping them to humanize the crisis that they had been through?, COHEN: When we first contacted them, they understood immediately what we were trying to do, and they were so welcoming. And what was really interesting was we were only looking for 20 Syrians, and we only had to find 20 Syrians, because everybody we talked to said ""yes, I know what you’re trying to do and I really want to help."", SANTORO: But I bet finding 20 Syrians was not the easiest job on the planet., COHEN: No, not at all, and we had a lot of help from a lot of NGOs in Germany, Canada and the United States, because once the Syrian refugees come out of the system at the very beginning, once they get settled, they sort of lose track. And so we had to sort of get in the network to find them., SANTORO: Photographers often have to gain the trust of their subjects. Was that the case with this project?, COHEN: Oh absolutely, but we had a little bit of help, because on our team we have a journalist, and we have a researcher, and our researcher is Jordanian-born. She’s actually from here in Boston; she is a professor at Lasell College, her name is Dana Janbek, and she’s a fluent Arabic speaker. So we did the primary contact in Arabic, and so having the language was really helpful, gaining trust and gaining credibility., , SANTORO: Did you ask them to share their stories of what they had to do both physically and emotionally to leave their homeland behind?, COHEN: You know it’s interesting, I think we had a bit of conversation about what it took to get them out of Syria, but the primary goal, in order to humanize them and create connection with American audiences, was to learn about them as people. We wanted to know what their favorite TV shows are, we wanted to know what their favorite food is from their childhood, what some of their memories are of their grandparents, what brings them joy, what keeps them up at night. The kind of questions that we ask each other., SANTORO: Describe the looks on some of their faces as you were photographing them., COHEN: A lot of them were being photographed for the first time, so there was the standard nervousness, and to be honest with you, we made it a little bit difficult for them because when we did the photographs, they were primarily over the winter, and I didn’t want any of the images to look like they had been shot in winter, so we set up settings that didn’t look like winter. But we were outside, and it was about 30 degrees, so they were bundled up in coats and scarves until just before we took the pictures., , SANTORO: These pictures that are on view at Boston City Hall are not just small pictures that are hanging on the wall. These are, in some cases, larger than life., COHEN: Well, we wanted to create some impact, and the impact is in both the number of images and the size of the images, and what you’ll find is that each refugee has two photographs: one that is full head-to-toe, and it’s printed six feet tall so it’s life-size, and then right next to it, also six feet tall, is a facial portrait, so, with eyes about …, SANTORO: Eyes the size of soccer balls., COHEN: Yeah, and you know, you’re right there with them and you really feel like you’re there., , SANTORO: So let me ask you this: there is, of course, a political component to all of this, with President Trump’s travel ban that would restrict Syrians from coming into the United States that is working its way through the court system. And Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has been an outspoken critic of President Trump. Does any of this play a role in this exhibit being shown inside City Hall?, COHEN: There have been polls across the country that show that the majority of Americans don’t want Syrian refugees here. Our goal was to help educate people so that they can form an educated opinion. By seeing Syrian refugees at their best, and having an understanding how they can contribute to their communities, we’re teaching Americans something that perhaps they don’t already know., SANTORO: Now, this exhibit is up through the end of the month, through June 30. How proud are you to have its premiere in the city that you live in?, COHEN: Well, we have had opportunities to have the exhibit in various other parts of the country where it will travel after Boston.

Both Crouse and Hall joined Boston Public Radio discuss the play, following its New England Premiere this past weekend. , When asked to give a brief summation of the play in the context of today's modern world, Hall had this to say: “How much is [life] about personal relationships and how much is it about what a relationship is doing chemically and emotionally to you?” Hall said., Hall further described that as an actor, for a play such as this, it is of utmost importance that the characters they play resemble real people., “We’ve tried to connect it to the characters we’re playing and their relationship. A lot of it has to do with people that care about each other how do they take care of each other?..Is there a chemical way to be taken care of? I think the play has to be about actual people so that's what we’ve been trying to figure out,” Hall said., Crouse notes that the play asks some of the questions we ask ourselves in our everyday lives, such as are we doing what we're supposed to? And how can we change that, if we’re not?, “We are a culture and society that has moved toward looking for happiness in external things. The drugs could be considered an external thing. And who are you if you're not the successful one? If your life is not working out the way it should on TV? The way this jangled and jacked up culture is racing to the finish line and you're not coming in first second or third. what kind of examination do you make of your life and do you need something to change that?” Crouse said., For Hall, this marks his own return to the stage after a lengthy career in film and television. , “I grew up doing plays and I have always thought of plays as the most fun thing and then when one doesn't do plays for a while you sort of think what would be a good way to get back at doing that that's honest and actually about the work? So this turned out to be the perfect way to do it,” Hall said., “The Effect” will be at the Gloucester Stage Company through July 10th.

869,[Michelle Carter Found Guilty],"[A Massachusetts woman was found guilty today of involuntary manslaughter for urging an 18-year old friend to commit suicide., Judge Lawrence Moniz said the text messages Michelle Carter sent to a suicidal Conrad Roy, urging him to kill himself, constituted wanton and reckless conduct. But he said prosecutors did not prove those messages caused his death.  He did, however, say she was responsible, because of how she reacted when Roy got out of a truck that was filling with carbon monoxide., “When Ms. Carter realizes that Mr. Roy has exited the truck, she instructs him to get back into the truck,"" Moniz said., Judge Moniz compared this to the 2013 case involving the Worcester Cold Storage Warehouse fire, in which two homeless people didn’t report a fire they’d accidentally started, resulting in the death of six firefighters. The court ruled in that case that the defendants failed to exercise reasonable care to prevent the risk., “The reckless failure to fulfill this duty can result in a charge of manslaughter,"" he said."", The judge described Carter listening on the phone as Roy died, and he said she didn’t call anyone for help., “Consequently, this court has found that the Commonwealth has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Carter’s actions and also her failure to act, where she had a self-created duty to Mr. Roy, since she had put him into that toxic environment, constituted each and all, wanton and reckless conduct,"" he said., The judge didn’t buy the defense’s claim that Carter’s actions were impacted by intoxication from psychiatric medication.  After the verdict, Roy’s father, also named Conrad Roy, made a brief statement, in which he called his son by his nickname, Coco., “This has been a very tough time for our family, and we’d like to just process this verdict, that we’re happy with,"" Roy said., Assistant District Attorney Katie Rayburn said although the DA’s office was pleased with the verdict, there were no winners in the case.,  “Two families have been torn apart and will be affected by this for years to come,"" she said. ""With that being said, we fervently hope today’s guilty verdict will bring some measure of justice to the friends and family of Conrad Roy, and provide them with some opportunity for closure.”, Defense attorneys told reporters they were disappointed by the ruling, but did not elaborate about plans for an appeal. The American Civil Liberties Union denounced the conviction, saying it exceeds the limits of the state’s criminal laws and violates free speech protections., Carter was released on bail until sentencing on August third, and faces up to 20 years in prison. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

Marijuana Law, 'Hell on Earth,' Squeezing the Customers]","[It’s looking more and more likely that Massachusetts’ recreational marijuana law could be a lot different than the one we, 1.8 million of us, approved in November. A very different marijuana bill came out of committee yesterday, which included an increase in the tax rate of marijuana from 12 percent, which voters approved last year, to 28 percent. The proposal would also grant local city councils and boards of selectmen the authority to limit or ban retail stores. In the original version, that power went exclusively to the voters. House Speaker Robert DeLeo told reporters they were postponing a vote on the proposal, originally scheduled for Thursday, but hope to have a bill on the governor’s desk by the end of the month. Jim Borghesani, spokesman for Yes on 4, the group that sponsored the original ballot question, and Representative Aaron Vega, a Holyoke Democrat, who serves on the Marijuana Policy Committee, joined Jim Braude for more on what’s next., Over the past few weeks, the US-led coalition in Syria has been increasing air strikes, particularly in and around Raqqa. While the goal is to re-take the area from ISIS, United Nations officials estimate the bombings have killed 300 civilians since March and forced about 160,000 more to flee. It's just the latest battle waging in the five-year war in Syria. The turmoil there is the subject of a new documentary on National Geographic called “Hell on Earth: The Fall of Syria and the Rise of ISIS.” Academy Award-nominated filmmaker and bestselling author, and one of the two men behind this documentary, Sebastian Junger, joined Jim to discuss the film., Jim’s thoughts on restaurants increasingly putting the squeeze on customers – literally., Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"
875,"[Filmmaker Sebastian Junger Describes ""Hell on Earth"" In Syria]","[“Eventually, if you kill civilians enough, they will arm themselves and fight back,” said Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Sebastian Junger, when he joined Jim Braude on “Greater Boston” to talk about his new documentary, “Hell on Earth: The Fall of Syria and the Rise of ISIS.” The film explores how what began as peaceful demonstrations by Syrian citizens escalated into the destructive civil war that now engulfs the nation. It chronicles the stories of participants and the personal struggles of those now caught in the middle., A longtime journalist well-versed in war, Junger, alongside filmmaking partner Nick Quested, intended to explore exactly what led to the extreme violence that has devoured much of Syria, and how the group that calls itself the Islamic State, or ISIS, emerged as a global threat., “The longer civil wars go on, the more they favor radical elements,” said Junger. “ISIS is this international pariah, renowned for their bloodthirsty behavior, and we wanted to explain that they’re a logical outcome from the circumstances.”, A U.S.-led coalition has orchestrated strikes in the Syrian city of Raqqa in recent weeks and heavily damaged ISIS strongholds. ISIS, however, is an ally to neither Syrian President Bashar al-Assad nor the civilians being persecuted under his rule., “This is the irony — [Assad] wants ISIS there,” explained Junger. “The biggest threat to Assad, actually, were the moderate factions in the beginning that were wanting real democracy … he knew that they would be appealing to Western powers.”, Those Western powers, specifically the United States, were largely unresponsive during the Syrian civil war’s inception. Citing the divisive momentum that had been brewing in several Arab countries, Junger believes that war would have begun with or without initial intervention., “It’s not our fault that it started, but there was a time when we might have been able to stop it,” posited Junger. “I’m not sure the airstrikes [then-President Barack Obama] had in mind were designed to stop the war so much as to be punitive as a reaction to the use of chemical weapons.”, A more recent chemical attack perpetrated by Assad did draw a response from the United States, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, who greenlit a plan to launch fifty-nine tomahawk missiles were at aircraft and infrastructure targets in Syria. Junger acknowledged that, while the strike may have done little to deter the warring factions, it was nonetheless significant., “It does nothing, except that there is some value in symbolism,” said Junger. “The problem with doing nothing, which is what Obama did … is, basically, he communicated [that] you can do something outrageous and we’re not going to act.”, Junger foresees no peaceful resolution to the struggle, and predicts that Assad will remain in power, even with the number of ISIS insurgents diminishing., “[Assad] is not going anywhere; he’s got Iran behind him, he’s got Russia behind him, he’s not going to be toppled,” said Junger. “The end of the war … might come through a kind of partitioning of the country, which in some ways seems too bad … if it ends the bloodshed, that’s the right thing to do.”, A great deal of the bloodshed has been inflicted on innocent Syrian civilians, which is why Junger and Quested chose to focus the picture through a human lens. A National Geographic Documentary Film, “Hell on Earth” showcases explicit scenes of daily torment for the Syrian people, pared down from hundreds of hours of captured footage. Families are shown hiding in darkness amid gunfire and explosions and, in some cases, taking the uniquely dangerous risk of fleeing the country., “They’re just good, ordinary people,” said Junger. “That’s the vast majority of civilians in any civil war.”, Their leaps of faith in the face of such horror have fortified the filmmaker’s belief in the ability of the human spirit to prevail., “Humans are adaptive; we are wired to overcome trauma,” said Junger. “If that weren’t true, the human race wouldn’t exist. We wouldn’t have survived.”, To watch Sebastian Junger's full interview, click on the video link above.]"

How do you respond to that?, WALSH: Yeah, I mean I mean it did work today I guess to some degree. Five people still got shot and I don't know all the circumstances behind this gentleman. Was it a legally owned gun? How did he have access to a gun? But to bring it back to the city of Boston and the kids in our neighborhoods and the kids in our street that have access to guns, they have too much access to guns ... I think that in an urban area, particularly in our city, what I want to do is continue to take guns off the street., On London Mayor Sadiq Kahn’s ongoing feud with President Donald Trump and Walsh’s feelings about the president, BRAUDE: Sadiq Kahn has said he does not want Donald Trump to get a state visit to Great Britain. He says, ""his policies go against everything we stand for."" Is he making the right move?, WALSH: I mean I think he is. Trump was very critical of him right after the incident happened, so I think that the mayor is probably frustrated that the first Muslim mayor of London ... understanding what Trump's comments have been over Muslims, indirectly, since he's been a candidate — and he hasn't really made any crazy statements since he's been president about Muslims, other than … trying to put a ban in place — so I think he has his right to speak his mind, his opinion. I think the people of England are really upset with Donald Trump. He basically has taken them on in little different ways and I felt that after the incident happened in London, Trump tweeted something and I felt that that was something that the President of the United States of America should have addressed to the people of the world., BRAUDE: So he has spoken ill of you as well and I think you could say —, WALSH: Well not since then., BRAUDE: Well yeah but you would say the same words: his policies go against everything we stand for., WALSH: They do., BRAUDE: Would you want him here?, WALSH: They do. They do go against everything we stand for., BRAUDE: So would you want him in Boston?, WALSH: I mean if he wants to come to Boston, he can come to Boston and let people in Boston let them know how they feel about his policies…. He's the President of the United States of America. Nobody has a right, no mayor has a right not to allow or to accept the president coming to town., BRAUDE: I know you're not a lawyer, but I'm sure you've been following all these Comey, Sessions hearings as best you can, considering your day job. Do you think the President of the United States has obstructed justice Mr. Mayor?, WALSH: It’s hard to say, you know. It's just it's an awful, awful embarrassment for the United States of America watching this this soap opera unfold every single night … where Sessions gets in … and contradicts what Comey said and Comey’s accusing the president of being a liar. It's just a sad situation and I would hope that the president did not obstruct justice here., BRAUDE: But in our gut, do you think he did? I mean you're a citizen, too, in addition to being mayor., WALSH: I don't want to prejudge anything. I want to let this thing play out before I say anything…. I would hope that the president wouldn't do that … but it seems like there's a lot more to the story that's going to come out., On the racially insensitive video under investigation, which appears to feature a police officer and includes the tagline, “this summer, black people have met their match” , WALSH: I was angry about it when I first heard it…. it's under investigation. Today I spoke to Commissioner Evans. It’s still under investigation. This was Friday, now it's Wednesday, so we're still trying to get to the bottom of it. Certainly, a police officer concerns me — that a police officer potentially would do something like this videotape or be part of videotape., BRAUDE: If it is what it appears, should he be fired?, WALSH: It's a potential. It’s either a potential termination or a long-term suspension. And, again, I don't know the particulars yet, but certainly anything to do with race is not something we can tolerate…. It's being taken very, very seriously and … even if it was during off-hours, a police officer is a sworn officer of the law and, whether they're on duty or off duty, they're still on duty as far as I’m concerned., On the controversy over comments Walsh made on Boston Public Radio about pedestrians and cyclists sharing responsibility for road safety, On May 16, Walsh said, “Pedestrians need to put their head up when they're walking down the street. Take your headphones off. Cross in the crosswalk. Follow the lights. You can't be running across the middle of the street. You've got to understand cars are going to hit you.”, BRAUDE: The head of the Boston Cyclists Union said, “Boston's clueless mayor blames bicyclists, pedestrians for lethal crashes.” There were others who said similar things. What do you say to this guy and people like him?, WALSH: That response was not appropriate. If you listen to the whole show, a little later in that clip, I talk about cars paying attention as well … and that was not in response to the cyclists dying. It was in response to just people on the roads, whether it was injured by auto accidents or people crossing the street or bikes hitting people … we were talking about how do we co-exist on the roads … and as we move further into the 21st century, transportation modes are changing. We’re going to have more people taking bicycles, more pedestrians walking, more people running and we have more cars on the street because we have more jobs and more people living in the city of Boston, so we have to co-exist on the roads and we have to be careful of one another., On the “millionaire’s tax” debate in Massachusetts, WALSH: What I want to make sure is that, as we talk about where the revenue from this tax is going, I want to have a say in where this money is going. When I think about the city budget, 70% of our budget is based off real estate taxes….  I have a proposal in front of the legislature now, which is a good proposal, to pay for universal pre-kindergarten schools. I want to make sure how this money comes to the city of Boston —, BRAUDE: So you need the legislature to make a prior commitment to you before you support the question?, WALSH: I need some help on how this money will be spent in the city of Boston., BRAUDE: But until that point you won’t endorse the question?,  WALSH: Well I'm going to have conversations about it, because I'm concerned about making sure the revenue hits the streets of Boston., BRAUDE: What if they don't make a promise? What if the legislative leaders say I'm not going promise you in advance –, WALSH: We'll see what happens., On Governor Charlie Baker’s handing of state finance issues, BRAUDE: …the state bond rating [was] downgraded for the first time in a quarter of a century. The governor said it was a wakeup call. Jay Gonzalez, Democrat running for governor, said, “Governor Baker is failing us.” Do you agree with Gonzales?, WALSH: I wouldn’t say failing, but I think there's certainly some structural issues with the state budget. I mean I see it in my own budget in the city as far as the money that we're not getting to the city of Boston, the fact that the House and the Senate has negotiated two different budgets and now they're doing a conference committee where they have to cut $500 million or so out of the budget. There's a structural issue there that they have to figure out., On the leadership change at General Electric, BRAUDE: When you said the other day that you were taken by surprise when you heard that Jeff Immelt, almost a nanosecond after they got here, is leaving the leadership of GE — When someone like you makes a comment like that, it seems to me that underneath the comment, you're a little aggravated that you were not given a heads up. Are you? Are you worried at all?, WALSH: I wouldn't say aggravated. Now that a couple of days have gone by and the dust has settled, the new person that's going in has a health care background and you can clearly see maybe some of them moving GE to Boston was really about health care and this person … [John Flannery] ran the health care division of General Electric, so you can start to see maybe a little direction of where the company is going to go in the future., This transcript has been edited for clarity and brevity.

So we ask you to cooperate. Don’t bring backpacks, don’t bring coolers, don’t bring things that are going to slow down the process of you moving into a particular area.”, City police will be joined by specially trained state troopers in plain clothes, who will mix with the crowd looking for suspicious activity, and 100 FBI agents will be on hand., Hank Shaw, Special Agent in charge of the Boston FBI office said his team made efforts to ""harden"" so-called ""soft targets"" like the designated areas where spectators will view the ships — making them more difficult to attack., ""The reality of the world we're dealing with today is that we do the best we can to harden as much as possible, to be able to allow the public to have really a safe viewing experience,"" he said. ""But the reality behind what we're confronted with is that any potential area could be vulnerable."" , , Mayor Marty Walsh says the plan makes him feel Boston is safe., “Now that doesn’t mean that something can’t happen,"" Walsh said. ""All it means is that we have no threats today. What I would ask the public to do, is if you see something, just call. Just grab somebody, there’s going to be plenty of public safety officials there. Or call 911. We will pursue every single lead or every single concern that people might have.”, The event has been given a special federal security designation typically reserved for national spectacles, like the Super Bowl, because of its size and complexity, not because of any specific threat., At a press conference on Sail Boston security, Gov. Charlie Baker reacted to the shooting Wednesday morning in Alexandria, Va. that injured Rep. Steve Scalise and four others. Walsh said the annual baseball game between Democrats and Republicans that they were practicing for is something that brings both sides together. And he said there’s no excuse — regardless of the heated partisan political dialogue — for what happened., “Congressman Scalise, by all accounts, is a partisan, but he’s also someone who everybody on both sides of the aisle likes as a person,"" Walsh said. ""And the Capitol police who were involved in this, including the ones who were wounded, did heroic duty today to make sure it wasn’t worse than it might have been. And certainly, I think, the most important lesson in all of this, is that continued vigilance matters.”, Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

886,"[Same Facts, Different Stories In Carter Text-Suicide Closings]","[The trial of Michelle Carter, accused of encouraging Roy Conrad to commit suicide via text messages when the two were both teenagers, is over. , In their closing arguments today, attorneys for the two sides presented starkly different versions of what are largely uncontested facts. , Conrad Roy had suffered for years from depression and indeed had attempted to take his life before., Michelle Carter had at various points in her relationship with Roy been supportive of his struggles and had urged him to seek help., And yet, in the days preceding Roy’s suicide, Carter had repeatedly sent text messages not only encouraging him to commit suicide but mocking him for failing to do so., And she was on the phone with him the night of his suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning in his truck, seemingly while the act was underway, later telling a friend that when Roy got out of his truck, apparently balking, she told him to get back in., Prosecutor Katie Rayburn focused intently on this moment, painting a picture not only of Carter’s cruelty and disregard for Roy’s life, but as the intentional outcome of a plan of monstrous selfishness Carter had hatched., Carter, whom prosecutors depicted as insecure and in desperate need of the affirmation of her friends, had told some friends that Roy had gone missing a few days before and that she feared he had already committed suicide – a fiction she continued to perpetuate even while she was in communication with Roy., Carter’s simple goal: attention. Carter, Rayburn said, wanted to bask in the pity and attention she would receive playing the part of the “grieving girlfriend.”, Afraid of being found out as a liar for saying Roy was missing, Carter pushed Roy to ultimately go through with a suicide he may have contemplated, but was in fact reluctant or unwilling to enact but for Carter’s influence., “Unfortunately, despite her best efforts, he’s still alive,” Rayburn said in her closing arguments. “People are starting to ask questions.”, “So the defendant is stuck. And you can see in the text messages throughout the day that at this point she is more than urging, she’s telling Conrad, ‘It’s gotta happen.’ … ‘You can’t wait any longer.’”, “At that point your honor, Conrad Roy becomes essentially disposable to the defendant.”, But Carter’s defense team argued that Roy’s actions were ultimately his own responsibility., Carter’s suicidal thoughts and plans were long-standing. Roy had researched suicide on the internet, corresponded with at least one other individual about suicide online and obtained the water hose he would use to pump carbon monoxide into his truck., Joseph Cataldo, Carter’s attorney, also addressed the infamous night of the suicide, arguing that the story prosecutors have told is speculative., While Carter told a friend that Roy was frightened and that she had ordered Roy back into the truck, Carter might have been lying – a tendency of hers the prosecution itself had highlighted., And even if Roy did leave the truck, it was ultimately Conrad Roy and only Conrad Roy who could have made that decisions – and who could know why he did it., “Conrad apparently knew [the hose] was working, and yet chose to get back in, but because he was ‘scared’ or ‘afraid,’ [prosecutors] want to basically replace that word that somehow therefore, after that, by going back in the car, that wasn’t his own decisions that he didn’t have the free, voluntary ability to say,” Cataldo said., “He chose, he chose, your honor.”, “Did the Commonwealth prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he would have been alive,” without his communications with Carter, Cataldo said, “I suggest is lacking.”, Carter has waived the right to a jury. Judge Lawrence Moniz will decide the case, likely in coming days.,  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

Allegiant Air announced last week they’ll begin direct flights from Providence. Travel journalist Bob Weiss says this is the latest in a series of airlines choosing to fly out of T.F. Green., “I think more importantly, they’re making this a hub for discount carriers,"" Weiss said. ""I think once people realize that, they’re going to take another look at Providence. I think Logan is going to continue to grow, but I think Providence is going to grow faster."", Green cites its location as easy and convenient. Almost two-thirds of New England’s population lives within a 75-mile radius of the Green airport, according to the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC)., “There’s lower parking rates than Logan Airport. But more importantly, there’s Peter Pan bus lines and MBTA purple lines right into the airport,"" Weiss said. ""So the travelers taking these flights not only are going to get a good deal money wise, but also convenience."", Last month, Frontier Airlines chose Providence as its New England hub where it will begin its non-stop flight services from Rhode Island to Colorado and Florida this August., The RIAC announced in February that Norwegian Airlines will begin its flight service to Ireland this summer. And a few weeks ago, RIAC revealed that Norwegian will offer cheap, direct flights to Guadalupe and Martinique starting this October. This means that Norwegian is transferring its winter flights to the Caribbean from Logan to Providence, Weiss said., Even so, Weiss says Logan Airport is still going to be the “mecca” for international carriers. However, Green’s new discount carriers may challenge Massport’s efforts in attracting airlines to Worcester Airport., Overall, Green’s addition of these three major discounted airlines is “bigger than Providence,"" Weiss said. “This is an important development for New England aviation.”]"

905,[Michelle Carter May Have Encouraged Suicide; But Is She A Criminal?],"[Often, a criminal trial is a contest over a competing set of facts., But the case of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts versus Michelle Carter, charged with involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy for allegedly encouraging him to commit suicide, does not quite fit that mold., For one thing, most of the facts of Conrad’s suicide have not been disputed – and the case may ultimately hinge on Carter’s intentions, motivations, and the perplexing nature of the relationship between Michelle Carter and Conrad Roy – a relationship that does not appear, after two days of testimony, to match the easy “Girlfriend/Boyfriend” characterization that media accounts have proliferated., But Carter’s defense also hopes to turn the prosecution’s narrative on its head., Carter’s lawyers will try to show that Roy’s own mental health struggles were deep-seated and that Roy had contemplated and even researched suicide long before he even met Michelle., And they will likely offer evidence that rather than a heartless exploiter of Roy’s troubles, Carter was a fellow sufferer: a teenager who had struggled herself with mental health issues, who had sought to help and support Roy while seeking medical help for her own problems, and who may have been experiencing adverse reactions to psychotropic medications when she sent the infamous text messages., The case has been widely characterized as putting on trial the legal limits of digital bullying – and it may turn out to be just that., But it may yet turn out to revolve around hazier issues, including the tricky lines between the agency, culpability, and moral responsibility of young people as they try to navigate confusing, difficult and sometimes disappointing paths towards health., To Recap: Carter, who lived in Plainville, and Roy, who lived in Mattapoisett, happened to meet while both were in Florida. Carter was 17 and Roy was 18., They struck up a relationship that was mostly or almost entirely conducted by phone and text message.  , They would talk about Roy’s struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. When Roy’s thoughts turned again to suicide in the summer of 2014, Michelle Carter sent him various text messages seemingly encouraging him, like:  , ·       “When you going to do it? Stop avoiding the question”, ·       “You better not be bullshitting me when you say [you’re] going to do that.”, ·       “You need to do it … you promise?”, When, on July 13, 2014, Roy got into his truck and began to pump carbon monoxide into the vehicle, Carter was apparently on the phone with him, encouraging him to go through with it – and even telling him to get back into the truck when Roy, apparently having second thoughts, confided over the phone that he’d gotten out of it., Carter apparently stayed on the phone with Roy when he did get back into his truck until he was no longer responsive., Roy was found dead in a parking lot in the nearby town of Fairview, Massachusetts. Carter has been charged with involuntary manslaughter and could face up to twenty years in prison if convicted., The Prosecution’s Case: Bristol County prosecutors say that Carter should be convicted because she knowingly and willingly contributed to and encouraged Roy’s death by suicide., But with Carter’s copious and seemingly-damning text messages already accepted as evidence in court, that’s not the extent of the prosecution’s case., Carter, prosecutors say, had a motive: To gain attention, sympathy, and popularity from her peers, who she felt didn’t otherwise like her or want her friendship., Carter, the prosecution says, wanted to bask in the attention of playing the role of the “grieving girlfriend,” and encouraged Roy’s suicide to accomplish that goal., The Defense: Lawyers for Carter have yet to present their full case., But in opening remarks, Carter’s attorney, Joseph Cataldo, outlined two main defenses -- neither denying that Carter had sent the infamous text messages, but arguing instead that Carter committed no crime and that she is not the monster depicted by the prosecution., Cataldo focused first and foremost on a simple argument: Roy’s death, he said, was a tragic case of suicide; “But not a homicide.”, Roy, he argued had been suffering from depression and/or other mental health challenges for years – sine long before he met Michelle Carter., Roy had spent years trying various medicinal remedies for his depression to little avail That was one reason, Cataldo said, that Roy had already been contemplating suicide., But Cataldo also suggested that his defense of Carter will also show that Carter herself was struggling with various mental health issues. Carter, the defense has suggested, was herself adjusting to anti-depressant medications that may have affected her behavior., While the prosecution has made strong use of text messages and other communications that occurred in the days and weeks around Roy’s suicide, the defense argues that it will show that Carter in fact tried to help Roy with his struggles, at times recommending that he seek professional help when he was reluctant., Is it a crime to be a bad person? For all the shocking depictions of Michelle Carter presented so far – and they are many– the legal foundations of this case may be far less sensational., Carter is not, after all, being tried for being a bad person; nor is she being charged with “bullying.”, Instead, the case rests on whether Carter’s actions, even if deplorable, rise to the level of involuntary manslaughter – direct responsibility, in other words, for Roy’s death., It was this point to which Carter lawyer Cataldo returned again and again in his opening remarks., Roy ultimately made the decision, Cataldo said., It was, he said a “tragic suicide.”, “But this is not a homicide.”, The case of Commonwealth v Michelle Carter is ongoing.

It’s a right because you can't function in a competitive free market society without minimal health,” he said. “If you can’t walk, if you can’t sleep, if you can’t do physical functions, if you need assistance, if you're too sick and bed bound, then you can’t have equal opportunity.”, Caplan called it a “key and obvious moral point of justice” that there shouldn’t be differences in access to healthcare for rich and poor Americans., “To be fair, we have had this for a long time, through many administrations,” he said. “The ACA helped; Trump’s policy will reverse that, particularly slashing funding for Medicaid, which will increase disparities, not help.”, Caplan said he was not optimistic about Congress letting this news affect its policies., “Is Congress going to care? Well, already they’re indicating they don’t care by trying to knock these people off the Medicaid rolls,” he said., Caplan said New York, Nevada and California have already floated policies that would lessen the disparity in access between rich and poor. He predicted that other states will probably pick up the burden to insure their citizens, since the federal government is unlikely to change its tune., “No, I don’t think Congress gives a hoot,” he said. “They seem hell-bent on saving money, and they don’t seem to care about health.”, Art Caplan is the Drs.

909,[Purple Tables Make Dining Out Easier For Families Dealing With Alzheimer's And Other Conditions],"[June is Alzheimer’s and Brain Awareness month. According to the local chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, 120,000 people in Massachusetts who are over the age of 65 live with the disease., One Massachusetts restaurant is leading the way for families dealing with Alzheimer’s, dementia, autism and post-traumatic stress disorder. It’s not through research or fundraising, it’s through a routine dinner reservation. Red Raven restaurant in Acton is one restaurant using Purple Table Reservations to make life easier for some families., Sam Sexer and her mother are enjoying a healthy lunch in a beautiful setting at Red Raven. Sexer said she always gives her mom the window seat to look out at the lake. It may seem like nothing out of the ordinary, but it means the world to Sexer. Her mother, Julie, was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, so going out to eat has become more difficult. , “I tried to look for other restaurants and I had kind of given up a bit, so to hear about this place and the reservation was great for us,"" Sam Sexer said., The reservation is called Purple Table and was created by the Red Raven restaurant owner Jenifer Apazidis, who explained how the reservations work. , “Someone can call up, make a Purple Table reservation, and that reservation flag basically tells us that someone is coming in that may be living with Alzheimer’s, living with dementia, have a child with autism, so basically someone in that party might need a little extra care and attention and patience while we are serving them,"" Apazidis said., That means seating families in a quiet area of the restaurant and servers exercising patience to repeat menu items more than once. Apazidis says the staff have been trained to approach the table a little differently, to speak patiently and to not clang plates at the table. She says the idea came out of her own experience., “My mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in her late 50s and one of her favorite things to do was go out to eat,"" Apazidis said. ""We found that as her disease progressed, it was really difficult for her to go out to eat and communicate with the servers.”, Apazidis and her family stopped going out as a result, but she didn’t believe that was a good solution for her family or others, so she started Purple Table Reservations. One of the specially-trained servers is Jackson Shoults, who says he enjoys it., “It’s just any folks that might need a little extra amenities when they go out to eat, whether that’s time, attention, caring, explaining, you know, whatever it may be,"" he said. ""So working with them, it’s just going the extra mile.”, Shoults says the biggest part of his training is patience, which goes a long way for the families., “Usually they are very happy to go out and be able to do something that some people might find normal and mundane, but for them it’s a little bit special,"" he said., For Sam Sexer and her mom Julie, a nice time out to eat makes life a little easier after a tough diagnosis. Sexer explained why. , “To kind of feel at peace, to be able to come out and not just have to go to a fast food-type place, to feel a little more comfortable,"" Sexer said. , Purple is significant because Alzheimer's disease awareness is represented by the color purple. There are plans to create a national model for Purple Table Reservations that restaurants across the country can adopt., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"
910,[District Attorneys Send Notices To Thousands Of Dookhan Defendants],"[More than 19,000 letters went out today to defendants whose drug charges were wiped away due to misconduct by disgraced forensic chemist Annie Dookhan. A few hundred more whose convictions will remain on the books will receive notices advising them of their legal rights., Dookhan tested drug evidence for nearly a decade at the former Hinton laboratory in Jamaica Plain. She was arrested in 2012 for tampering with samples and falsifying reports. After three years in prison, Dookhan was released on parole in April 2016., The Massachusetts top court ruled in January that the “extraordinary magnitude” of Dookhan’s impropriety required prosecutors to reexamine thousands of convictions. In April, seven district attorney offices agreed to permanently dismiss more than 21,000 cases tainted by Dookhan. Many of these were for misdemeanor drug possession or other charges in lower courts., Prosecutors identified approximately 300 cases which they would not drop. District attorneys certified these cases could be successfully defended against appeal even without evidence handled by Dookhan., The Supreme Judicial Court’s ruling required that all affected defendants be notified of their status., “It is important for you, and for our system of justice, that you know about your rights if your case was one of those affected,” said SJC Chief Justice Ralph Gants in a video posted to the court’s website in late May., Attorneys from the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the state’s public defender agency, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, which represented a handful of Dookhan defendants, met regularly with prosecutors for several months to determine logistics for delivering the notice letters., “The notice planning process following the January 2017 SJC decision has been good,” said Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts. “The court, the DAs, the ACLU and CPCS have all worked well together.”, Last fall, district attorney offices mailed their own letters to thousands of Dookhan defendants. But the SJC determined these notices were “wholly inadequate.” The envelopes had the appearance of junk mail, the letters failed to adequately explain recipients’ legal rights, and the Spanish versions were poorly translated, the court found., , Defendants with dismissed cases will receive a letter listing the precise charges and counts that are now vacated. Notices will be sent to each individual’s last known address by regular mail., Those whose convictions have not been dropped will receive a longer packet with information about challenging Dookhan cases in court. These packets were sent by certified mail., The Suffolk County District Attorney’s Office sent more than 100 of the second category of letters, including to one defendant still in custody on charges stemming from an armed robbery of oxycontin from a pharmacy., All materials were sent in English and Spanish, with accompanying summaries in Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Vietnamese and other languages. The Committee for Public Counsel Services has created a hotline to answer questions about the letters or for those who believe they should have received a packet but did not. The CPCS hotline number is 1-888-999-2881., The seven district attorney offices — Bristol, Essex, Cape and Islands, Middlesex, Norfolk, Plymouth and Suffolk — were responsible for all costs associated with sending the notices., The court also ordered the district attorneys to pay $7,500 for a social media advertising campaign to reach those without a permanent address or whose addresses may have changed. The campaign launched last week in both Spanish and English on accounts managed by the ACLU of Massachusetts., ""The work continues — outreach is ongoing, notices to affected individuals went out today, and representatives throughout the court system and criminal justice system in our working group have worked very hard to make this happen,"" said Special Master Margot Botsford, who recently retired from the SJC but was appointed to oversee implementation of the court’s January ruling., Shawn Musgrave can be reached at shawnmusgrave@gmail.com or on Twitter @shawnmusgrave.

Bond’s remains washed up on Deer Island two years ago this month and it took investigators months to identify her. McCarthy was the boyfriend of the toddler's mother, Rachelle Bond, who was charged as an accessory after the fact and cut a deal with prosecutors in exchange for her testimony. The defense claims it was she who killed the little girl. Also in Massachusetts, opening statements start tomorrow in the trial of Michelle Carter – the teenager accused of persuading a friend to kill himself.

921,[MIT Researcher To President Trump: Don't Cherry Pick Our Data],"[BARBARA HOWARD: President Donald Trump cited MIT research yesterday, in laying out his case for pulling out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. But the scientists behind that research? They dispute the president's interpretation of their work. With us on the line is John Reilly. He is co-director of MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, the group whose work Trump cited. Thanks for being with us, Dr. Reilly., JOHN REILLY: Thank you., BARBARA HOWARD: So, when the president cited your study, he said, and I’ll quote, “Even if the Paris agreement were implemented in full with total compliance from all nations, it’s estimated it would produce only a two-tenths of one degree Celsius reduction in global temperature by the year 2100.” And he went on to say that that’s a quote, “tiny, tiny amount.” What’s wrong with that?, JOHN REILLY: Well, that’s the incremental effect of just Paris. There’s been previous policy agreements before, and so if you add all of those up, we think you’re avoiding about a full one degree of warming. So that’s getting us away the four and five, down to the 3.5 or so…, BARBARA HOWARD: Degrees?, JOHN REILLY: Degrees, warming by 2100. So that’s some progress. We still have a lot more to do, certainly that’s the case. No one believes that the Paris Agreement is the last thing we’re going to do. It includes a process for revisiting, revising and extending the agreement., BARBARA HOWARD: Well the, the path we’re on, of increased carbon emissions, it’s not like it can sort of turn on a dime. It sounds like, it’s a, inertia is with you, you’re going to have to slow it down and then start reversing it?, JOHN REILLY: The whole energy sector and the climate system is a giant oil tanker that you have to turn slowly, slowly, slowly. So if you don’t continue, making that turn, you’ll never get to where you want to be, right?, BARBARA HOWARD: Okay. And so, what would it mean though if we don’t turn?, JOHN REILLY: Then we’re going to end up with, you know, something on the order of four or five degrees warming by 2100. That’s going to result in, really, a lot of disruption. We’ve seen a lot of heat deaths in places like India and Europe already from the warming we’ve seen. We’re seeing the disappearance of Arctic ice, we’re seeing some melting of the Greenland ice sheet. All of those things at four and five degrees would turn into a disaster., BARBARA HOWARD: Now, did the White House communicate with you or with your colleagues before citing your study?, JOHN REILLY: No, it was a complete surprise. In fact, we were a bit confused. We weren’t sure which paper they were citing. We’ve done several of them, so it took us by complete surprise., BARBARA HOWARD: Well all the work you’ve put in to see it cited this way, how are your colleagues taking this?, JOHN REILLY: Well, we — all of us here believe the Paris Agreement was an important step forward, so, to have our work used as an excuse to withdraw it is exactly the reverse of what we imagined hoping it would do. We hoped it would solidify the idea that the Paris Agreement was moving us forward. In fact, you know, our goal of just looking at this incremental effect was to emphasize that yes, it was a step forward but a lot more was needed to be done. Not that we reverse ourselves., BARBARA HOWARD: Are you planning any kind of a response?, JOHN REILLY: Well we are trying to get our message out. MIT has released a, a release just to kind of clarify our view of it and try to get more of the story out so that people aren’t confused., BARBARA HOWARD: This sounds like for you and for your colleagues it’s your life’s work. What is it like personally for you to have it used this way?, JOHN REILLY: Well, this isn’t the first time. You know I’ve been working on the climate issue all my career, for, you know, 35 years. I mean, it’s, at this point it’s not, it’s not … I’m less concerned about my personal career, I’m more concerned about where the planet … I’m sorry …, BARBARA HOWARD: Yeah, go ahead., JOHN REILLY: Where the pla-, where the planet is heading., BARBARA HOWARD: I’m so sorry., JOHN REILLY: Yeah., BARBARA HOWARD: Alright, thanks for joining us Dr. Reilly., JOHN REILLY: Thank you., BARBARA HOWARD: That's John Reilly. He’s co-director of MIT's Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change.

But human trials are just around the corner., “We’ve found genes that control the aging process — and they exist in all of us — and we’ve found molecules that regulate those things,” he explained. “We’ve put this little molecule in the water of the mice, they drink it … they run almost twice as far and they feel younger.”, Sinclair has noted similar effects in his own body since he himself began taking the experimental drug a year ago., “I do feel like I can run farther, I think better, I don’t get tired, I can speak faster,” said Sinclair, adding, “I don’t get jetlag anymore, thank goodness.” The findings of his subjective analyses have been reinforced by blood test results. “According to those, I’m younger … about ten years.”, The physical and mental ameliorations listed by Sinclair, who co-directs Harvard’s Glenn Center for the Biology of Aging, highlight what he hopes to achieve with this research: to improve the quality of the aging process., “Often, people think that I’m just trying to keep people alive in nursing homes; it’s the complete opposite,” said Sinclair. “There’s going to be a future where we can look forward to being in our eighties and nineties, not worry about getting cancer in our fifties or sixties … and that’s keeping people out of nursing homes.”, When asked whether the public should be at all skeptical, Sinclair responded, “I think that we should be more optimistic than ever… I was a pioneer early on, but now there are dozens of companies and scientists working towards this goal.” He does acknowledge that that optimism must be tempered, given the typically slow developments of FDA-approved, prescribable drugs., “The fastest drug ever approved was four years, so we’re look at probably that timeframe,” said Sinclair, “but four years is not long to wait, considering humanity’s waited ten thousand years or more.”]"

927,"[Full Contact, No Helmet: Why Is Rugby On The Rise?]","[Listen here for the radio version of this story: , , When Craig Mackenzie started playing rugby nearly two decades ago, he joined his father’s club team because there were few other options. Today, rugby is one of the country’s fastest growing team sports. Programs cater to kids as young as six, and this year, the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association recognized high school rugby as a varsity sport. , “I’m the coach for two other varsity sports,” said MacKenzie, who coaches rugby at Brookline High School. “The kids that are playing rugby are putting just as much into it, so it’s good that it’s finally being recognized.”, High school rugby players are getting their due at a time of heightened concern over sports-related concussions. There’s evidence that participation in tackle football, the sport most often linked to head trauma, is declining. Data from the National Federation of State High School Associations shows 24,000 fewer high school kids nationwide played football in 2015 compared to five years prior. Sports and Fitness Industry Association numbers indicate tackle football participation among all age groups dropped nine percent during those same years, while participation in rugby rose 47 percent., Rugby’s growth may seem counter-intuitive. Like football, it’s a contact sport built around tackling the opponent. There’s a key difference that would seem to make rugby more dangerous than football: players wear no helmets or pads.  , “The main focus of rugby is safety,” said Peter Hopkins, a Brookline High senior who plays both sports. ""In football you have pads on, so you just feel invincible. You don't really think about how you're trying to tackle because you have all that protection."", Lose the helmets and pads and rugby enthusiasts say players are less likely to turn their bodies into human torpedoes, and more likely to master a rugby fundamental: a tackle that’s something like a bear hug., During an afternoon practice MacKenzie demonstrated a tackle with one of his players.  , “My body just hugged alongside and let his own momentum, his own weight, fall forward,” said MacKenzie. “That’s technically a tackle, but I haven’t really put a collision in there.”, In the sports medicine division at Boston Children’s Hospital, Dr. John Corrado says he sees evidence that rugby hits are generally less severe than what he sees among football players., , “We see plenty of concussions in rugby, but the head injuries in rugby tend to be more of a glancing blow, scalp lacerations and ear injuries rather than head-to-head injuries. I think it really comes back to speed of impact,"" said Corrado., Chris Nowinski, a former college football player and founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, agrees rugby has a different approach to tackling than football.  , “But I don’t think we have the evidence to say it’s safer or more dangerous than the tackling we see in American football,” said Nowinski.  ""We've only started studying rugby the same way we study American football. Until we have data, it may be subjective as to which type of tackling is causing the brain more trauma."", Nowinksi points out that Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease found in the brains of hundreds of former football players, has also been discovered in rugby players., “There’s no question that any sport in which you’re tackling people to the ground is going to carry a risk of concussion, and going to carry a risk of CTE,"" said Nowinski., Nowinski says his group is not against high school students playing contact sports, if they’re played safely., “The pendulum has swung so far that any danger is being taken off the field immediately now,” said MacKenzie, who also coaches football. “Right now in both sports, if there’s any sort of big collision, that player’s being removed from the sport."", Along with the risks, rugby, like any team sport, offers the benefit of keeping kids healthy and learning new skills. High school athletic directors pushed for rugby to become a varsity sport because there’s a role for anyone who wants to play, regardless of size, speed or gender.   , “I’ve never played a ball sport where you catch or kick balls or anything,” explained Isabelle Cotney, a Brookline High junior., After she played her first few rugby games this spring, she asked coach MacKenzie to let her play a position that allows her to do more of what she loves about the game: tackle the opponent., “I can’t describe the feeling when I’m on the field,” said Cotney. “You can’t get that any other way.”, Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

932,[Massachusetts Drivers Could Improve Seatbelt Use ],"[The 2016 Massachusetts Safety Belt Usage Observation Study conducted by the University of Massachusetts Traffic Safety Research Program (UMassSafe) for the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security’s Highway Safety Division says while seat belt use is rising in Massachusetts, it could be better., Greater Boston's Tina Martin took a ride with a Framingham police officer during the department's recent ""Click It or Ticket"" campaign. Officer Ken Blass does traffic enforcement. During the morning, he pulls people over for offenses like distracted driving. Once he pulls them over, he says he then looks for seat belt safety., “We aren’t able to pull over a violator for not wearing their seat belt as a primary offense,"" he said. ""However, any other offense, we would stop them.”, The ""Click It or Ticket” campaign is paid for by the state and puts extra police on the road. Officer Blass says he hears all kinds of reasons for why people aren’t buckled up., “A lot of people would say 'I thought I had it on' or 'I just took it off'.”, One of Officer Blass’ first stops admitted she wasn’t wearing her seat belt. She didn’t give her name, but gave an honest answer., “It’s not a good reason, but I’m taking my dog to the vet and I was reaching over to grab something and I unbuckled it and never put it back on.”, This driver is not alone. A recent study done by UMassSafe indicates that Massachusetts ranked 45th in the country for seat belt use, but the study says seat belt use in the state is at about 80 percent. That seems like a high number, but many other states ranked higher., , Dr. Stephanie Nitzschke, a trauma surgeon at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, says because of campaigns like ""Click It or Ticket,"" people are wearing seat belts., “Our hospital numbers show that about 60 percent of our patients are restrained drivers and wearing their seat belts."", Of the other 40 percent, Nitzschke says it’s clear when they come into the emergency room that they have not worn a seat belt., “They’ve clearly been thrown out of the vehicle or they’ve been tossed around inside the vehicle,"" she said. ""You can see they have lots of long bone fractures, rib fractures.”, Dr. Nitzschke say she sees less injuries with people wearing seat belts and a shorter recovery time., If that’s not enough incentive to buckle up, drivers get a $35 ticket on top of the initial offense. In the case of the woman who didn’t have her seat belt on, Officer Blass let her off with a warning. But she’s still not convinced. , “To be honest, its very uncomfortable, it’s just that simple,"" she said. , Police say something as simple as a click of a belt can save your life., State Rep. Jeffrey Roy of Franklin introduced a bill this session to increase the seat belt fine from $35 to $50. As with every bill, this will be heard at a public hearing and lawmakers will consider all written and oral testimony. , Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"
933,[Rep. Joe Kennedy Talks JFK's Legacy And Current D.C. Drama],"[This week marks 100 years since the birth of John F. Kennedy, who, at age 43, became the youngest person ever elected to the presidency, only to be assassinated less than three years into his term. Kennedy's great-nephew, Rep. Joe Kennedy, joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston to discuss his great-uncle's legacy., “He's somebody that … inspired an awful lot of people across this country and around the world, but he's also a person,” said Kennedy. “He was a dad and a son and brother and a father."", “The vision that President Kennedy had for America — the way that he tried to practice politics, recognizing that there are connections that we share as Americans, as human beings. I think real leadership finds those connections, strengthens them, celebrates them and channels them to take on a big challenge. I don't think that's the way the current president of the United States addresses politics.”, One of the biggest congressional battles that has been waged since President Donald Trump has taken office is the American Health Care Act, which the house has passed and is now in the hands of the senate., , “That bill is an act of malice, not an act of mercy,” said Kennedy, recalling House Speaker Paul Ryan’s recent claim. “When you define success as taking health care away from 23 million people ... gutting what insurance actually means — the quality of care that's actually delivered — and destroying it, when you say that we can pass a $600 billion tax cut onto the wealthy by cutting $880 billion for health care for families who are working paycheck to paycheck ... that's not who we are as a nation. It’s not who we are as a people and America can do better than that.”, Kennedy went on to praise Gov. Charlie Baker’s outspoken criticism of the health care bill., “I think that he has a unique opportunity to explain to other … Republican leaders … what this bill will do to their state and what it will do for health care across the country,” he said. “Massachusetts is the leader in the nation when it comes to health care reform and we need folks here regardless of party, because regardless of party, this bill is going to destroy what health care means for all Americans.”, Kennedy, a former state prosecutor, also waded into the ongoing controversy over claims of Russian interference in the presidential election and the actions Trump has taken in recent weeks, including firing former FBI Director James Comey., “I have very strong concerns, based on what is publicly available, that you could certainly make a credible case that he did obstruct justice,” Kennedy said. “The crux of this inquiry here is whether President Trump decided to put his interests and the interests of his family in front of the interests of the American people ... I have grave concerns that he has [crossed a line]. That investigation, though, needs to play out, which is why we need to have confidence in the way that investigation is held.”, Despite the democrats currently being in the minority and fighting an uphill battle in both chambers, on the subject of leadership, Kennedy did not waver., “I've got full faith and confidence in Leader [Nancy] Pelosi,” he said. “There's no one that I have greater confidence in to fight for the American public and the values of the American people … and to make sure that we do the best we possibly can under very tough circumstances. It’s where she’s at her best.”, Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"

936,[Trying To Find An Economic Balance In The Battle For Dudley Square's Future],"[A pretty good crowd comes through Dudley Dough in Roxbury at midday for their huge pizza slices. But manager Luther Pinckney says overall, business isn’t great., “We’re not struggling, but we’re definitely not making money,” he said., Dudley Dough was started here last October by Haley House — a nonprofit that runs a soup kitchen and other social programs. Their goal is to pay workers $20 an hour, plus hourly bonuses. But they’re not getting there, because Pinckney says there’s just not enough customers nights and weekends., “The problem is most of the housing in Dudley is low-income, by far,"" he said. ""And so you have them just not being able to afford anything extra. Not that ours is any more expensive. They just don’t have the money to go out and eat.”, Pinckney says he’d like to see more development in the area that brings people with higher incomes to live in Dudley Square – to help support businesses like his. He grew up here, and he does have some concerns about how that might change his community. But he says some people are going too far in fighting gentrification., “They fight every development, fight every building that might be put up,"" he said. ""And don’t get me wrong, certain things need to be fought and communities need to be engaged. But it needs to be managed and it needs to be worked through. It can’t be a complete blockade on both sides.”, In a way, he seems both resigned and hopeful about the future., “There’s no way that gentrification is not going to happen,"" he said. ""I mean, it’s already in full swing. It’s a matter of managing it, again, so that the people who are in that community aren’t disrespected, totally lost.”, It’s a challenge that city planners are trying to tackle with meetings like one held recently at the Boys and Girls Club near Dudley Square. About a half dozen community members and several city planners sat around a table with a map of the Dudley Square neighborhood in front of them, as several other tables did the same. And they had a bunch of poker chips. The goal of the exercise was to come to some agreement on what kind of developments should go on each of five different city-owned properties — and mark that with different colored poker chips., “I’d certainly like to see home ownership that is also subsidized home ownership,"" said one of the community members., , ""And that requires three market rate chips to support it,” said a moderator from the Boston Planning and Development Agency., Here’s where things get controversial. The rules say for every chip they put down signifying subsidized, low-income housing, they have to put down three chips in the same spot representing more expensive, market-rate housing. But a few at the table, including Michael Prentice, a local community activist, didn't like those rules. He asked why that much market-rate housing was necessary., “Are we in a rush? Why are we in a rush?"" Prentice asked. ""If the market-rate unit ... if we can’t find a sustainable way to do it on your model, why can’t we take our time and find other ways to do it?”, Sue Sullivan, who runs an association of businesses in the area, chimed in., “There is a rush,"" she said, ""if we want to get in on an economic cycle that we have now.”, It’s an idea that’s echoed by city planners. The economy is good right now, and that means now is the time to create developments. Prentice, the community activist fighting gentrification, says he’s not against the idea of Dudley Square being a mixed-income community. It’s how the city plans to get there that he disagrees with., “They’re bringing in, you know, wealthier students, wealthier white people, wealthier people who are not from this area,"" he complained. ""We are capable of building up economic diversity here.”, Prentice and some others at the meeting were angry about a big residential building that’s already been approved for the square. Of the 700 units at the so-called Tremont Crossing development, about 100 of them are set aside for low-income housing., John Barros, the chief of economic development for the city, said the money that market-rate units bring in is the only way the city can pay for the low-income subsidies., “Because we don’t have the help and support of federal government to continue our affordable housing growth,” Barros said., Also, Barros said they have to ask the question — just how much subsidized, affordable housing is good for a community? He said evidence shows mixed-income communities are better for everybody., “So that means when we look at individual developments, that we’re trying to make sure they make sense for the overall stock of housing in that neighborhood,"" Barros said. ""And in a neighborhood where you have 75 percent of all units being affordable and subsidized, then that creates a different challenge for what the new developments should be bringing.”, Barros calls Dudley Square the heart of Boston. And as planners struggle to find that balance, all across the city, between subsidized, affordable housing and market-rate homes that bring money and changes to communities, he says Dudley Square is an indicator of what kind of city Boston is going to be. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
937,[How Scallops Helped New Bedford Rebuild Its Economy],"[Tammy  — a woman in her mid-30s — stands on a pier in New Bedford holding a baby and waving in the direction of the Atlantic ocean as her boyfriend’s boat edges toward shore.,  Asked how the work is going, Tammy said, “Oh, pretty good I guess. They always [have] work, so they’re always busy, month to month to month ... I don’t hear no complaining over here with their boat."", Another scallop boat docked just yards away is captained by a fisherman named Lionel, and manned by a crew that includes his college-educated son, Tony. , , “I used to fish with these guys a long time ago, but I took a short break,"" Tony said. ""Now, I’m back on here to pay off my college loans.” , And the fish houses here in New Bedford — buffeted for years by the ebbs and flows of ground fish profits — are today flush with cash., “There’s not the ground fish industry that there used to be here in New Bedford, but scallops have more than picked up in the interim.”, Sean Moriaty is Vice President for Sales at Blue Harvest Fisheries. “Where the last few years, the harvest was down in the 35 to 40 million pound range, we think this year it will be up to 50 million pounds, so significant volume being landed. The prices of scallops, as the quota went down, jumped up significantly, as much as a 50 percent increase in price.”   , , And Moriaty said that’s due in no small measure to the French, who are the biggest buyers of U.S. scallops. And that affinity for coquilles Saint-Jacques is doing wonders for the city, says New Bedford’s Harvard-educated mayor, Jon Mitchell., “New Bedford is the largest commercial fishing port in America by value of annual landings, and we are the center of the commercial fishing industry on the east coast,"" he said. ""Landings here in New Bedford are about eight times the size of what they are in Gloucester and the Lion's Share of the landings nowadays, as measured by dollars, are in scallops.”   , , New Bedford has seen the sharpest drop in unemployment this past year among more than 300 cities surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It has one of the fastest growing art scenes in the area; revived music festivals and a proliferation of new downtown restaurants and re-invigorated older ones., “The name of the restaurant here is Freestone's City Grill,"" said Joe Costa, the restaurant's manager. ""Freestone's has been here in downtown New Bedford since 1979, so 38 years now.” , And Joe Costa says business is good. “Much better. There was a time when Freestone's City Grill was one of the only restaurants in downtown, and now there are many restaurants downtown. Everyone's doing really well, everyone’s doing very well.""   , , Costa says the fishing industry is contributing mightily to the success of the restaurant business. ""We get the freshest product possible. Right here. Everybody gets it,"" said Costa. ""Downtown New Bedford is known for its scallops. Scallops are really ... they’re like currency. It’s amazing.”  , And that metaphorical currency is being doled out broadly across New Bedford’s business landscape., “Carter's Clothing. Kind of a dinosaur, been here for 70 years. My grandfather started it and [it's] chugging along, just kinda going with the flow,"" said Kevin Carter. He runs Carter’s Clothing, which has been a New Bedford feature on this cobblestone road for decades. Fishermen and businessmen alike buy clothing, says Carter, and he’s having one of the store’s best years in memory., , “A lot of new money coming into the area, restaurants popping open, a boutique hotel under construction as we speak,"" Carter said. ""Tourist season, we see more and more every year. It's been a great uptick.”, But the scallop boom fueling New Bedford’s growth could also be the city’s downfall. It’s a fear underscored by Tony, the fisherman., “Today we got bad news,"" he said. ""There's a lot of boats bringing in 50 to 60,000 pounds from this new area that opened up down below New York, and that's affecting the price because we get paid supply and demand.”  , And that’s one of the reasons that New Bedford has been working to diversify its economy and job force, with new manufacturing and planned investments in the wind power industry. But the principal focus, said Mayor Jon Mitchell, is on expanding New Bedford as a major tourist destination on the east coast. With 700 artists living here, the music festivals and new restaurants, and a maritime history that inspired Herman Melville’s ""Moby-Dick,"" Mitchell sees New Bedford in the image of two cities — one to the north, one to the south., , “We look at places like Portland (Maine) — which is smaller than New Bedford, but a place that has a good mix of maritime and artistic assets — as a good model for us,"" said Mitchell. ""Another one that's bigger is Charleston, S.C., a place that has seen a lot of success because it's capitalized on its distinct architecture, its arts community, as well as a really vibrant restaurant scene.”, Mitchell said as much as he would like to emulate those two cities, he has one thing that they don’t: scallops. , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"
938,[New Bedford Fishery Workers Spooked By Rumors Of Impending Immigration Raid],"[Rumors have been circulating for months on the docks of New Bedford. Workers have been hearing that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents are coming. , Jon Mitchell, New Bedford’s Harvard-educated mayor, told WGBH News, “It’s hard to tell whether some of those reports are apocryphal or whether they reflect an actual enforcement initiative, but either way it's putting individuals on edge.”  , And those rumors have gained greater currency with reported sightings of official Homeland Security vehicles in the area. Denise Porché, Executive Director of the Island Foundation, said, “I saw a Homeland Security command center on Route 24. It was as tall as an 18-wheeler. And it was brand-spanking new and white with the big Homeland Security seal on it.”, , , “Well, I have seen the vans also,” said Helena DaSilva Hughes in a separate interview. She heads New Bedford’s Immigrant’s Assistance Center. “They’re around New Bedford. They’re calling me and saying they [saw] two big vans. The fear is very much alive about what can happen in New Bedford.” , , The dock on this overcast day is lined with fishing boats. A young fisherman named Tony, wearing bright overalls and a broad smile, had just come to port. Tony, who’s from the Azores, said the boats here are from various parts of the world, and so are the crews. , “There’s Polish, there’s Azoreans, and there’s Mexican vessels,"" he said. ""There’s Vietnamese vessels, too.”, Tony said some fishermen may be in the country illegally, but undocumented immigrants work mostly in the fish houses., , “Everyone knows that the fish houses, you know, there are a lot of undocumented populations that are working in New Bedford,” said DaSilva-Hughes. “They are doing jobs that no one else would do.” , DaSilva-Hughes adds that the work is hard — really hard. She said fish processing relies heavily on undocumented immigrants like a woman from El Salvador, who asked that we call her Lupe. , “Yes, I work in a fish processing plant and I do various kinds of work there,"" she said in Spanish. ""I work with codfish and I work with salmon and I sometimes have to filet the codfish or take out the bones in the salmon, so, you know, I do all sorts of different things at the company.” , Lupe nervously rubbed her calloused hands together and spoke about an immigration raid 10 years ago, when she was one of the more than 300 mainly Central American workers swept up in a mass apprehension by ICE agents on a local factory. , ""Yes of course, of course, I'm feeling the same kind of fear, especially when I talk to my son,"" she said. ""My son was born here and he had asked me about life back in El Salvador: ‘Do they have some schools that you can study at in English?’ So it's just a level of fear of thinking about these kinds of things, and it's affecting my son this time also.”, , Lupe said she was anxious about the ICE vehicles that many here have seen, and said she’s worried especially about her son, and what might happen if she’s picked up again. He was born here, she said, and has no idea about life back in El Salvador., Walking along the docks, Denise Porché said fish processing workers like Lupe have every reason to have fear, given the size of Homeland Security vehicle she spotted on Route 24.   , “No one's going to have a vehicle that big and take on that presence if they're not going to utilize this Command Center,"" she said., Corinn Williams runs the Community Economic Development Center, located right smack in the middle of New Bedford’s largest Central American neighborhood. She said she gets why the ICE vans are so scary to immigrants here, but she cautioned against jumping to conclusions., “I think it's important to separate between the rumors and the day-to-day activity of law enforcement,"" she said. ""I think there's more aggressive enforcement, but at the same time you know there's federal agencies that regulate the ports, there has been some issue with human trafficking. Seeing ICE vehicles could have to do with customs enforcement, as well some of those vehicles are around in the vicinity anyway."", In an emailed response to a query from WGBH News, an ICE official said the agency never uses marked vehicles and would never comment about future operational activity. So, “whatever is going on in New Bedford is likely another agency and not ICE.”, Regardless of what ICE says, Corinn Williams hopes Trump Administration officials understand the impact targeted arrests on fish processing houses would have on the local economy. , “We're the No. 1 Seaport in the United States today in terms of dollar value,"" said Williams. ""It’s a billion-dollar industry that has a multiplier effect throughout the community from the person who's working at a processing plant to people working on the vessels, so the repercussions in such an important industry in New Bedford would be catastrophic."", , New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell sees less dire consequences for the city — it’s the residents he’s worried about. , “I'm not terribly concerned about the economic disruption as I am about the families who might be involved in any enforcement action,"" he said. ""There are some scared folks in our community as there are in virtually every community in the United States that has a large immigrant population.”, The emptiness of an area along the dock near a fish plant seems to exemplify that fear. Until recently, one worker told me, some of the guys from Guatemala and El Salvador would linger, smoke and talk at the end of the day, while glancing out on the harbor. But today, the space was empty. Few seemed to be taking a chance that the rumors and vehicle sightings are untrue., ,  , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

943,[EPA Workers March in Boston to Protest Trump Budget Cut],"[Employees of the regional EPA office in Boston and environmental activists protested today against President Trump’s proposed cuts to the agency — putting aside their usual reluctance to step into politics., More than 50 EPA workers and supporters marched from their regional headquarters in Post Office Square to voice anger about Trump’s funding cuts., ""We're marching to the State House and around to the Common, because the current cuts that the president has in his current budget are draconian, and it will prevent EPA from doing its job,"" said Anne Rodney, who administers grants to states, and has worked at the EPA for 30 years., The White House budget would cut EPA spending by 31 percent – although Congress still has to weigh in. , , ""Certainly with every administration there are changes in our priorities, but nothing like this where the whole agency is under attack. I’ve never seen anything like it,"" said Kymberlee Keckler, who works in the superfund program has been with the agency for over three decades., Keckler says she thinks the public is on their side. But, ""I wish there would be more public involvement and people speaking out in praise of some of the things we want to keep,"" she said.  , , Tom Olivier, an EPA attorney whose work focuses on the Clean Air Act, rejects the criticism leveled at the agency by President Trump., ""It's a myth that cleaning up the environment and being in compliance is bad for business, bad for America, bad for employees bad for anybody,"" he said. ""In the work that we do we try to find successful resolutions that everyone can live with and the companies can abide by and prosper by, and that's been my experience for 28 years."", Olivier said he doesn’t believe Trump’s claim that a lot of the environmental regulations can and should be handled by states., ""With the kind of budget cuts that are being proposed, we won’t be able to do state oversight,"" he said. ""And our states in new England have been cutting their personnel and their staff enormously over the past few years, so the states are not in the position to take over what we're doing."", , For Sandra Petrakis, the administration’s actions have already gotten in the way of her work at the EPA. She finished grad school in August, and at the beginning of this year had a tentative offer to work for the EPA., ""And in January, on day one of Trump's presidency, he signed the executive order instating the hiring freeze,"" she said. She’d been waiting to see if the job might still materialize, and got an email just last week. ""That was saying the tentative offers have been rescinded,"" she said. She’s still looking for a job.  , The workers were joined on their march by environmental advocates from groups like the Sierra Club, as well as faith leaders from several religions. One of them was Unitarian Universalist minister Fred Small from the Arlington Street Church in Boston, who led the crowd in a spiritual that called out the EPA’s new administrator, who frequently sued the agency as Oklahoma Attorney General., ""Ain't going to let Scott Pruitt turn me around,"" he sang., , Abby Swaine works for an EPA program that incentivizes shipping and transportation companies to save fuel and reduce greenhouse gases. She said marching, carrying signs and shouting definitely puts her and her colleagues out of their comfort zone. But she said it’s important for the public to see this., ""You know, they've got to see that normal, sort of nerdy people go out and put their wallflower tendencies aside to do what needs to be done,"" she said. ""And everyone should take a little responsibility to speak up."" , , For these workers, it meant a more active lunch hour than usual.,  “Thank you everyone,” union president Steve Calder called out as they reached the EPA regional office again. And with that, they handed off their signs, and headed back inside to get back to work. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
944,[How Did That Star Market End Up Over The Massachusetts Turnpike? ],"[We start things off today in a place I’m confident is familiar to you all, a supermarket. It's very much like any other supermarket. The coffee is near the tea. The butter is near the milk. The shelves are stocked with an abundance of options., But there is one thing that’s unique about this particular supermarket. And that’s what’s happening some 25 feet below: Cars and trucks zipping by at 75 miles an hour. That one can shop for groceries above a major interstate highway has left listener Craig Idlebrook wondering for years, and so he reached out to the Curiosity Desk., In Newton, Massachusetts there’s a Star Market that overhangs the Mass Turnpike. And I was curious why that was, and if that structure was used for something in the past.  –  Craig Idlebrook, Newton, MA. , Even if you’ve never been inside, you’ve likely driven under it. And while the building itself dates to the 1960s, its story begins almost a half century prior., ""The Star Market began in Watertown,"" explained Historic Newton's Clara Silverstein. ""The first one opened in 1915. The owner was named Sarkus Mugar, and he was from Armenia. He started the company with nine hundred dollars borrowed from relatives."", If that name sounds familiar, it should. Sarkis Mugar was the grandfather of David Mugar, the Boston businessman and philanthropist famed for — among other things — being the guy behind the July 4 Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular for decades., Sarkis helmed the Watertown Star Market until 1922, when he died following an automobile accident. His son Stephen took over the operation, and in 1930 opened a second Star Market — this time in Newtonville. (See picture below.) , , Over the next two decades, Stephen Mugar — and his cousin John — expanded the Star Market into a booming family business. Stores were added from Wellesley to Cambridge. But the boldest leap came in 1948, again in Newtonville, with the Star Market’s first large-scale supermarket., Boasting innovations like cellophane-wrapped meats and a luncheonette with microwaves, the grand opening was announced in a theatrical advertisement in the Boston Globe that billed the new Star Market as, ""The first truly different food store in 20 years"" and read, in part:, Never before has there been a store like the great new Newtonville Star Market. See it today! And Marvel at its beauty, its many innovations, its huge variety, its countless shopping conveniences. , Supermarkets may have been the newest thing in food, but post World War II America was a time of new things — and the new Star Market was already on a collision course with the latest thing in roads: the modern highway., Massachusetts had jumped into the highway game in the 1950s with a turnpike that stretched west from the state border with New York all the way to Route 128. By the early 1960s, the push to extend the pike 12 more miles into the heart of Boston was gathering steam. But the controversial route would split in half the villages in-and-around Newton.    , ""And when the Turnpike Authority wanted to go through Newtonville, they wanted to take over the Star Market’s parking lot,"" said Silverstein. , It took years of negotiations, lawyers, politicians and a ruling by the Supreme Judicial Court. But in the end, the Turnpike Authority got its route, and the Mugars were granted the “air rights” to build a new store over top of the new turnpike. In 1963, for the third time in three decades, a Star Market made its debut in Newtonville., ""It was called the Supermarket of the Space Age,"" said Silverstein. , The Boston Globe called the structure “handsome” and described it in a piece on the eve of its June opening., ""There is probably nothing like it anywhere among food supermarkets,"" read the story. ""Interior hues are flame red and off white. Draft-free air conditioning and wide aisles are among the attractive aspects...Spaced among the exterior….translucent plastic panels to be illumined at night."", The success of the Star Market project fueled the imaginations of developers and city leaders, who saw a future with gleaming buildings over the pike all the way from Auburndale to Newton Corner., ""People began to see air rights as a possibly expanding option for these village centers that felt very hemmed in,"" explained Silverstein. , In reality, only one other project would ever be built. And not a single structure has been built with air rights west of the city in almost 50 years., As for the Newtonville Star Market? The company has been bought and sold a few times over the years. And after a stint as a Shaw’s in the mid-2000s, it was once again branded a Star Market. And so it stands over the Turnpike today: A nod to Newton’s past, and to an imagined future that never came to pass., Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"

Among the programs that will see cuts are the Environmental Protection Agency, National Institute of Health, National Science Foundation and the federal student loan program, plus so-called safety-net programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Children’s Health Insurance and Medicaid.

947,[Hands To Heart Center Brings Yoga To The People],"[Breathing deeply, Colleen Kleya smiles as she practices yoga in the basement of the Connolly Library in Jamaica Plain, gracefully working through moves like downward dog and tree pose. However, this is not a traditional yoga class. Strapped to her chest in a baby carrier is Kleya’s seven-month-old daughter. To her left, Kleya’s other daughter, 3, glances up at her mom, mimicking each movement., “Coming together as a community to play yoga is amazing, and it gives these kids such a great footbed to be in their bodies in a time right now where kids are spending way more times sitting in front of screens,” Kleya said. “It’s really great to come together and use this age-old practice to kind of cultivate movement as a community.”, Kleya and her daughters were three of 18 participants who attended the family yoga class, offered by an organization called Hands to Heart Center. For the past three years, HTHC has provided free yoga classes to communities in Boston in an effort to make the practice more accessible to marginalized groups of people., “HTHC shares the healing practice of yoga with people affected by addiction, poverty and trauma in Boston,” said Susan Lovett, founder and director of the organization. “HTHC’s goals are to increase access to yoga for all, to bridge the wellness divide for individuals and communities and to mobilize, train and support yoga teachers as volunteers. Through these goals, HTHC is transforming yoga for equity and social justice.”, According to a study conducted by Yoga Journal and Yoga Alliance, nearly 40 million Americans practice yoga. However, classes can cost up to $20, making yoga virtually inaccessible to people of low-income communities. That’s what makes the increase in organizations like HTHC so special, according to Andrew Tanner, chief ambassador for Yoga Alliance., “Yoga was originally designed for the upper class,” Tanner said. “Modern postural yoga was first taught in India to the royal house and the royal children, so understanding trauma in the modern world and reaching more people is an evolution of yoga, and it’s an important one. It’s considered cutting edge for yoga teachers to have an understanding of how trauma lives in peoples bodies.”, HTHC strives to make the practice more readily available to those communities in need. The classes take place in various public spaces in Boston, such as libraries, community centers, detention units, domestic violence shelters, high-poverty schools, homeless shelters and public housing developments. The organization offers a variety of class styles, including yoga for adults, family yoga, gentle yoga for seniors, trauma-sensitive yoga and yoga for students with special needs, as well as classes taught in Spanish., Each class is taught by volunteers who are certified yoga instructors, meaning they have undergone 200 hours of yoga training. Once accepted by HTHC, the volunteers go through further training that is specific to the organization and its goals, including trauma-informed teaching skills., Anne DeSimone, one of HTHC’s 190 volunteer instructors, currently leads beginner’s yoga classes for adults held at the Eritrean Community Center in Roxbury, and was drawn to organization’s dedication to the community., “When I became a yoga instructor, it was my goal to offer free classes to people who otherwise wouldn’t have access to yoga, so I was very happy to hear that HTHC existed and provided the infrastructure for what I wanted to do,” she said. “In terms of my classes, my goal is really for people to leave feeling better than when they arrived, and for them, whatever their age, whatever their background, whatever is impacting them at the moment, to feel like yoga is accessible to them and something that they can work into their life.”, , Whitney Handrich, who teaches family yoga classes with HTHC, also appreciates the values of diversity and acceptance that the organization promotes., “Hands to Heart Center is about bringing yoga to the people,” Handrich said. “So sometimes, you know, you see these kind of studios, and some are fitness and a workout, and you think it’s like this super flexible, fit body that needs to do it, but yoga really is for everyone, and you just have to find the right style and introduction to it to get involved. I really liked the idea because I think it can be so rewarding to these populations that wouldn’t normally have access, and that’s what Hands to Heart Center does.”, Jordan Levinson teaches family yoga classes with Handrich and discussed the mental and physical benefits of yoga., “I think, first of all, it just gets people to move, which is nice because nowadays a lot of people are just sitting in front of the TV or sitting at a desk, so you get to move your body,” Levinson said. “You also get to kind of clear your mind a little bit. It always makes me happy after I practice yoga, so I hope that everybody else can feel happy too.”, Handrich expanded on the idea that yoga can positively impact the mind., “The mental benefits are kind of infinite,” she said. “You know, really being present in the moment, being more mindful, focusing on your breath, and just when you’re practicing it kind of makes all of your other thoughts disappear because you’re so focused on the moment, and that’s something that hopefully you train and work to develop in the rest of your life.”, Yoga is useful because it can be specially catered to people dealing with a variety of issues and ailments, according to Tanner., “What defines yoga from physical exercise is its relationship to the breath — the breath is the gateway between our body and our emotions,” he said. “Yoga is specifically designed to bring awareness to the situation as it is and bring awareness to where the trauma lies in your body.”, Handrich echoed Tanner’s comments on the healing powers of yoga., “It’s almost like Hands to Heart Center brings yoga to the people who, you could say, maybe need it the most, where they need to reconnect with themselves and heal and, depending on the community, bond with each other and develop trust,” she said. “I mean, we all have our different ups and downs and problems through life, and I think yoga is a really good method to kind of heal those wounds.”, The efforts of organizations like HTHC are not going unnoticed, particularly by industry experts like Tanner., “Hands to Heart Center, these people are pioneers in my opinion, and the work they’re doing is important,” Tanner said. “I think we’re going to see more and more of this yoga reaching out. … Yoga naturally makes people want to give back because it helps you connect with your sense of self. People are naturally kind and want to help others.”, This multimedia story was produced as part of WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy's class in Digital Storytelling and Social Media at Northeastern University.]"
948,[School Of Re-Entry Helps Inmates Prepare For Life After Prison ],"[The School of Re-Entry is the first kind in Massachusetts. It's located inside a minimum-security prison in Roslindale, and focuses on the inmates most likely to re-offend — those without a high school diploma. The school has been open for a little over a year., Matthew Guillou is a student inmate whose typical day consists of moving from one class to another. He explains how he was arrested and charged with prison time years ago., “When I was on the street I was involved in a negative lifestyle,"" Guillou said. ""I had a substance abuse addiction which led to me distributing narcotics to provide for the habit; it's expensive. So ... eventually it led to a three- to four-year incarceration.”, Guillou says when he found out about the school, it was an opportunity he couldn’t pass up., “They put on this presentation for the school over here at the Boston Pre-Release Center,"" he said. ""There was a lot with it, you know, education, the academic part and IT training ... it sounded like a good package, so I signed up."", Guillou didn’t exactly sign up. Inmates like him with low level felonies like drug convictions can apply. Right now, there are 15 participants in the school. There are more than 140 inmates at the prison, but student inmates are housed in a separate area that resembles a college dormitory. There are no bars, just small bedrooms side by side. School headmaster Edward McAdams says this set up is based on research., “The more closely we could emulate a true academic environment in a traditional sense, the more success programs had, so that was key for us as we started to look at this,"" he said., The school — which is about a year old — costs about $300,000 dollars a year to run. The state and private funders share the cost. , “The academic piece focused on students ... that needed high school equivalency, because statistically, they are most likely to re-offend. They are [the] least advantaged,"" McAdams said. ""Then, we looked at what can we do for them. Vocational T-shirt screening is great if you want to work country fairs, but it doesn’t really work for the long term.”, So, most students spend six to eight hours a day in classes, getting computer certification in programs like Microsoft Word, or they can also earn college credits., , Matthew Guillou is already putting his skills to work through a paid internship. The paid internships come from partnerships that Allen Spencer works hard to build. Spencer is Director of Workforce Development at the School of Re-Entry. He says he is focused on getting the men thinking about their future., “We want them to think beyond getting the job and becoming career-minded individuals,"" Spencer said., Matthew Guillou is headed in that direction. He hopes for parole in August. He’s earned college credits and has plans for his future., “When I get out I'll finish the Associates at 64 credits, transfer to UMass Boston do two more years there,"" he said, ""Then I can start law school."", That will be very a long way from where he started., “If the [prison] population is down and the costs are up and recidivism is a real driver of prison costs, then we should be able to look at data to come up with a way to decide whether or not we can reduce prison costs and crime,” said Ben Thompson, Massachusetts Assistant Undersecretary for Re-entry. Thompson helped create the school and joined Greater Boston host Jim Braude to talk about its progress alongside James Fidler, a current School of Re-Entry student., “Right at the beginning, I knew it was going to be different,” said Fidler, who will finish a three-and-a-half-year sentence for drug trafficking in January. “I already completed my HiSET, which is a high school equivalency, and I am already involved in the … drug and alcohol counselor program that I'm about three courses away from completing."", When asked why he is so passionate about this program, Thompson pointed to Fidler., “Data shows every dollar I invest in him, in education and vocational training, I get $3-$5 back as a tax-paying citizen,” Thompson said. “I don't want to spend $60,000 for him to stay in jail because I know what he can do and he's out here, he's earned his HiSET, he's got a potential 12 college credits, he's working on getting custody of his kids.

Calder says the cuts would result in a 20 percent reduction in the agency's workforce nationwide., ""There are some people who are close to retirement age, that just say, 'you know, it's time for me to go. I don't want to see what's going to happen to my agency.' They feel it very personally,"" Calder said., And Calder said some of those more senior staff people with the most institutional knowledge would likely be the first to take buy-out offers. ""So it would really cripple the EPA in many ways by the amount of reductions that are proposed."" , , Calder said there are about 50 EPA programs that the Trump administration wants to eliminate or decrease funding for, including ""quite a few"" focusing on climate change. Trump has called climate change ""a hoax."", Calder said the cut would have a huge impact on their ability to enforce clean air, water and other environmental regulations. And he said he fears over time, without federal enforcement the ""rules of the road"" would change for companies., ""It's now a game of what can a company get away with to maybe increase their profits, and it's sort of a slide to the bottom, that other industries feel as though they have to now ignore environmental regulations,"" Calder said., , Calder said the Trump administration has argued much of the work the EPA does could be done by states. But Calder added that states are already underfunded, and now face an additional cut in the federal funds they receive for such purposes., ""So I don't know how you shift more responsibility to the states and give them less money, and expect them to be effective in their environmental protection,"" he said. , Federal workers are expected to march from the New England regional EPA office in Post Office Square to Boston Common at noon on Wednesday, where they will hold a rally protesting the cuts., ""People, especially in the federal government, feel sometimes their hands are tied, they can't do anything,"" Calder said. ""But they are also citizens.

952,[Has New Balance Created A New Template For Funding Public Transit?],"[, Click the audio player above to listen to the audio version of this story. , Drive along the Mass Pike at rush hour and there’s often a commuter rail speeding into South Station. After 50 years of bypassing Brighton, the train is once again stopping in that neighborhood at a new station called Boston Landing., “It says 16 minutes on the schedule,” said Daniel Jepson, a Brighton resident who commutes to Post Office Square in Boston. “I used to walk to Brighton Center and then the express bus would take nearly an hour, so this will be a huge improvement.”, In some ways, this is an 'everything old is new again' moment for Brighton. Before the Mass Pike was built, the neighborhood was home to three stops along the commuter rail. The new Boston Landing station is a welcome return to the neighborhood’s public transit roots, and at a time when the state struggles to meet demand for expanded public transit service, it is something of a surprise., “If you look at the Green Line extension, which we’ve been hearing about for so many years and is seemingly still not happening,"" said Jepson, ""it’s pretty great that we heard about this a couple of years ago and now here it is already up and running.”, The Boston Landing train stop represents a new way of funding local public transit projects. New Balance, which built its new global headquarters alongside the train tracks in Brighton, paid for the $20 million station., “There certainly has been plans to bring back commuter rail service to this neighborhood,” said Keith Craig, director of New Balance Development Group. ""But with an owner like New Balance, there was a way we could make it happen faster.”, , Craig’s job has nothing to do with sneakers or athletic gear. He’s in charge of turning a patch of old manufacturing buildings that surround the New Balance facility into a destination neighborhood. Like the train stop, it’s called Boston Landing. It features the new Boston Bruins practice facility. Construction crews are also building a training center for the Boston Celtics, along with restaurants, lab space, offices and a 295-unit apartment complex., “There’s a lot of incentive for developers, employers, business owners to use transit to attract customers, residents and employees because they know people want transit,” said Josh Fairchild, founding board member of the nonprofit Transit Matters., Fairchild ticks off other developments where private investors have been in talks to pay for transit upgrades including Harvard University in Allston and Winn Casino in Everett. He says private-public partnerships that may emerge from these large-scale developments are important, but not a panacea for the larger transit system., “Most of the network will not have large employers or huge real estate development that can fund this type of partnership,” said Fairchild. “I don’t think it’s going to be the majority, or even a new model, for what we’re going to see because it simply can’t fund the entire network. There’s only so many opportunities for it to be feasible.”, Paying for much-needed transit repairs, says Fairchild, will cost billions of dollars and he says it’s likely taxpayers, not private industry, that will pick up that tab. He says investment in public transit is imperative not only for companies looking to be competitive, but cities, too., “This region is suffering from a horrible investment in transportation. I think we’re 47th or 48th in the country in congestion and the state of our system,” said Fairchild. ""At the same time, other cities across the country are embarking on investing billions and tens of billions on reinvestment in their system, and we need to be doing the same thing here.”, Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

Most recently, the conflict escalated into a full blown war in 2014., “It is about land. It is about a deal,” Sennott said. “It is about cutting the deal, and maybe the skill sets that President Trump has in that area can be put to good use in Israel-Palestine.”, Still, Sennott advised, “I would not hold your breath.”, He said he was encouraged by the fact that both Israeli and Palestinian officials felt optimistic, and the fact that the Middle East is a “crazy, unpredictable place” might gel well with the Trump administration’s style., “The unpredictability of this administration may very strangely play sort of well in that part of the world, and I don’t think there’s a reason to not be hopeful,” he said. “The saddest part of being in Israel-Palestine is knowing how much the people want peace and how much failure of their leadership on both sides there has been in getting there.”, Charlie Sennott heads up The GroundTruth Project and is a WGBH news analyst.

955,[Deportation Crisis Creates Strains For Boston's Immigration Lawyers],"[The phones won’t stop ringing at Cameron Law Offices, Attorneys at Law, in East Boston, but that may not be the best thing., “People are just calling and calling and walking in, even people who have no problems and are never going to have any problems,” said Matt Cameron, who specializes in immigration law. “Caseloads have certainly increased and the number of detentions has increased. It’s just a lot to process for us.”, Cameron, whose law practice resides in a majority Hispanic neighborhood, said his office has been overwhelmed with clients., Cameron said his firm is looking into recruiting more help to be able to stay on top things. This decision can’t be an easy for him to make. While there has been an increase in cases, Cameron said the firm is struggling financially. This added stress coupled with the hostile environment toward his clients have taken a personal toll and led him to looking into counseling services., “Part of the thing that I’ve had to have counseling for,” said Cameron, “is that I can’t bring myself to charge these people. I barely make any money and it’s become a real struggle.”, When President Donald Trump first issued a ban on refugees and travel from seven majority-Muslim countries, immigration attorneys flooded airports across the country looking to volunteer their services to help immigrants mitigate the chaos and confusion., Now, several months and two struck-down travel bans later, the state of chaos has not dissipated for immigration lawyers. Immigrants of varying legal statuses are still facing uncertainty in the wake of a new priorities memo from the Department of Homeland Security that makes any undocumented immigrant a priority for deportation, as opposed to President Obama’s prioritization of immigrants who had committed serious crimes., Jeannie Kain of Ramirez &amp; Kain, based in Boston, discussed how the new priorities memo has completely changed the advice she offers to her clients., Kain spoke of client of hers who has had previous deportation proceedings but is now married to a U.S. citizen. Typically, this would be a clear-cut case for an application for legal status. But now Kain is unsure of whether to submit this application because it is possible that her client could be arrested at his immigration interview., “Now it’s like all bets are off,” said Kain. “It’s been pretty grim after the inauguration unfortunately.”, , Now, as the first “DREAMer” has been deported, despite Trump’s promises that immigrant children would not be targeted, the situation has become more dire., Cameron said he finds himself worrying about his clients late into the night. He refers to some of his clients as “part of the family.”, “I haven’t been able to get that distance that you need, that other attorneys at this point in their careers have managed to achieve, of being able to step back a little and not be so personally invested,” said Cameron., Cameron is not alone in this. The American Immigration Lawyers Association has a New England chapter headquartered in Boston with a tight-knit community of attorneys all experiencing similar issues., “Whether I feel burnt out, it depends on the hour of the day and what’s just happened,” said Amy Wax, who is also an AILA member. “It’s a shift in morale, both among clients but also among immigration lawyers.”, Wax, of the Law Office of Amy M. Wax, spoke about some of the added stresses of being a lawyer or a client in Boston., With 16,000 pending cases in the immigration courts, Boston has the ninth-highest backlog of cases in the country. According to WBUR, the average wait time to have a case heard is almost two years. Massachusetts has an immigration rate that is twice the national average., Wax said oftentimes when you do get a hearing scheduled the judge has been either double or triple booked for the same time slot, which can lead to clients and lawyers coming prepared to court, witnesses and all, only to be told that their case won’t actually be heard., “If the case isn’t super strong, then sometimes the client is happy that it’s taking a little bit longer,” said Wax. “But I think it increases the anxiety.”, Kain added that this long wait time could be particularly detrimental to asylum cases., “Asylum is a status that’s based on current events,” said Kain. “If you file an asylum case today, if you don’t get heard for three years its possible that the situation has completely changed.”, She added that this also leaves people who had strong asylum cases vulnerable because their application leaves them at the attention of immigration enforcement. This is a recurring worry that each of the attorneys echoed. Applying for legal status in a time of uncertainty can be important, but it can also draw unwanted attention to immigrants with weaker cases., Kain said the only other time in her career that she has seen this level of panic amongst immigrants was directly after the September 11 attacks., “I just hope that something changes. It’s been really horrible, honestly. It’s hard to believe that things could change as quickly as they did, and of course that’s what he said was going to happen,” said Kain. “We were all sort of terrified that that’s what was going to happen and now we’re in it but whatever we’ll work through it.”, That same message of good intentions met with frustrations was echoed by Cameron, who said he wasn’t sure how much longer he could keep doing full-time deportation defense, especially not without mental-health support., “I knew that I wanted to go to law school to do something that would individually help people, to work one on one to make people’s lives better,” said Cameron. “Money didn’t have anything to do with it, and it still doesn’t.”, This multimedia story was produced as part of WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy's class in Digital Storytelling and Social Media at Northeastern University.]"

They work full time and nurture big ambitions. Azi wants to go to law school and open a consulting firm. Derenoncourt is an aspiring politician who's running for City Council At-Large in Brockton. Yet, there’s a critical difference — Derenoncourt’s father is a U.S. citizen, and last year Derenoncourt became a citizen, too., “I’ve been fortunate to be able to be in a different situation than Kenny,” said Derenoncourt., Azi is here under Temporary Protected Status. The acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has indicated that conditions in Haiti have improved enough to end protective status for Haitians., , Azi tells a different story. His family still lives in Haiti, which since the earthquake, has been hit with a cholera epidemic, Hurricane Mathew and widespread hunger. Azi says rather than opening a law firm, he’d be seeking basic survival if he moved back., “The condition of life down there is terrible,” said Azi.  “We’re optimistic that things will eventually change, but as of right now, it is not an option.”, Azi says the stress of worrying about this TPS status is constant. He’s not alone. There are about 4,000 Haitians living in Massachusetts under TPS. Many, like Azi, are well established with jobs, homes and families.,  “There’s a lot of TPS holders who have children, American children,” said state Sen. Linda Dorcena Forry. “So you have a situation where if the parents get sent back to Haiti, who’s going to take care of that child?”, Forry points out that in states with significant Haitian populations – Massachusetts, New York and Florida – congressional representatives have made a bi-partisan push to renew TPS. She hopes it will prompt the Trump administration to honor a promise candidate Trump made: to champion the Haitian community.  , “So here’s a president who rallied and convinced – not all Haitians, because I’m Haitian-American – but Florida, in particular, that he would support Haitian families,” said Forry. “This is what we’re getting, but we’ve got to be hopeful.”, The deadline to renew TPS for Haitians, or let it expire, is May 23., Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

Learning disabilities coupled with a tendency to act out — she stole a bus at the age of thirteen — all but eliminated Lynch’s chances at traditional academic success. In the kitchen, however, she thrived, and ended up finding employment in the culinary industry, even without ever having eaten at a restaurant herself. “Everything was backwards for me … I did everything backwards,” said Lynch., Now owner of the Barbara Lynch Gruppo, Lynch oversees the operations of a number of acclaimed eateries around Boston. Her journey to this summit, though, was not without obstacles — among them, an apprenticeship with Boston chef Todd English. “I did learn a lot from him, but he’s not the one you want to learn from in terms of being a great leader,” said Lynch, recalling an episode in which a frustrated English poured a plate of spaghetti over her head. Yet another challenge, she found, was finding success in a field that has been known to treat women with hostility. “It’s tough for women in any job, honestly,” said Lynch, “but if you want something bad enough, you just go for it.”, That attitude has netted Lynch plenty of success, namely a spot as the lone chef on TIME Magazine’s 2017 list of 100 Most Influential People and the sale of the television rights to ""Out of Line."" Asked if her head swells as a result, the South Boston native, echoing her mother’s counsel, responded, “you’re fancy for, like, one minute, and then back.”,  ]"

977,[How Underage Marriage Puts Girls At Risk],"[Is age 14 too young to get married?, Right now in Massachusetts, there's no law against it., Six 14-year-old girls were married in the state between the years 2000 and 2008. That's according to the non-profit advocacy group Unchained at Last, which has been poring over state records. The group also held a rally at the state house Thursday., Unchained at Last also found that from 2000 to 2014, in Massachusetts, more than a 1,000 kids age 14 to 17 got married. Massachusetts is among a growing number of states with legislation pending to stop child marriages., , Donna Pollard is one of just a few willing to tell her story. She is now in her 30s and lives in Louisville, Ky. She said back when she became a rebellious teenager, her mother sent her away to a mental health facility. It was there that she met her future husband, a counselor. She was 14, and he was more than twice her age. , ""He was very flirtatious,"" said Pollard. ""I would be in the cafeteria with him and he would position himself behind me very close and brush against me or bump into me, and then I would turn around and he would smile. I mean, he was very flirtatious.""   Those flirtations continued for the five weeks she was there. Afterward, she was sent home to her mother. , ""He called me the very next day and he professed his love for me and we talked about how we could make the relationship work,"" said Pollard., Pollard said her mother encouraged it., ""She agreed to start taking me up, meeting him halfway between our residences on weekends to spend time with him,"" said Pollard. ""She would leave me alone with him for hours."" , Pollard said she quickly lost her virginity. She was still 14 and he had turned 30. When he visited, they slept together in her bed with her mother asleep in the next room.   ""She (my mother) saw it as the ability to have someone that could control me and keep my behavior in line, because visiting him was basically an incentive for me not to rebel against her,"" said Pollard., Pollard said this went on for over a year. But whose idea was it then, to get married?, ""I thought that it was mine at the time,"" said Pollard. ""But he had conditioned me to believe that his affection was what defined my self-worth. I thought all I needed was him.  And so, when he mentioned getting married, I jumped at the opportunity."", So Pollard — with her mother along to give legal consent — and this man, went to the clerk's office to get a marriage license.   ""When we walked in, the clerk wouldn't even look at me,"" said Pollard. ""I remember feeling extremely uncomfortable. I think once I realized what was really happening, I wanted someone to speak up or at least question."", Fraidy Reiss, founder of Unchained at Last, said the clerk doesn't have authority to intervene., , Reiss and the organization are working to end childhood marriage one state at a time.   ""We've actually heard stories from other states where a girl has shown up at the clerk's office sobbing while her parents forced her into a marriage,"" said Reiss.   According to Reiss, the states with the most underage marriages are Idaho, Kentucky and Arkansas, but there's no typical profile for these girls; they're from rural and urban areas and from a variety of religions. Some are married off to control their sexuality, for fear she'll get pregnant, or already is pregnant. There are arranged marriages, often to older men to keep a girl from straying from a cloistered community. Some girls are new immigrants, while others are from families that have been here for generations., ,    Massachusetts, like most states, does have a minimum marriage age of 18. But every state allows exceptions. When those exceptions are made, more than half the states — 27 including Massachusetts — have had no minimum age limit at all. This was news to State Representative Kay Khan., ""Well, quite honestly, I was shocked,"" said Khan. ""I thought, 'Oh, Really? Here in Massachusetts?' It was actually a surprise to me, and I find that when I mention it to other people, they also are quite surprised.""   Khan is pushing a bill to have Massachusetts join other states in setting a strict age limit of 18 with no exceptions. Meanwhile, she's working with judges who have to approve these marriages and with police and social services who might come into contract with vulnerable girls like Donna Pollard., Pollard said the abuse started as soon as the marriage did., She remembers several times the police coming, but speaking only to her husband who gave reassurances that everything was OK., ""The police never questioned it further,"" said Pollard. ""They had to see me and know that I was young, and underage. But they never questioned me about 'Are you OK? Are you being abused?'"", Even if the police had removed her, she would likely have been returned her to her mother, who would likely have turned her over to her husband., , ""So essentially, I was trapped,"" said Pollard. ""I had no legal rights as a married minor."", Pollard was in a legal limbo where she was neither a child nor an adult. , She should have been in 10th grade, but like most, she dropped out of school when she married. She got a minimum wage job at a grocery store. As the abuse worsened, she saved up her money and with a pay stub in hand, tried more than once to leave., ""There were a couple of times when I did go to apartment complexes and try to rent an apartment on my own,"" said Pollard.  ""And the people ... told me 'no' because I was not yet 18, and they said I could not legally enter into a contract with them.""   Being married cuts a child off from protective services. They may refer a girl to a shelter, but battered women’s shelters generally are open only to women over 18. Pollard was on her own. She remembers going numb to endure the abuse. By then, Pollard had a baby daughter. , ""The final straw for me was when she (my daughter) was witnessing her father choke me and she began laughing because of course she's ... a baby,"" said Pollard. ""She doesn't know that this is violent. In her mind, we were playing. And I realized at that point that if I stayed and I let this continue, she would end up growing up thinking that this type of behavior was OK."", By now, Pollard was over age 18, which is the age of legal consent. She was literally set free.   ""I was able to get my own place,"" said Pollard. ""I could actually enter into a contract agreement with a person who had an apartment that he rented to me. And I was able to actually file for my own divorce."", Pollard said she is speaking out so that other young girls don't have to go through what she did., Representative Khan's bill to prevent child marriage is winding it's way through the Massachusetts State House., Click on the audio player above to listen to the full story., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

979,[Betsy DeVos' Commencement Speech Sparks Protests],"[Students at Bethune-Cookman University in Florida protested during Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos’ commencement address yesterday., Bethune-Cookman is a historically black university, and DeVos’ and the Trump administration’s complicated relationship to HBCUs cast a shadow over her speech., “She's way off the reservation in her observations about history and it has consequences,” said former Massachusetts education secretary Paul Reville. “People don’t forget.”, DeVos made headlines earlier this year when she said that HBCUs were “pioneers” of the school choice movement, when in reality, black students were being shut out of other institutions after the Civil War and attended them out of necessity., “There are consequences for incompetency,” said Reville of the protests and jeers during her speech., He said the president of the University’s choice to have her as the commencement speaker was “perfectly legitimate,” but students are also entitled to express their opinions about her past remarks., , “I think this president was probably assuming, ‘Well, forgive and forget. My students will be happy to have a leading national figure as their graduation speaker; this is prestigious’ and so forth, but the students have a deeper memory,” he said. “[They] were injured by those comments and wanted to express their dissatisfaction.”, Reville also speculated some of the student response might have been a result of the Trump administration’s shaky endorsement of federal funds for HBCUs., The president implied a federal program that helps finance construction projects for HBCUs might not be constitutional last week. He then walked back the statement., “The administration appears to have retreated on that [budgetary matter], but that’s a real and present threat to those institutions which historically have been precarious financially,” he said. “There are lots of reasons for the students to take that position.”, Paul Reville is a professor at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education where he also runs the Education Redesign Lab.  He was also the Secretary of Education for Massachusetts.

980,[Andrea Cabral Says Targeting Immigrant Crimes May Be A Bad Move ],"[The man accused of murdering two engaged South Boston doctors is now facing questions of deportation., Boston Police confirmed that the suspect, Bampumin Texiera, had committed two previous crimes and is in the United States illegally. Following the release of this information were outcries of deportation., Former Suffolk County Sheriff Andrea Cabral joined Margery Eagan and Jim Braude on Boston Public Radio to discuss the issue., Cabral referenced her time as a prosecutor and how standards on immigrant crime deportation may have changed., “When I was a prosecutor, the Feds had to show two crimes of moral turpitude. That was the standard. It didn’t matter so much between misdemeanor or felony, if the crime was a crime of moral turpitude. You could argue, aside from traffic violations, most crimes are crimes of moral turpitude,"" Cabral said. , Cabral also noted that cases such as this are not as easy to prosecute as they may seem., , “There’s a reason they say hard cases make bad law. I am not defending this particular defendant or any of the horrible things he did, but hard cases do make bad law. Put Texiera aside and anyone else who has gotten a sentence of 364 days and people react differently to different types of crimes. Then you’re saying everybody should be deported,” Cabral said. , Cabral further alluded that to target immigrants like this may create larger problems for communities in the future., “The bottom line is that you just don’t know. And unless you are willing to target whole populations and not just immigrants on some of this stuff as to how you're going to proceed just on the off chance that someone who commits a crime once might be inclined to commit a more serious crime, then you end up essentially with a police state,” Cabral said.  , Police have established that the suspect and the couple had no personal relationship and are still determining if the parties had any prior contact before the killings., Dr. Lina Bolanos worked as a pediatric anesthesiologist at Mass. Eye and Ear while Dr. Richard S. Field was a doctor at the North Shore Pain Management.

982,[How Hampden County Is Working To Prevent Inmate Suicides],"[Amidst the ear-splitting sound of grinding metal, plumes of orange sparks fly around three inmates armed with blowtorches and sanders in the vocational shop at Hampden County Jail. It doesn’t look like it at first, but the point of all this welding is to prevent inmate suicides., , Inmate-welders under the watchful eye of teacher Angel Strada are retrofitting 2,000 steel bed frames, filling in golf-ball sized holes that could be used for tying down a make-shift noose., “A lot is involved in making those beds,” said Strada., Refitting old beds is just part of the anti-suicide effort in Hampden County.  The jail is also putting up posters and distributing pamphlets to new inmates. They want inmates to keep their ears open, and to take seriously any mention of suicide and report it to officers., Hampden County’s efforts to reduce suicide among inmates come as many counties across the state are witnessing an increase in suicides. Since 2006, at least 65 inmates have killed themselves in county-run jails, more than double the number than in state prisons, even though both systems each house roughly 10,000 inmates., , Critics are calling for more state oversight of county sheriffs who run the jails and for more equity in how they’re funded by the state. Watchdogs like Prisoner Legal Services believe some lessons could be learned from the state prisons that have seen inmate suicides drop., In Hampden County’s jail, three inmates have killed themselves in the last five years, which is half the number of inmate suicides in Essex, Suffolk and Worcester County jails for the same time period., Donna Bernardi-Agnes, the clinical director in Hampden County, said jail officials created pamphlets to raise awareness after their investigation into a recent suicide revealed that the inmate had previously shared his suicidal thoughts with another inmate., One of the warning signs highlighted in Hampden County’s pamphlet is hopelessness. The jail fights that problem with job training for inmates., “As people are getting educated and trained, they feel more hopeful [that] maybe they can make a difference, and so that alone is decreasing a risk factor,” said Bernardi-Agnes., Bill Champagne, a jail superintendent, said the training builds inmates’ confidence., “It just changes the game and now they feel they can go out and do things they thought they couldn’t do,” he said., Inmate Edwin Nuñez is learning how to sew green prison uniforms, mattresses and laundry bags and upholster furniture. He can knock out more than 60 shirts in a day. And he’s confident these new skills could lead to a job when he’s released., “They teach us everything in there, step by step from the beginning to the end, everything.  If you don’t got experience, we learn in here,” he said., Hampden is not the only county jail in Massachusetts to offer job training to inmates, but it is one of only two counties in the state that runs its own mental health program, instead of contracting with a for-profit provider. They have ten full-time mental health clinicians for about 1,400 inmates, more than triple the mental health staffing of other similar-sized county jails., That’s where Hampden County’s sheriff wants to spend money. But many sheriffs have complained they’re overwhelmed with mentally ill inmates., , Lindsay Hayes, a national expert on jail suicides, said sheriffs need to face reality., “Sheriffs need to stop complaining about being the largest mental health provider and start acting like it, by getting the resources they need and knocking on doors and publicizing it and working harder,” he said. “They’re operating on a funding cycle that is probably ten to 15 years old.”, County jails are funded with state taxpayer dollars. But county jail budgets in the state are a hodgepodge, according to a 2016 state analysis of sheriff’s funding. It costs one county $34,000 a year to house an inmate, while another county spends double that., Critics like Prisoner Legal Services in Boston, which has filed numerous lawsuits against county jails and state prisons, say the county jails have too much latitude., “There is no oversight in Massachusetts of the Department of Correction or the houses of correction. And the houses of the jails need it even more in many ways,” said Leslie Walker, director of the prisoner advocacy organization. “And the sheriffs, if they don’t feel like talking to us, they don’t have to. They report to the voters every six years.”, Walker would like to see a state agency hold sheriffs to one standard at the county jails – which is especially critical when it comes to mental health, she says., “Why is it fair for someone with bipolar treated decently in prison in Hampden and not in Bristol?” she said. “Where you live shouldn’t determine the mental health care you receive.”, , James Pingeon, also an attorney at Prisoner Legal Services, wants county jails to emulate state prisons, which have decreased suicides in recent years by building special housing for troubled inmates that allows more therapy and socializing., But one other possible solution to inmate suicides doesn’t rely on therapy. It relies on technology., Jail psychiatrist Jorge Veliz is trying to stop those inmates who never give any sign of being suicidal., Veliz runs the for-profit health company Correctional Psychiatric Services, which has contracts with five county jails. He said his company is working on an invention that could allow jail workers to rescue an inmate right in the midst of a hanging., The electronic device would be fitted on the ankle of a high-risk inmate, monitoring and transmitting heart rates, similarly to monitors in a hospital., “The pulse rate initially goes sky high and then drops. That measure, at that moment is what we want to capture,” he said.  , That moment is critical. Experts say death by asphyxiation can happen in about seven minutes. Veliz believes he is still years away from perfecting his invention for the marketplace., Until then, some state policymakers are beginning to grapple with the messy underpinnings of a county sheriff system that gets about $600 million a year in state funds, but has no checks and balances and no accountability to the legislature. , The Eye is the online news site of the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, based at WGBH Public Radio and Boston University.

He stopped by the Boston Public Radio studio before working with culinary arts students at Boston University to discuss his earliest memories of food, his friendship with Julia Child, and more. Highlights of the interview are below., On his friendship with Julia Child and their cooking show together, ""I met Julia in the spring of 1960. I came here at the end of 1959. A friend of mine, Helen McCully, was the food editor at House Beautiful. She showed me, 'look, I just received a manuscript of a book here, would you look at it?' So I looked and it was 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking.' I said, 'gee, this is quite good.' The explanation, the detail, the breakdown of recipes, was more than what was done at the time. [Helen] said, 'she's coming next week, let's cook for her — she's a very tall woman with a terrible voice.' ..., ""People don't realize we had no recipes in those shows. It's unconventional because, conventionally, you come at least with a manuscript of the book. ... But there we decided the week before: okay, we'll do stew, we'll do whatever. Sometimes we changed [our plan] the night before. So there was no recipe!"" , On the food he remembers from his childhood growing up in France during World War Two, ""During the war in France, food was pretty scarce. My father left to [join] the Resistance. My mother was a waitress in a restaurant. She had three boys to feed. So during the summer vacation, we were going to school already, and they put me on a farm about twenty, thirty miles from where we lived. I remember going there with my mother, sitting on the handlebars of her bicycle. At the time she used to go to those farms to try to get food. They left me there with the farmer. I was six years old. I was pretty sad. The farmer's wife took my hand and took me to the barn when my mother left. It was the first time I was that close to a cow. She put my hand on the teats of the cow to push down, and milk came out. That's when I had my first glass of lukewarm milk. It was a Proustian moment and changed my life."", On the economical way his mother cooked , ""I'm miserly in the kitchen, and it's probably because of her. When we were kids, before going to school, my two brothers and I would go to the market with my mother in the morning. She had a little restaurant...There was no car, so we walked to the market—about half a mile away—and she bought, on the way back, a case of mushrooms which was getting dark so she knew the guy had to sell it, so she'd try to get it for half price. ... She didn't have a refrigerator. She had an ice box: that's a block of ice in a cabinet. In there she'd have a couple of chickens or meat for the day. It had to be finished at the end of the day because she couldn't keep it. And the day after we'd go to the market again. So everything was local, everything was fresh, everything was organic. I always say my mother was an organic gardener, but of course, the word 'organic' did not exist. But chemical fertilizer did not exist either., , On his favorite foods, ""I'm past 80 years old now. When you're a young chef, you tend to add, and to add, and to add to the plate, and to decorate. As you get older you take away, take away, take away from the plate. You'll be left with a tomato at the right temperature, a bit of coarse salt, and a bit of olive oil. You don't want too much embellishment, you know?, ""When people ask me my favorite thing, I say 'bread and butter.' If you have the greatest bread and the greatest butter, it's hard to beat."", On what makes him excited about the future of food, ""The most exciting cooking in the world is probably in America, in my opinion. There are 24,000 restaurants in New York. The amount of ethnicity is unmatched in the world. It's extraordinary...When I came here, any fancy restaurant was a French restaurant. Everything was misspelled on the menu and wasn't really French, but there was no great Italian restaurant, Chinese, Mexican, certainly not Japanese as there is now. Any fancy restaurant was a French restaurant. It's quite different now."", On celebrity chefs and reality TV cooking shows, ""I was somewhere a while ago where there was a food historian, and they were saying there are 405 cooking shows on television. I don't know whether that's accurate, it seems a bit exaggerated to me. But still, maybe 300. It's just amazing. However, a great deal of those are reality TV-type of arguing, fighting, which is not really [what it's like] in a regular kitchen. If you go to Thomas Keller or Daniel Boulud in New York, or even here, Nicki [Hobson] at the Island Creek Oyster Bar, you will see in the kitchen—if the camera comes—everything is quiet. It's like a ballet. ..., ""You cannot really cook indifferently.

988,[Is Boston’s Back Bay Parking Experiment Working?],"[These days, twenty-five cents will buy you exactly four minutes of on-street parking in the Back Bay. So, I'm going to drop a quarter in the metaphorical meter and invite you to give me four minutes of your time (depending on how quickly you read) so I can share what I learned when I recently hit the streets to find out how the new rates are (or aren't) working for people in the neighborhood. , Back in January, rates at metered spaces tripled from $1.25 to $3.75 an hour as part of a year-long pilot program being run by the mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics. It's an attempt to solve the decades-long problem of parking in the city’s bustling commercial and residential neighborhood. , At one of those kiosks where you pay for parking on Newbury Street, I came across John and his family (he didn’t want to reveal his last name). They were visiting from Connecticut, here to do some shopping and grab an early dinner. Here's what happened:, Me: You know, for two hours it’s going to cost you almost $8 [to park]. How does that strike you? John: It strikes me. It’s a good hit. That’s an outta the park hit, yeah. Me: Too expensive? John: It is very expensive. Me: And yet you drove down here John: I did. Me: Why? John: No choice., As an area resident, Marie Miranda did have a choice. She could have taken the T, grabbed an Uber or a Lyft, even walked from the Public Garden where she told me she had been parked earlier in the day. Still, the convenience of the car for an afternoon of shopping won the day.   , ""It’s really pricey, but I get it,"" said Miranda. ""I think 'cause people just would stay in the same spot for hours, so maybe they’re trying to get people to move. But it is still kind of pricey."", Miranda is spot on. Getting people to move their cars is exactly why the city is experimenting with higher prices., ""What we’re trying to do is figure out how to better manage our limited supply of curbside parking opportunities,"" said Ilona Kramer, program director in Mayor Marty Walsh's Office of New Urban Mechanics., The theory is that higher prices will incentivize people to consider shorter stays, public transportation, or a nearby garage, thereby creating more open spaces on the street., ""Our goal is that, on average, there would be one space open per block,"" said Kramer. ""So that you, as a driver, when you’re looking for a space, you have a high probability of finding one on your first pass on the street."", , The city has been monitoring and collecting data in the Back Bay for months, and progress report is expected in June once the numbers are statistically significant. In the meantime..., ""Anecdotally, we are hearing that it is working,"" said Kramer. ""[We're hearing] that It’s easier to find spaces, that there are fewer cars double parking, and fewer cars illegally parked."", In fact, it’s working too well if you ask Michele Messino from the Newbury Street League, an organization that represents more than 300 Back Bay businesses. She says there are too many open spaces these days on Newbury and Boylston. As evidence, she pointed to the dozens of letters she’s received from area businesses — from high end clothing stores to salons, co-working spaces to restaurants — that say parking prices are driving customers away., ""It’s kind of cutting out that experience of 'an afternoon on Newbury Street',” said Messino. ""And that’s not — I don’t think — what this is meant to do."", Messino wants the city to drop the price down to $2.50 an hour for the remainder of the year-long pilot program., Vicki Smith, with the Neighborhood Association of the Back Bay isn’t advocating for that, but she does want to see a more holistic approach. As we walked the neighborhood streets she drew my attention to the kinds of vehicles taking up many of the metered spaces: work vehicles., ""Electricians, mechanical,"" said Smith. ""They’re clearly here working. And they’re not residents, and they’re not shopping."", During the day, Smith says, there are actually plenty of open parking spaces on the Back Bay streets — not at meters — but in the significant stretches reserved for residents only. Her idea? Visitor parking permits, like they have in Cambridge and Somerville., Smith says that if day workers could park in residential areas, it would free up all kinds of spaces at the meters — and cut costs for everyone.  , ""For cleaning people, for babysitters, for plumbers, it would be a huge benefit to be able to have a visitor space,"" said Smith. , As if on cue, Smith and I ran into Angel Gonzalez, who was dropping a few more quarters in the meter. He’s an exterminator who says he’s worked the Back Bay for decades. And he’s been feeling the pinch:, Gonzalez: It’s too much. Me: $3.75 an hour is too much? Gonzalez: Yeah it’s too much, too much for $15 an hour. Me: You make $15 an hour? Gonzalez: Yeah. Me: And $3.75 of that is now going to parking? Gonzalez: Too much., All this is just the tip of the iceberg. What about more loading zones for delivery trucks? Are the higher prices impacting the city’s revenue? Will area garages raise their prices if the new rates are kept long term? Those questions will have to be left for a later date. We're out of time. I've gotta go feed the meter. , Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"
989,[Brockton School Serves Breakfast In Class To Improve Students' Performance],"[Every day at 9 a.m., students wheel coolers of food into each classroom at Mary E. Baker School in Brockton., For 8-year-old Jonalyce Hampton-Roderick, it’s a highlight of the day. She loves the food. What does she eat?, ""A banana muffin, an apple, a cheese stick and apple juice,"" she said. ""I feel like I have more energy to get through the rest of my day.”, The in-class meal is part of an initiative appropriately called Breakfast After the Bell. It was created to get students who are eligible for free lunch to also take advantage of free breakfast. At the Baker school, that includes more than 700 students., Andrea Silbert with the Eos Foundation, an organization that works to address hunger and poverty issues, says having everyone eat together takes away the stigma that free breakfast is just for low income students. To make it happen, the Eos Foundation gives one-time $10,000 grants to school districts that participate in Breakfast After the Bell. Silbert says Brockton, New Bedford and Lowell got high marks for participation., “This year we piloted a report card to compare districts and schools that have 60 percent or higher free and reduced [meal students], so these are schools with high poverty, and Brockton came in third in the state in terms of the percentage of children eating breakfast,"" Silbert said., , According to the The National School Lunch Program, children at poverty level — which is just over $20,000 a year for a family of four — are eligible for free meals. Students from families earning just over $30,000 a year for a family of four are eligible for reduced-price meals, and can’t be charged any more than 40 cents., In Brockton, more than 80 percent of students qualify for free breakfast and lunch. But Baker School Principal Valerie Brower says not as many were taking advantage of breakfast., “The children had a choice before,"" Brower said. ""They could play outside for a few minutes or they could come and eat breakfast. They chose to play outside. That wasn’t always the best choice.”, Brower says those choices landed students in the nurse’s office so often that she would stock the nurse’s office with crackers and apples., , Four years after launching Breakfast After the Bell, Brockton Public Schools Superindent Kathleen Smith says it has made a difference; even grades have improved., “They’re completely focused, less visits to the nurses, and what I am most impressed with is that many times there’s an opportunity for them all to have a snack a little later in the morning from their breakfast,"" Smith said., It has made breakfast a classroom routine for students like Hampton-Roderick., “If I am in a rush in the morning then I can come to school and eat breakfast,"" she said., WGBH’s coverage of K-12 education is made possible with support from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"
990,"[County Jails Have Turned Into Psychiatric Hospitals, Sheriffs Say]","[At the Worcester County jail, correctional officers all carry a small metal tool that’s shaped like a J., The inside curve of this tool is razor sharp, and its purpose is grim – meant for slicing through a handmade noose to bring down the body of an inmate who has tried to commit -- or who has committed – suicide., “Unfortunately, I’ve been involved with numerous suicides in the institution,” said Captain Kevin Vanarsdalen, an officer at the Worcester County House of Correction who has personally seen eight inmate suicides in 25 years. “Probably three of those, I actually used the tool myself,” he said., Since 2006, eight inmates have killed themselves inside Worcester County Jail.  In that same time period, at least 65 men and women held in county-run jails statewide have taken their own lives., The officers’ cut-down tools may be the last line of defense against a completed suicide, but they’re often too late. Death by asphyxiation happens in about seven minutes., , Officers like Vanarsdalen hope they never have to use that tool. More often, they turn to suicide watch cells as the default defense against inmate suicides., , In Worcester County, that’s Unit A-1 -- the high-risk tier. Sliding steel doors painted battleship grey each have a window the size of a sheet of paper. The 16 cells are suicide-proofed: nothing to tie a noose to and no materials to make one., Inmates on this unit are stripped naked and given a one-piece smock, made of green, quilted material that can’t tear., “A lot of guys come in and complain, they’re not allowed socks or underwear,” said officer Ryan Gasco, who works on A-1. “It’s not to embarrass them. It’s for their safety.”, Jail officials see suicide watch as an extreme but necessary measure to make sure an inmate can’t harm himself or herself., Former inmates see it differently., “You’re put into what they call a ‘Barney Rubble suit.’ They strip you naked, you’re put in this harm reducing outfit and put in a cell with a light turned on 24 hours a day,” said Michael Earielo, who served time at the Worcester County jail in 2013 and now runs a drop-in center in downtown Worcester offering peer recovery for addicts., , Earielo views the suicide watch practice as a harsh response with a dangerous backlash., “How is it possible for me to say I need help when you’re actually going to give me torture?, It frightens people to even ask for help, knowing the condition they provide,” he said., Inmates could spend days, or even weeks in suicide watch, and it’s up to the jail’s mental health staff to decide when an inmate can be released from the watch cell., A federal investigation in 2008 called the property restrictions and lockdown rules at Worcester County Jail draconian. Investigators also concluded that the harsh conditions there would just make an inmate’s mental health problems worse., , “They’re locked down so they don’t get showers, they don’t get visits, they don’t get phone calls. They get finger foods,” said Lindsay Hayes, a national expert on suicide prevention in jails and prisons. “You’re not going get a very honest response from an inmate when you’re subjected to those conditions.”, Hayes is a firm believer in counseling inmates while on suicide watch and argues that county jails often fall woefully short., “They see mental health once a day and normally not outside the cell,” said Hayes. “Usually, mental health comes in, there’s a food port that is in front of the cell, the food port door opens, the clinician leans down, and looks at the inmate, and says, ‘Are you suicidal today? How ya feelin’?’ And of course, if I was in that situation, I’d say, I’m feelin’ really good, doc, can I please get out of this cell and off the suicide watch?”, But what choice do jails have when confronted with a suicidal inmate? Jorge Veliz is a jail psychiatrist, whose for-profit company has millions of dollars of contracts with five county sheriffs in the state: Barnstable, Bristol, Middlesex, Norfolk and Plymouth., Veliz sees the harshness of suicide watch, but doesn’t have a better option yet., “It looks at times inhumane to put somebody who is saying ‘look, I am depressed, I want to kill myself,’ …  in a room with that single cloth, unable to rip apart,” said Veliz. “It feels at times like it’s not fair for that person. Do we have anything better?  I don’t know because every place in the world is about the same.”, The Justice Department called on Worcester County to build a special needs unit to house its mentally ill inmates in less harsh conditions. The county is building a new unit – at a cost of $24 million – but it will replace a crumbling medical building. And the suicide watch cells on A-1 will remain., The Eye is the online news site of the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, based at WGBH Public Radio and Boston University.

995,[Why Is The Suicide Rate In Bristol County Jails So High?],"[With jail suicide numbers as high as Bristol County’s, you might think Sheriff Thomas Hodgson would have hit the panic button or declared a crisis., You’d be wrong.         , “Statistics can certainly be looked at from every which way to Tuesday,” said Hodgson in a recent interview., But it’s hard to look at county statistics and not see a sharp contrast between Bristol and other urban counties in Massachusetts. Since 2006, Bristol has had 50 percent more suicides than Suffolk County and more than twice as many as Essex and Worcester., Bristol County’s jail in North Dartmouth operates at 300 percent of design capacity, according to a report just released by the State Executive Office of Public Safety. Experts say overcrowded jails can set the stage for suicide, increasing stress on inmates and correctional officers., Hodgson, who is outspoken on hardline policies such as offering up his inmates to help build President Trump’s border wall, said overcrowding is not the problem. He blamed high suicide numbers on social problems, especially the opioid addiction crisis in his county., “We’re one of those counties with cities that have very, very serious problems with regards to drug use and lack of structure for families and kids,” said Hodgson., But the sheriff doesn’t actually know how many of the recent inmates who killed themselves were drug addicts or in detox. His jail doesn’t track that., , Bristol County’s jail superintendent Steven Souza, a 30-year veteran in corrections, contends there’s no foolproof way to prevent jail suicides. And he says you can’t always trust the inmates who talk about it., “Inmates will threaten suicide because they want to get to the medical unit with air conditioning. You have to determine the threat level,” he said, during a recent tour of the jail in North Dartmouth. “If I were to put them on watch, then let them have everything, what purpose does it serve?”, Souza is similarly skeptical about defendants and inmates in a courtroom who make threats about suicide. Sometimes those threats are just aimed at pressuring family members to bail them out, said Souza., But Bristol County Jail has faced sharp criticism that it ignores official warnings from local courts about inmates at immediate risk of suicide., Two years ago, a judge warned Bristol County Jail to keep a close watch on Brandon St. Pierre, after the 32-year-old told a court psychologist of his desire to kill himself., “The doctor took it seriously. The judge took it seriously. I took it seriously,” said Nicolas Gordon, St. Pierre’s defense attorney. “Nothing was done to protect this young man.”, The judge gave St. Pierre a Q5 classification, meaning high-risk for suicide. But the day after returning to Bristol’s jail from court, he got into fight.  He was sent to a segregated unit, a solo cell used to discipline inmates., They’re locked down for 23 hours a day. Meals are slid through a small slot in the cell door. That’s where St. Pierre hanged himself., The danger of segregation is that it’s where more than half of jail suicides happen, said James Pingeon, a lawyer at Prisoner Legal Services in Boston., , “That’s one of the problems at Bristol particularly, that they use segregation basically as a management tool for the mentally ill,” he said., Prisoner Legal Services has sued Bristol County twice. And they call Bristol County’s jail a “hell-hole.”, Former inmate Jamal Jones doesn’t go quite that far in his assessment of the jail., But Jones – who was released in January after a 13-month sentence – criticized the thinly-staffed mental health program at the jail and how difficult it was to get help., “They’ve got one counselor to about 100 people. I don’t think they’re addressing it in the right way, I really don’t,” said Jones. “They had a sign-in sheet. If they wanted to see you, you would get seen.”, Bristol County did not respond to a public records request asking for details on its mental health staffing., One counselor for every 100 inmates is double the caseload of some state prisons. Hampden County has 10 full-time mental health clinicians for an average of 1,433 inmates, while Bristol County has three for some 1,350 inmates, according to the Massachusetts Sheriffs’ Association., But Sheriff Hodgson and Superintendent Souza believe their mental health program is doing just fine. In fact, the sheriff said that Jorge Veliz -- the owner of the for-profit company running the program -- was “brilliant.”, Correctional Psychiatric Services is owned by Veliz, a psychiatrist, and has contracts with five county sheriffs in the state. The contract with Bristol County is worth $8.2 million., Veliz shares the viewpoint with Hodgson that it’s hard to predict all suicides., “I’ve been in corrections for 35 years, and it’s very difficult to understand it. Sometimes you talk to a person. He’s totally fine. He tells you nothing is wrong, and he’s happy. And two hours later, he hangs himself,” said Veliz. “There’s no way to explain.”, Hodgson and Souza say if there’s anything that needs changing in their county jail, it’s state funding. They say that other county jails with hundreds fewer inmates get millions of dollars more in state funds than Bristol County., The Eye is the online news site of the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, based at Boston University and WGBH Public Radio.

1000,[Suicides in County Jails Are All Too Common],"[Thirty days. That’s one measly month., For most adults, it flies by., But for Guy Duffy, staring down a 30-day sentence in the Essex County Jail two summers ago, the clock slowed to a crawl., Duffy suffered from depression, his wife Laurie said, and he was a chain-smoker with high blood pressure. He had never been to jail before, a factor known to put inmates at high risk of suicide, especially during their first two weeks behind bars., , “He was scared. That was his first time dealing with this,” said Laurie Duffy, choking back tears. “He wasn’t feeling good. He was just so scared, the poor guy.”, On July 14, 2015, Guy Duffy was found dead in his cell. He had killed himself., Duffy is one of 42 suicides in county jails in Massachusetts since 2012, compared with 18 inmate suicides in state-run prisons, including the recent suicide of former Patriots player Aaron Hernandez. County jails and state prisons each house roughly 10,000 inmates across the system, but counties have seen more than double the inmate suicides., Most county jail inmates are sentenced for low-level offenses like larceny, assault and drug possession. State prisons hold inmates serving time for more serious crimes like murder, rape and drug trafficking., Duffy was 54 years old when he was convicted of animal cruelty. A judge in Lawrence District Court decided Duffy had waited far too long before taking his 16-year-old cat to get euthanized when an infection began eating away at its face., , Given a baggy jumpsuit and shoes that were four sizes too big, the former sign-maker who loved motorcycles and fishing joined 1,066 other inmates inside the drab concrete buildings. Sixteen-foot tall chain-link fences topped with razor wire ring the complex, which sits on a hill in Middleton., Laurie said she tried to reach her husband for six days on a jail phone before actually talking with him. One call costs five dollars and automatically cuts off at 30 minutes. As Duffy struggled with what experts call the “shock of confinement,” those calls became more panicked., “I’m basically calling you to tell you goodbye, ‘cause I’m not gonna make it,” Duffy told his wife in one of those calls – all of them tape-recorded by the jail., His wife pleaded with him to pull it together, but Duffy crumbled., “I can’t pull it together. There’s something wrong with me. I’m cold. I’m sweating. They don’t care. I’m breaking down. I’m having a nervous breakdown,” he said., Duffy also poured out his anguish to social workers employed by the jail’s for-profit mental health provider, NaphCare, a multimillion dollar company based in Alabama., He told them he couldn’t eat. He was losing weight. He was hallucinating, trembling and sweating. All of this was documented in his records., Jail officers and mental health counselors moved Duffy nine times -- from the infirmary, to general population, to suicide watch and a solitary cell, known as segregation, which is used to discipline inmates or protect them from others., After her husband’s sixth move, Laurie got a voice message from the jail that gave her hope., “Several of the case workers did meet with him,” a jail official told Laurie. “He's definitely safe. he's in a good place.”, Four days later, in the middle of the night, Duffy became paranoid. He thought people were trying to kill him, according to reports from jail officers., Duffy had already told a social worker that he didn’t like being in a cell by himself, where he was left alone with his thoughts. But that’s right where the jail ultimately put him -- in a segregated cell, with bed sheets and a laundry hook., “It shouldn't have happened. He was failed at every level, every friggin’ level,” said Laurie Duffy., Laurie Duffy’s outrage and grief elicited no easy answers from Essex County Jail officials. Their own review of Duffy’s suicide left open the question as to why he was moved into a segregated cell with the means to hang himself., Duffy was one of four suicides in 2015 at the Middleton jail, and his death is part of the trend pushing jail inmate suicide rates in Massachusetts 56 percent higher than the national rate for jails., The explanation from newly elected Essex County Sheriff Kevin Coppinger is a common refrain from sheriffs: County jails have become de-facto mental hospitals., “There’s a huge increase in the number of mental health clients that are involved with the criminal justice system,” said Coppinger. “A majority of our inmates here either have substance abuse issues or mental health issues or a combination of both.”, The argument is that inmates arrive in county jails right off the streets -- often with serious opioid addictions and troubled lives., County jails are also processing many more inmates per year than state prisons., “We have 6,200 guys per year come through our door. One of the hardest things about it is you have 6,200 personalities. You have 6,200 issues,” said David Tuttle, superintendent of Worcester County’s jail, which holds about 1,200 inmates. “Everyone is so different.”, Tuttle also believes that no matter what jails do, they can’t always prevent an inmate suicide. It’s a viewpoint shared by Jorge Veliz, whose for-profit company based in Braintree, Correctional Psychiatric Services, has contracts with five county jails in the state., “Sometimes you talk to a person, and he’s totally fine. He tells you nothing is wrong. He’s happy to live, and two hours later he hangs himself. There’s no way to explain,” said Veliz., But Lindsay Hayes, a national expert on prison suicide who lives in Mansfield travels the country challenging just that notion., “That was always the attitude, 100 percent of the time: ‘People who commit suicide never tell us that they’re going to do it. How can you expect us to be fortune tellers? It’s unfortunate, we feel sorry for the family.’ I heard it consistently all the time,” said Hayes., Hayes has led national studies and reform efforts -- for increased training for jail and prison staff, better psychological screening of inmates, more safely-designed cells., Many suicides are preventable, said Hayes. And that’s why he argues that jails must learn from each inmate suicide and make changes., “That’s why it’s important. Because it’s someone’s child. It’s someone’s spouse. It’s someone we should be caring about. Putting aside what they might have been accused of or arrested for, or, in some cases convicted of,” he said., Almost two years after her husband’s death, Laurie Duffy is still wishing that someone at Essex County Jail had seen how mentally fragile he was and done something differently., The Eye is the online news site of the New England Center for Investigative Reporting, based at WGBH Public Radio and Boston University.

1011,[FBI's Comey Faces Questions From Senate About October Surprise],"[FBI Director James Comey testified in front of lawmakers today about his October 28 letter that some say helped Donald Trump win the election., Comey took questions during the Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing, defending his decision to notify congress last fall of new emails related to the FBI's investigation of Hillary Clinton., The question of why Comey commented on the investigation into Clinton’s emails but not the one into Trump’s Russia connections remains largely unanswered, but national security expert Juliette Kayyem has a theory., “He thought she was going to win,” Kayyem said on BPR today. “He was worried about this leaking, that the investigation had been reopened for some short period of time, and that the integrity of the FBI would have been put into question.”, , Kayyem said if Clinton had won and voters had found out about the investigation after the election, the FBI “would have been killed.”, “That is the only explanation,” she said, “and it’s a pretty bad one, because your FBI director cannot have feelings about polls, or about himself.”, In October, senior intelligence officials urged Comey not to send the letter to congress, saying the FBI does not confirm ongoing investigations. The FBI director went ahead despite this advice, and he has faced criticism since then, especially today., He said the idea that his letter might have influenced the election makes him “mildly nauseous,” a choice of words that’s triggered negative responses from many intelligence experts, including Kayyem., “Comey needs to open the lens a little bit if he’s going to do some self-reflection,” Kayyem said on BPR today. “It’s always been about what people will think about him and what people will think about the FBI. The reason why we have these rules is because I don’t care if Comey felt nauseous, and no one should care what the FBI director feels.”, Kayyem also pointed out that Comey’s effort to maintain apolitical backfired this election season., “He’s an adult; he knows the FBI is working in an environment in which you’ve got Trump versus Clinton,” she said. “His failure to take in a political moment to see what he was doing, is a political moment.”, Comey said today that “concealment” of the email update to avoid influencing the election would have been the wrong move, and he would repeat his decision to release the letter., Kayyem said Comey’s exceptional treatment of Clinton began long before October 28., “This started in June when he decides he is not going to prosecute Hillary Clinton, and has this press conference that is literally like a campaign speech,” said Kayyem. [Comey] opened it up for himself.”, The FBI director read an unusual statement during the summer about Clinton’s use of a private email system, one that he admitted included “more detail about [the FBI’s] process” than would a normal briefing., Kayyem called this speech “unprecedented.”, Comey claimed today that he treated both Clinton’s and Trump’s investigations “consistently under the same principles.”, Comey said he waited three months before disclosing details of both investigations, but Kayyem said that his October letter’s proximity to the election raises a lot of questions., “Once he violated the rules that you don’t disclose so close to the election, why would you violate them for her and not for him?” asked Kayyem. “There’s no good answer.”, Juliette Kayyem is the host of the SCIF podcast, founder of Kayyem Solutions and a contributor to WGBH and CNN.

Her comments in a Boston Globe series titled ""The Discomfort Zone,"" written by Don Aucoin, caused a firestorm, which she said led to both threats and support from readers. The essence of her comments re-emerged again after comedian Michael Che called Boston ""the most racist city"" he's ever visited and, in response, Globe opinion writer Renee Graham penned two columns titled, ""Yes, Boston, you are racist"" and ""In Boston, less racism is still racism."", , Callie Crossley spoke with Tiffany Dufu about her thoughts on race in Boston and if she feels the city has changed at all since she lived here., Interview highlights, ""My first experiences with Boston were before I moved to Boston, when I was calling to look for an apartment for my husband and I. And I would explain that we were coming because he was going to be a student at MIT Sloan, and what I realized in the course of trying to find an apartment was that people thought I was white, and they would describe the neighborhoods to me in the context of race and advise me to live in some neighborhoods, not other neighborhoods and, of course, I knew nothing of any of these neighborhoods but thought it quite fascinating that they were describing them based on their assumptions about me."" -- Tiffany Dufu on her initial impressions of Boston, ""It's not as if there isn't racism in other cities. Racism is an institution and an experience that exists everywhere in America, let's face it. There are other aspects of the culture here that I think, in some ways, make it more prominent -- a sense of tribalism that, for example, you don't have in New York. When people ask me, ""Where are you from?"" and I'm in New York, I say, ""I'm from Seattle."" And if it's a New Yorker, they'll say, ""Oh but I've seen you around. How long have you been here?"" And I'll say, ""Oh, I've lived here for 12 years,"" and they'll say, ""OK, you can say you're from New York now, Tiffany!"" That's not Boston, right? Unless you're born and bred ... there's a very strong sense of ""us and them,"" of the people who are here who are true, who are real, and the people who are transient, who are the newcomers. And I think that those kinds of dynamics amplify the racism that actually exists anywhere and causes it to manifest in different ways, maybe."" -- Tiffany Dufu on racism in Boston, Tiffany Dufu is the author of ""Drop the Ball: Achieving More By Doing Less.""

We are both impacted, our families are impacted, and our communities are impacted.”,  On Christmas Eve, 1993, Tina Chéry’s 15-year-old son, Louis, was walking to an anti-gang violence meeting when he was caught in the crossfire of a shootout and killed. Four years later, Charles Bogues pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in Louis’ killing and ultimately served 16 years in prison.,  Chéry founded the Louis D.

But she also took another extraordinary step—reaching out to the mother of the man who pleaded guilty in the death of her son. “I really wanted to know who this mother was,” said Chéry, “because it could have been my son on the other end of that.”,  In time, she went on to form a relationship with Bogues as well, even visiting him in prison. “Before he came out [of prison], I wanted to meet him… I did not want him to come out and end up dead himself or in prison for killing someone else.”,  “Part of me was a little bit afraid of what reaction I would get,” said Bogues, recalling the anticipation of his first conversation with Chéry. “Her graciousness to me… getting that opportunity to apologize for my actions and just the feeling of love that she extended to me… it felt like I finally got to do something I wanted to do a long time.”,  “We are all impacted when violence happens. It's not just the individual,” said Chéry of her decision to meet with Bogues. “We pay our dues to society and that's what we call justice. That's man's justice for me. I feel that by extending my hand and my heart for forgiveness, that is God’s justice…. It is a part of my inner healing.”,  Last year, Chéry and Bogues stood side by side at the 20th annual Mother’s Day Peace Walk in Boston to share their stories. “For us, this is transforming the way society responds to homicide,"" said Chéry. ""How do we engage the families of those that are pulling the trigger? How do we make sure that they are connected?” she asked, adding that she is encouraged by the changes the city has made in how it treats homicide cases, including the new trauma response team and Governor Baker addressing the issue of city violence in his State of the Commonwealth.,  Bogues has now been out of prison for three years and, in addition to his involvement with the Louis D. Brown Peace Institute, he works with the Massachusetts Community Outreach Initiative, talking to kids about his experiences and where they lead him—including Chéry’s forgiveness and how it has affected his life. “I know that I have a debt that I owe to the Chéry family and to society,"" Bogues said, ""had she not reached out her hand to me, I don't think my thinking would have been different, but it wouldn't have been as urgent.”]"

""Dean"" won the Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Tribeca Film Festival and opens June 2 in limited release. , Martin joined Boston Public Radio to discuss the film and his career in comedy. Some highlights are below., On his directorial debut, ""Dean"", ""While it is a comedy, I try to deal with some real emotional things that I had been through. It’s a comedy about loss. Kevin Kline plays my father, I was very lucky to get him. It’s about two guys getting over the loss of the same person — my character’s mom. I’d say she has passed away maybe a year before this movie takes place. So while it is about grief, it’s really about coming out of grief or at least trying to come out of it."", On how ""Dean"" was inspired by his own life, ""When I was 20, my dad passed away. He was 46. He was really young. It’s been awhile, it’s been about 23 years. I thought there’d be an interesting story to tell in father and son going through the same thing, in a sense, in approaching grief from different angles. But if they both met someone along the way — if I could tell parallel but different stories while the two guys were having trouble communicating — I thought that would be an interesting story."", , On including his own cartoons in the film, ""I put so much work into the drawings! I’m not a technically great artist, but what I love about drawing is kind of what I love about one-liners. With just a few words or just a few lines, you can convey ideas that sometimes can be pretty rich. I love that about it."", On dropping out of law school to become a comedian, ""I wanted to go to law school since about seventh grade. I remember 'L.A. Law' was a popular show when I was a kid, and my parents loved that show. I think that imprinted on me: 'oh, I could do this.' I'm sure I sought approval — I know I did, because I still do. I'm a comedian. That's all I do. Every 30 seconds I'm looking for it., I went to college with that in mind, went straight to law school after college. Then, suddenly — a month, two months into the first year — I had the crisis where I realized, 'oh no, this isn't for me.' The first year of law school is stimulating, but there's that core curriculum and you're with your section, with your group. They have assigned seats when I was there: you sit down, and they do a seating chart, and that's where you sit every day. It's very regimented. I had my crisis. When I left, everybody disapproved. It was terrible. But I was in New York. There were comedy club everywhere. It was almost easy to step into a world that was right next to me..., There was a place called the Boston Comedy Club in the Village, across the street from the NYU Law School ... It was there, gnawing at me, and I thought, 'I want to try this. I got to try this.' I had never done it. In fact, I dropped out before my first set on stage."" , , On how his father's career as a Greek Orthodox priest taught him to love performing, ""I grew up in the Greek Orthodox church — I'd say I'm agnostic at best now, I'm not heavy into this stuff. The service was mostly in archaic Greek, and you're a kid, you don't know what they're saying. It's a dramatic show. My dad had a cape on, there's a thing with incense. There's theater to it. It's like a show. Then at the end, he closes with a 20-minute set. There was no script. He just spoke extemporaneously.

In both countries, anti-immigrant sentiment, partly motivated by local economic stagnation, has strengthened the far-right., “We ought to pay attention to this strange moment we live in, where populist nationalist sentiment speaks very powerfully to many people in the world,” Sennott said. “Fear of immigrants sells, and the policies of nationalism sell, particularly when the forces of globalism are changing our lives in such profound ways.”, Sennott said he’s reminded of the American presidential election, and a recent trip to Appalachia makes him even more reticent to make a prediction for France., “In Kentucky and West Virginia, driving through some parts of our country and looking at just how bad it really is, is eye opening,” he said “There are a lot of those faded industrial economies in the UK and France and in the United States, and fear sells.”, Charlie Sennott is a news analyst at WGBH, where he also heads up The GroundTruth Project.

Here, the ""Fall of Saigon"" is a day of collective mourning., Dorchester Avenue is jammed with traffic and lined with bodegas. On the sidewalk, Khang Nguyen leads a team of Vietnamese-Americans as they prop up ladders to hang flags of South Vietnam: solid yellow with three red stripes., , They mark the day – April 30th – their country ceased to exist., “That day changed millions and millions of people’s lives – that includes me,” says Nguyen., For Nguyen, the day is seared in his memory. He was seven and living in rural Vietnam., “I heard it on the radio,” he recalls. “My mother was scared.”, What Nguyen learned on the radio 42 years ago – in 1975 – was that tanks of Vietnam’s Communist North had rolled into the capital of South Vietnam ending a decades-long war., In iconic footage, Americans and their allies escaped in helicopters from the roof of the U.S. Embassy. Many South Vietnamese took to the sea and began a long journey away from their homeland. Nguyen’s father was among them., Some of Nguyen’s relatives in Vietnam were sent to prisons called Re-education Camps, where torture was common. And Nguyen was forced to do manual labor at school., He says he has “a lot of bad memories” of being harassed and bullied., At age 13, he fled alone on a boat and – after several years in a prison in Thailand – arrived in Massachusetts. Here, he reunited with his father and became part of the growing Vietnamese community., , Now, Nguyen spearheads the effort to remember the day he lost his country and – along with many of his countrymen – started looking for a new one., “I see a gap between the old generation, my generation and my son’s generation,"" Nguyen says. ""The old generation – they suffered too much.” He wants to make sure the younger generation understands this history, so he insists on having college students born in the United States help hang the flags., Nguyen also helped organized a memorial service where over a hundred of people – young and old – remember together. They sing the national anthem of their fallen country, while hoisting their flag at Boston’s City Hall and laying flowers at the Dorchester Vietnam Veterans Memorial., Nguyen and his community call this event Black April. But not everyone in the Boston area remembers it by that name., “We called it: The Day to Celebrate The Victory Against America,” says Minh Trinh., Trinh is a graduate student at MIT. He grew up in Vietnam, and three of his grandparents were part of the North’s victorious military. As a kid, he marked the holiday by watching military parades and nationalist movies on TV. Red flags with gold stars flew everywhere. , “It’s a huge holiday,” Trinh says. “In some ways it almost feels like Thanksgiving or Christmas.”, Yet in the U.S., Vietnamese students studying abroad often celebrate quietly so as not upset the local community, says Trinh., But Trinh no longer celebrates the day. He says he’s come to understand the atrocities committed during the war and that his life’s privileges have come at the expense of others., “A lot of what I have had today is born on the blood and suffering of the people of the south,” he says., Trinh would like to see the day gain a new meaning: “I think it’s about time that the people back at home realize the need to reconciliate [sic].”, As those in Vietnam celebrate and the Vietnamese in Boston mourn the past, Minh Trinh says that reconciliation is the work of his generation and future generations of Vietnamese., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"
1030,[Inside the Mind of a Phone Scammer],"[Phong Tran sat in the lobby of the C-11 district police station in Dorchester, waiting for a police officer. He was there to make a complaint., Someone had called him claiming to be from National Grid. They told Tran he owed $500 in electric bills for the nail salon he owns with his wife. “And I had to pay the bill right away,” Tran said.  , Tran is just one of thousands of fraud victims in Massachusetts. Federal investigators received more than 20,000 fraud complaints last year in the Commonwealth alone. People don’t always report those types of crimes. But that’s more than $10 million lost to scheming and lying. , As Tran was telling his story, his phone started to ring. ""It’s them,"" he said. And he put the call on speakerphone., “Hello Mr. Chang?"" a woman's voice said on the other end, getting his name wrong. ""This is Christina Sandoval from National Grid."", “Yes, what do you want?"" he asked., ""Yes, sir, were you able to purchase the same-day payment method?” she replied., Tran had just been describing how the person on the phone had told him he needed to buy a $500 pre-paid debit card at CVS and gave him a phone number to call back with the card information. He still gripped the card in his hand. Tran was out $500., This time they were demanding another thousand. Now he knew they were scammers, though, and he played along., ,  ""I have given you an hour. It’s already been an hour,"" she said, sounding impatient. ""You are not able to purchase a same-day payment method?"", ""No, I can’t make it now,"" he replied., ""And you can’t go get it?"", ""I don’t have money to go get it."", ""OK, sir, just wait for a technician,"" she told him. ""He’ll disconnect your power, OK?"", ""All right,"" he said, not upset, because he knew it was a scam., ""Have a good day,"" she said, ending the call., Of course, the electricity stayed on. Utility companies don’t demand instant payment; and they definitely don’t demand customers buy pre-paid debit cards. In Tran’s case, he’s actually a customer at Eversource, not National Grid. , “That is just not how we do business,"" said Eversource spokesman Mike Durand. ""And we always recommend customers if you get that type of call, hang up immediately and call the local authorities.”, The problem is, there’s not really much the local authorities can do. , “They’re often very difficult to investigate,"" said Lieutenant Detective Mike McCarthy of the Boston Police. ""Because often the numbers that folks are calling from are not a valid phone number.”, In the last year, Boston Police received more than eleven hundred reports of this kind of fraud. And McCarthy said they come in all forms., “We have individuals posing as parties who were involved in a car accident, and that they’re withholding medical help for somebody’s loved ones unless they send money,” he said., Other scams include calls claiming to be from the IRS, or a tech support or credit card company. Attorney General Maura Healey’s office received more than 750 complaints in 2016 that they classified as phone or impostor scams. Thirty-six of them were utility scams like the one Tran fell for., “Now we have a technology that basically allows a scam artist -- a criminal -- to go and copy someone’s actual telephone number ... and then call from a different phone but make it appear like they’re calling form that number,” Healey said., Healey said to hang up if you get a questionable call like this, then report it to her office., “When the money’s already been sent, most times we’re not going to be able to get it back,"" she said. ""Because oftentimes it’s gone, and gone overseas.”, When they get phone scam complaints, Healey’s office turns them over to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. Monica Vaca of the FTC says there’s actually not much they can do, either., “Even though there may not be a whole ton of prosecutions that result out of those complaints, when there are, we can get real money back for people,"" Vaca said. ""When there are, we can actually shut some of these enterprises down.”, Vaca said another way of fighting this is going after the money transfer companies. In January, the FTC reached a settlement with Western Union, which agreed to pay back $586 million to people who were scammed in these kinds of frauds., “All of those companies, they’re aware of how their payment mechanisms can be used to perpetrate fraud,"" she said. ""And so it’s really important that consumers complain to those companies.”, Green Dot, the company behind the payment card Tran used, says there are ways law enforcement can track down scammers through bank accounts. But at this point, Boston police only will say their investigation is ongoing., What about the phone number Tran was given to call once he had the debit card? WGBH News decided to give it a call. , “You have reached the central district business office of National Grid,"" the outgoing message announced. ""If you are calling to report a power outage, press one.”, At first, I couldn't help but wonder – wait, did I mix up the numbers? Was I actually calling National Grid?, When I got someone on the line, I asked for the name Phong Tran was given. But when she answered, as soon as I told her who I was and why I was calling, she hung up. I called back. I asked for the same name again, but this time a man answered., “Oh, are you the guy from yesterday, that I was drinking beer all night last night with his money, are you the same guy?” he asked., No, I said. I explained that I’m a reporter and tell him about Tran., “Yeah, yeah, he replied. ""I remember now, that guy sent me $500 that I was drinking beers all night with his money.”, He wasn't interested in answering real questions., “Where are you located?"" I asked., ""Give me some money, I will let you know,” he replied., “You realize you’re taking advantage of people,"" I said., ""I love it,” he said., I tried to put a personal face on the victim of his scam. “The person who’s money you took is Mr. Phong Tran, needed that money,"" I told him. ""He’s not a rich man, and he didn’t understand what he was doing when he gave it to you."", That was met with maniacal laughter. It was, as I see it, the voice of someone who’s unrepentant and unworried about getting caught. We spoke like this for about six minutes. Then he hung up., When I spoke with Phong Tran in the police station that day, he wasn’t making his complaint in the hopes of getting his money back. He was resigned to that loss., “I just want, in the future, they don’t scam somebody else, you know?” he said., Unfortunately, at least for now, the scammers are probably still at it. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
1031,[LISTEN: What's Next For The Long Island Bridge?],"[
	Long-awaited plans to rebuild Boston's Long Island Bridge appear to have stalled out. Long Island once provided housing to some of the city's homeless population, with shelters on the island. But the bridge that connected Long Island to the mainland has been shut down since 2014, and as such, those who were housed on the island have had to relocate. The city says that it's conducting a cost-benefit analysis of whether repairs to the bridge would be worthwhile. For the time-being, advocates for the homeless report that the majority of those who did rely on Long Island for shelter have found beds elsewhere.
	 
	Jack Sullivan, a writer for CommonWealth Magazine, has been looking at the city of Boston's handling of the Long Island Bridge. He examined records pertaining to the project, and spoke with WGBH All Things Considered host Barbara Howard about what he found.

1041,[Jonathan Gruber: Tax Plan Would Benefit The 'Very Richest Americans'],"[President Trump’s administration released a one-page summary of its tax plan to widespread criticism yesterday., Experts are saying the plan is vague and the available information illustrates a preference for the country’s wealthiest residents., MIT economist Jonathan Gruber broke down the outline on Boston Public Radio today., “He would cut the top rate for the wealthiest individuals in America, he would cut the tax rate that corporations pay on their earnings, he’d get rid of the estate tax paid by only 5,000 families each year but raising more than $10 billion a year, and he would allow pass-through corporations such as his own to pay taxes at a lower tax rate,” said Gruber., One thing all these reforms have in common?, “The benefits are concentrated in the very richest Americans,” he said., Gruber admitted a part of Trump’s plan, raising the standard deduction, would benefit the middle class. Still, he maintained that was a “tiny part of his proposal.”, Trump’s plan would allow wealthy citizens to drive more of their income into forms that are heavily subsidized, giving the rich a bigger tax break., “For most of us, we earn income from our employer, that employer issues a W-2 at the end of the year with our wages on it, we pay tax on that, or we probably pre-paid and we get our refund,” Gruber said. “For the wealthiest Americans, they have a lot more flexibility over what is ‘wages’ and what is ‘other income.’ And what this [tax plan] does is just widen the loophole.”, He also explained that cutting the estate and alternative minimum taxes benefits the “very, very wealthiest” at the “top of the income distribution.”, “It’s literally about the 5,000 richest decedents each year pay this [estate] tax,” Gruber said. “The top tax rate that he wants to cut is paid by only people who earn over $450,000 a year.”, Trump himself would benefit from cutting the estate and alternative minimum taxes., Gruber, like other economists, criticized the lack of information in the 250-word statement., The New York Times editorial board, for example, called the plan “laughable” and “skimpy.”, “This is an unbelievably vague statement for such an important policy,” said Gruber., Among the plan's most drastic cuts is the reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35 to 15 percent. Gruber said big cuts like this would lose the government money., “The bigger you open up those loopholes, which is what Trump would do,” he said, “the more tax revenue you lose and the bigger tax break the rich get.”, Jonathan Gruber is an MIT economist and a BPR contributor.

That order puts the future of the first marine national monument — about 130 miles off the coast of Cape Cod — in question., It was one of the last official acts of Barack Obama’s presidency — designating nearly 5,000 square miles off the Massachusetts coast as the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument., ""We're protecting fragile ecosystems off the coast of New England, including pristine underseas canyons and seamounts,"" Obama said at the time. ""We're helping make the oceans more resilient to climate change, and this will help fishermen better understand the changes that are taking place that will affect their livelihoods. And we're doing it in a way that respects the fishing industry's unique role in New England's economy and history."", But when Donald Trump signed his executive order, it called such monument designations a massive federal land grab., “The Antiquities Act does not give the federal government unlimited power to lock up millions of acres of land and water,"" Trump said. ""And it’s time we ended this abusive practice.”, Among the local groups that agree with Trump are lobstermen. , “To have one person to have such a unilateral power is, as we see it, is unconstitutional,"" said Beth Casoni of the Massachusetts Lobstermen’s Association. ""It’s going to put thousands of people out of work and hundreds of millions of dollars lost to the economy here in the northeast.”, , The Massachusetts lobstermen were joined by several other northeast fishing organizations in filing a federal lawsuit challenging the monument designation. That suit is now beginning to work its way through the courts., The monument designation banned most commercial fishing within 60 days, while lobster pot and crab pot fisheries were given seven years to clear out. Casoni said fishermen were already working with government agencies to make sure the area is fished responsibly., “Those management measures are in place,"" she said. ""So let the fisheries managers and the fishing industry work together to determine how best to keep these pristine waters pristine, while coexisting with commercial fishing.”, Environmentalists who had cheered President Obama are now in shock. Brad Sewell of the Natural Resources Defense Council said a rollback of any of the nation’s monuments would be tragic and unprecedented., “And it would really amount to a sellout of the American people for a favored few,” he said., The offshore monument, Sewell says, has underwater canyons deeper than the Grand Canyon and mountains bigger than anything east of the Rockies., “It’s home to whales and Atlantic puffins and countless fish species in these lush communities of deep-sea corals,"" he said. He fears all of these could now be at risk., Sewell said the designation came after a public process received a lot of support, and was ultimately a compromise., “Its area was cut back quite a bit from what was originally proposed to protect the most important resources while ensuring that the more valuable fishing areas were not included,” he said., The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is just one of dozens of national monuments that will now be reevaluated, totaling more than 100,000 acres.

The Walsh administration has pledged to spend the proceeds on affordable housing in Chinatown, funding for the city’s Franklin Park, and some would go to the Friends of the Public Garden – one of the groups most strenuously fighting the measure in the first place., The petition, sponsored by (outgoing) former City Council president Bill Linehan, can now be called up for a vote by the committee’s chair, Michael Flaherty, at any meeting of the whole Council and, barring a tectonic shift in Councilmanic alignments, the petition will likely pass., But if it does pass it will pass over the (anticipated) objections of a small group of Council members who have persisted in raising bigger questions about this deal., Only three of the Council’s 13 members have voiced an intention to vote “no” on the proposed home rule petition: 7th District Councilor Tito Jackson, who is running for mayor against Walsh; 8th District Councilor Josh Zakim, whose district includes Boston Common; and City Council President Michelle Wu., Despite comprising what appears to be a distinct minority block within the Council, these members have nonetheless raised and given voice to questions whose answers won’t necessarily be settled by a simple vote., The Shadow: Oversight or Trojan Horse?, One of many nuanced twists in the Winthrop Square / Millennium tower project is this: Even the lawmakers and civic groups most forcefully opposing this deal don’t object to most aspects of the development itself., There is wide agreement that Winthrop Square should be developed; that its current use, as a dilapidated parking lot, is a bad one; and that the city would be well-served by leveraging its ownership of an eyesore parcel in a booming real estate market to raise millions in the land sale and subsequent real estate taxes., The Council overwhelmingly approved the city's pursuing a developer for that parcel. Millennium Partners offered a substantially higher sales price than other bidders in response to a city-issued Request for Proposals., But it was only after that approval that BPDA officials informed councilors that they had become aware of a small hitch: the building would apparently cast a shadow over the Boston Common – temporary, in a day-to-day sense (it would dissipate by 9:30 a.m.) but a permanent affliction in terms of years to come., At Monday’s hearing, BPDA director Brian Golden admitted that the agency had failed to identify the issue and alert Council members sooner in the process; but he chalked that failure up to (in so many words) the leadership structure in place before Mayor Walsh made changes to the quasi-independent agency.  , That answer didn’t satisfy Council President Wu, who says that in a year of hearings on the matter the subject of a legal problem with the building’s shadow was never even mentioned by BPDA (then BRA) staff, said to BPDA director Golden: “If you're saying now that you would have done it differently had you known” – about the shadow, that is, “Well - we know now.”, As she left the hearing for another event, Wu was more blunt with WGBH News. Asked if she believed the BPDA had “mislead” the Council (in our words), she responded: “Yes.”  , Jackson has echoed Wu’s perception that the Council was at least mislead if not, as he put it to WGBH News yesterday, lied to., Other sources familiar with the issue have postulated that the untimely discovery (if that’s what it was) that the Millennium proposal would overshadow Boston Common was disadvantageous to everyone involved and that at the root of the thorny problem was perhaps incompetence, but hardly conspiracy., Who’s to be held accountable? , Councilor Tito Jackson may have a political stake in opposing the Walsh-endorsed Millennium deal. But he has also raised questions about how the city will deliver on its promises – and hold the developers asking for special treatment accountable – that have not received much by way of answer from city officials., During Monday’s hearing, Jackson asked BPDA officials whether the proposal before the Council, and all of the lucrative incentives therein, including the creation of jobs that include minority and disadvantaged workers, were enforceable by anything other than the “Memorandum of Understanding” reached between the city and Millennium. Jackson asked whether anything on paper included a “clawback” clause that would allow the city to penalize, fine or otherwise act on broken promises., The answer was a wordier version of: “No.”, , Gratuity or Perpetuity?, At least two major projects that cast shadows on Boston Common not only contribute to the Friends of the Public Garden in a kind of recompense – but do so regularly, every year., The deal before Council, shadow and all, indeed proposes to raise tens of millions of dollars for the Friends of the Public Garden – but only, as it stands, as the deal is signed., Some Boston Common advocates have pointed out that Millennium Partners has neither volunteered nor been asked to contribute annual sums to the Friends group, a non-profit that spends large sums annually to maintain the Common, the Public Garden, and the Commonwealth Ave. Mall., That doesn’t mean whatever donation by the project to the Friends group (likely between $10 and $20 million) couldn’t be annualized., Trading Shadow for Shadow, If you didn’t know that the City of Boston maintains a “Shadow Bank,” a clearly designated amount of allowable shadow to be cast of the Common and Garden, you might be forgiven. That would mean that you also wouldn't realize that bank of allowable shadow is almost depleted., But the same state law that restricts the construction of buildings that would cast shadows over valued public spaces allowed Boston to use what would otherwise constitute violations of those restrictions as a kind of limited currency that could be traded while, at the same time, controlled for overall preservation of the sunlight needed for the growth of trees, shrubs, flowers, and grass., As part of the deal before Council, approving the Millennium project would also trigger a premature and permanent closing of the remaining share of shadows in the city’s so-called “Shadow Bank,” a reserve of limited and fungible shadow space., Put simply: After this shadow, no more shadows., But, as dissenting councilors have noted, the “Shadow Bank” is already almost empty – in other words, there are few shadows left to spare – and used up almost entirely by … Millennium Partners, the same company now asking for an exemption to the shadow rule., To be fair: The company’s previous use of shadow space was approved and conducted within the same legal confines that would have presumably allowed other development projects to do the same., Still, as Council appears near a vote on a development that, in its most basic form, most parties prefer to the status quo – what might otherwise have been an easy political ribbon-cutting has been cast into, well, shades of doubt. , This story originally stated that Boston City Council approved Millennium Partners as the developer; the council had previously only approved the city's seeking developers for the land.  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
1049,"[FULL SHOW: Death Penalty Debate, Mayor Walsh, Fix-It Clinic]","[For the first time in 17 years, one state executed two inmates—just a few hours apart. Marcel Williams and Jack Jones—both convicted murderers—were put to death last night in Arkansas after a series of last-ditch appeal efforts failed. Last week, the state executed convicted murderer Ledell Lee as part of its effort to carry out the death sentences of eight inmates in all, before the supply of sedatives used in lethal injections expires on Sunday. Lawyers for the eight inmates have taken their case to the Supreme Court, arguing that these executions should not be rushed forward.

1050,"[Mayor Walsh On Re-Election, Addressing Racism &amp; Whether He'd Vote For Charlie Baker]","[Boston Mayor Marty Walsh joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston to talk about a slew of issues, including his re-election campaign, the Olympics bid (and the ten people on Twitter), addressing racism in the city and whether he'd vote for Republican Governor Charlie Baker (""we'll see what happens"")., ON HOW HE'D GRADE HIS FIRST TERM Walsh: I don't want to put a grade on myself. The voters will do that. I think we've done some very good things in the city around education... and on public safety. I mean I know that the councilor [City Councilor Tito Jackson, who is running against Walsh for mayor] was critical of us and critical of Commissioner Evans, but just look at the sheer numbers.... We are the safest mid-size city in America and, per capita, we're one of the safest cities in America., ON CRITICISM OVER BPD CLEARANCE RATE OF NONFATAL SHOOTINGS Braude: But Jackson is right on the clearance rate on nonfatal shootings—pitifully low. Walsh: But that was just brought up recently. Braude: That's right, David Bernstein, who works here— Walsh: I've never heard of that before in my life. Braude: But it concerns you, does it not? Walsh: It does concern me to some degree. But Bernstein also had an axe to grind with some of the police department.... He was not happy they didn't get back to him and— Braude: Well, were the numbers legit or not? Whether he has an axe to grind, who cares? Walsh: Of course the numbers are legit. But when you think about shootings in Boston, I mean it goes back to having guns on the street that we can't trace back to anybody. So we have an issue with guns on the street that we've been working on for the last three years., ON CRITICISM WALSH WAS TOO SLOW TO BRING IN THE PUBLIC ON THE OLYMPICS Walsh: I think in the Olympic conversation, we went out to the community and the Olympic 2024 Committee— Braude: But late in the game, isn't that fair? Walsh: No, no it was early in the game, but No Boston Olympics came out earlier in the game and they immediately took a position against the Olympics without having a conversation with me or anyone on the Olympic side to see what it meant. Braude: Well you were disparaging them, even when they started, you were talking about ten guys on Twitter. Wasn't that you? Walsh: Yeah, who criticized me, yeah. If you go back and count the numbers, it was ten people on Twitter. Now it'll start it all over again, thank you. Braude: They won, didn't they? Walsh: I don't know if they necessarily won. I don't think anyone really won or lost there..... I mean I think the city of Boston gained recognition of being chosen as a potential city to host an Olympic Game. I think that's a good thing. , ON THE WINTHROP SQUARE TOWER CONTROVERSY Braude: Michelle Wu, after the hearing, head of the City Council, spoke to a 'GBH reporter last night. She said the BPDA, formerly the BRA, ""misled"" the council. Here's what she said: ""There were multiple hearings. There was almost a year of process, just in my time on the council. Not once in all those public conversations did the shadow issue come up. Folks on the BPDA knew about it."" Walsh: Why did the president of the council schedule a hearing for this to transfer the land over from the transportation— Braude: I have no idea. Walsh: I mean we should go back and ask her that. Braude: But when she says the successor of the BRA misled the council, that's not true? Walsh: That's not true. The only thing that happened here was when we transferred the land over from transportation, over to the BPDA, the council put a notification out. The notification put out was wrong, which led to a FOIA [Freedom Of Information Request], which led to the attorney general looking to see if they if they actually did it properly. The attorney general gave them a pass at the end of the day. This has been one of the most open, transparent issues and projects we've had. Braude: So you think Wu's got an axe to grind, too? Walsh: Well I don't know if she has an axe to grind, but I think that when you look at this, this is was worth $152 million for affordable housing, open space and parks in the city of Boston. And it's anywhere from $16- to $19 million in property tax. This is a deal like... we've never seen in the city. And on top of that... there's only one day that the shadow goes beyond 9:30 in the morning, there's 110 days that doesn't affect the public garden at all, and the Boston Common, and there's another 110 days, I believe, that has a shadow of less than 20 minutes., ON ADDRESSING RACISM IN THE CITY Walsh: I think it's important that we're having the dialogue around the city. I mean there's been a lot of conversations in the city of Boston over the years about talking about race and racism and I think what this [citywide dialogue on race] is going to do is really allow us the opportunity to begin to heal, have conversations around systemic racism, institutional racism... which exists, white privilege, things like that. And how do we deal with that stuff., ON GOVERNOR CHARLIE BAKER'S APPROVAL RATINGS Braude: A guy you work very closely with, the governor, the most popular governor in America—I'm sure you saw that Morning Consult poll—75 percent gave him an approval... Would you have been part of the 75 percent? Walsh: I probably would have. Yeah, I would have. I mean, I think on most thing's he's moved the state along in a good way. Braude: Where has he not? Walsh: I have some concerns around the MBTA and privatization. I have some concerns there. We've had conversations about it. They were able to get to an agreement with the Carmen's Union and I commended him for that and I hope they can get to an agreement with the machinists as well. There's a lot of people that work in that shop that... have pension paid in and healthcare and families and if you privatize it, they're out of work., ON WHETHER HE'D VOTE FOR BAKER Braude: You ever voted for a Republican in your whole life? Walsh: No. Braude: Would you consider voting for Charlie Baker?  Walsh: Again, we'll see what happens. I'm running for re-election for mayor. Braude: But it's possible? Walsh: You never know. I mean you never know. You never know what's going to happen. Braude: So, let's just be clear— Walsh: I'm not ruling out anything. Braude: You're not ruling out voting for— Walsh: I'm focusing on being mayor. Braude: But you're not ruling out—the people of Boston are entitled to know this. You're not ruling out voting for Charlie Baker. Walsh: We don't know what the field is yet. We'll see what the field is. Right now we have two Democrats.... I'm a Democrat. I generally vote Democrat—I vote Democratic all the time. I've never voted Republican.  Braude: But this could be a first? Walsh: You never know. We'll see what happens in the field., , Note: Transcripts have been edited for clarity and brevity. To see the full interview with Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, click on the video above.]"

1053,[Winthrop Square Tower And Its Shadow: Council Prez Wu Among Voices Calling Foul],"[On Monday, city officials told members of Boston’s City Council that the development deal now sitting on their legislative laps is one too good to pass up., But Councilors also heard copious arguments, including from within their own ranks, challenging the picture Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and his administration have painted of a no-brainer win for the city – among them, an unusually sharp critique by Council President Michelle Wu, who says the city’s planning agency mislead the Council about the very project for which it now seeks special legal exemptions., (Council President Wu and former Gov. Michael Dukakis pen Op-Ed in Boston Globe regarding Winthrop deal), The project in question is the massive 775-foot tower being proposed by developer Millennium Partners, and which would be erected on the city-owned parcel of land known as Winthrop Square, currently occupied by a dilapidated parking lot., And the special exemption in question – taking the form of a “home rule petition” sponsored by City Councilman Bill Linehan and supported by Mayor Marty Walsh – is waiver for the tower from laws meant to protect open spaces – Boston Common, notably, in this case – from being overshadowed (literally, that is) by tall buildings., City officials and the project’s developers acknowledge that the building would indeed cast a shadow over Boston Common and the much-beloved Public Garden. But that shadow, city officials and developers said, would be minimal, lasting only for a few morning hours., And the benefits would be many: about $120 million in a lump sum payment for the transfer of the land, with roughly $30 million more from subsequent development; $12 million annually in property taxes; and about $10 million in funds that would go toward affordable housing development in Chinatown., The petition, if approved by the Council as a whole, would allow the tower to be built, shadow and all, in exchange for those benefits and with a provision that the city formally close its (already mostly-depleted) “shadow bank” – a rolling reserve of permission for otherwise-unpermitted shadows., The petition was supported by a variety of groups; besides developers, it was supported by representatives from the Chinatown Community Development Corporation, the Boston Municipal Research Bureau, and is supported by trade union groups.  , Representatives from Friends of the Public Garden, the Boston Preservation Alliance, the Emerald Necklace Conversancy, and other advocates for the preservation of open and green spaces showed up in droves to speak against the measure., But members of the Council Committee on Government Operations, chaired by Councilor Michael F. Flaherty, were themselves divided., 7th District Councilor Tito Jackson, who is running for mayor against Walsh, was, perhaps not surprisingly, one of the more forceful voices of criticism of the proposed exemption., “To open an existing twenty-year law, move through one project, and close the door on other projects,” – by ending the allowance of shadow-casting developments after this one, Jackson said, “That to me, pun intended, is a shady deal.”, But at least as pointed, as perhaps more noteworthy given the political contest between Jackson and Walsh, were barbs lodged by Council President Michelle Wu., Boston’s City Council, Wu included, had encouraged the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), formerly known as the Boston Redevelopment Authority to pursue the Millennium Partners proposal for the site (one among others by other developers)., But at the time, the BPDA hadn’t mentioned the shadow, Wu pointed out on the committee floor – a point which BPDA director Brian Golden acknowledged, saying the planning agency is working on improving its ability to review such development proposals.  , That didn’t entirely satisfy the Council president., “Our responsibility is to conduct thorough, honest processes,” said Wu. “And if you’re saying you would have done it differently had you known – well, we know now.”, Speaking to WGBH News after leaving the hearing, Wu’s critique of the BPDA’s role in the process was more blunt., Asked if she felt that the BPDA had “mislead” the Council by failing to divulge the issues created by the building’s shadow, Wu answered: “Yes.”, “There were multiple hearings, there was almost a year of process just in my time on the Council,” Wu said, “and not once in all of those public conversations did the shadow issue come up.”, “Folks on the [BPDA] knew about it,” Wu said, noting that BPDA director Golden said that had he himself known of the issue he would have handled the situation differently., Nonetheless, Wu said, “We’re stuck with this false urgency around major development and revitalization of part of downtown, or nothing.”   , The rules of Boston City Council are such that the petition could be brought before the full Council by the committee’s chair, Councilor Michael F. Flaherty, as soon as the Council meets as a whole body, this Wednesday., Wu said she was not sure how the whole Council might vote, but that Monday’s hearing showed that “from the comments today, it’s pretty clear the Council is divided on this issue.”, Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

	The Baker administration's fiscal 2018 capital budget plan will include $78 million over three years to repair a crumbling, underground parking garage at the University of Massachusetts Boston, Gov. Charlie Baker's office announced Monday.
	 
	""The Baker-Polito Administration is committing $78 million to UMass Boston in this year's capital budget for the campus parking garage to support infrastructure needs and uphold our commitment to ensure UMass remains a successful and competitive public university system for Massachusetts students,"" Baker communications director Lizzy Guyton said in a statement.
	 
	Barry Mills, UMass Boston's new deputy chancellor and chief operating officer, told UMass trustees earlier this month that the school is looking to move its utilities out of a ""crumbling"" substructure, calling it a ""remarkably complicated"" project with escalating costs.
	 
	He said the campus is ""pretty much built on a big parking garage"" that has been condemned.
	 
	""It won't fall down, I hope, because it's been reinforced over and over, you want to talk about good money after bad,"" Mills said at an April 11 meeting. ""This project is phenomenally expensive and the fact of the matter is...we don't have the cash flow to pay the interest to do this project, and it's a serious problem. Somehow we're going to have to come to an accommodation to figure out how we're going to get this fixed.""
	 
	UMass officials have said the Boston campus is on track to end the year with a deficit of between $6 million and $7 million, driven in part by the long-term infrastructure project, which includes work on utilities and the parking garage, that's ballooned over its initial budget.
	 
	""This is the most significant investment made by any administration in the 40 years since construction flaws in the substructure became known,"" UMass President Mary Meehan said in a statement. ""Completing this project is elemental to meeting the needs and potential of Boston's only public research university, an institution that is critically important to the City and the Commonwealth.""
	 
	The complete capital plan will be released in the next several weeks, according to Baker's office.]"

It’s washed within what I can best depict as patriarchal religiosity,” she said. “God, football and family has always been part of a ... muscular Christianity.”, She referenced Tim Tebow, who was reportedly an early mentor to Hernandez., “We’ve seen 3:16 so associated with Tim Tebow,” said Monroe., Price responded to her points, saying Hernandez’s religiosity and the motivators behind it are still largely unknown., “We haven’t heard him speak,” he said. “We have no idea what his faith life was. We have no idea what his journey is.”, Price also mentioned that Hernandez had a number of other religious tattoos on his body, and said these might serve as evidence that he was “wrestling” with his faith beyond the football-religion link mentioned by Monroe., “If this was the only scripture that he quoted, or more importantly, had tattooed on his body, then perhaps you’re right and I think then your pontification would be in vogue,” he said. “But I think the fact that he has a tattoo next to a gun that says ‘God forgives’ [is relevant].”, Irene Monroe is a syndicated religion columnist.

1061,[Proposed Regulations Target Lead Poisoning In Massachusetts],"[It’s been nearly 40 years since lead paint was banned for homes in the U.S. But much of that paint still exists, and each year hundreds of kids in Massachusetts test positive for lead in their blood. Now, new regulations may force more homes to become lead-safe, while at the same time making it more affordable to achieve that goal., Julianny is just shy of two years old. She looked around an exam room at Boston Medical Center with big, curious eyes, as Dr. Sean Palfrey talked to her mother about her lead poisoning., “Is she taking iron on a daily basis?” Dr. Palfrey asked her mother. Julianny was exposed to lead paint on the windows of her home in Dorchester. And that's cause for concern, because significant lead exposure to children is known to cause developmental delays and impact IQ levels., “The most important thing you can do for her now, now that’s she’s in a place that has no lead, is to teach her things, read to her, talk to her about all sorts of things,” he advised., *Check Massachusetts addresses here to check their inspection history and see if they're deemed lead safe.*, Lead exposure is measured in micrograms per deciliter. And although Julianny’s level was high, at 18 5 µg/dL, it’s still below what the state considers lead poisoning, which is 25. That number is important – because when a child hits 25, that triggers action from the state. Health officials investigate the home, and the owner is required to make the home lead-safe. But the state threshold of 25 is much higher than federal limits set by the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC  raises the alarm at any blood level of 5 or higher., Palfrey has been lobbying lawmakers on the subject. “We’ve been advocating to bring the level of action down from 25 to something much more scientifically reasonable,” he said. , The state is now considering changing regulations to make 10 the new blood level limit. A bill in the legislature would make the same change. State data suggests that change would require action in hundreds of additional cases. In 2015, 565 children in Massachusetts had between 10 and 24 µg/dL in their blood., “Which then not only helps this child, but all his siblings and future children who live in that apartment,” Dr. Palfrey said., But as the state considers stricter standards for lead levels in children, it's going the other direction with requirements on homeowners., “The proposed change in the laws are going to make the abatement standards much less stringent than they are,” said John MacIsaac, whose business, ASAP Environmental, tests homes for lead., Loosening regulations may seem like a contradiction. But for many people, the state's lead law has done the opposite of what it intended. A lot of homeowners don’t want to know if there’s lead in their homes, because then they're obligated to fix it, and that can be expensive., “Some people see this as an obstacle for selling the property,"" MacIsaac said. ""Or if they don’t feel they have to go the extra yard to get the information, they’re not going to do that. Including realtors.”, And MacIsaac said when he’s out doing his job, he finds a lot of lead. “I would say, anecdotally, 70 percent of the time,"" he said., That’s because more than 70 percent of the state’s housing stock was built before 1978, when lead paint was banned., , Children in lower-income communities tend to be disproportionately affected by lead poisoning — not because more lead paint was used there, but because homes are more likely to be in disrepair, including chipping paint. , In Boston, the highest-risk neighborhoods are Dorchester, East Boston, Roxbury, Roslindale, Hyde Park, Mattapan, Jamaica Plain and Allston, according to the Boston Public Health Commission., MacIsaac said the new regulations may make homes safer. They don’t focus as much on removing lead from places where paint is intact and unreachable, which run up the cost. They target things like chipping paint and windows, which are riskiest for kids., “We can make it safe for families, lower the cost, and we think as a result of that more people are going to get inspections done, because they’re not going to be afraid it’s going to cost them tens of thousands of dollars to bring the property into compliance,” he said., The cost of de-leading varies wildly based on the condition of a home. But the state Department of Public Health estimates the new standard would cut the cost of lead abatement by a third. Even so, it can get pricey., “There are a lot of resources for families to reduce the cost of lead abatement,” said Jana Ferguson, a deputy director at the DPH. She said the state gives zero or low interest loans to help offset the cost of the abatement. “In addition there are tax credits, $1500 per unit that the state provides.”, Ferguson said when the state started checking kids lead levels in 1995, there were more than 1,300 children who tested over 25 micrograms per deciliter. In 2015, there were 64 kids at that level. “So it’s been a really successful program,” she said., But she acknowledged there’s still a way to go. And she thinks the new regulation changes, which she expects to go into effect by the end of the summer, will help getting to the ultimate goal: lead safe homes., Back at Boston Medical Center, Palfrey seemed positive about little Julianny. That's because after her initial test, her family's landlord allowed an inspection, and has since had the apartment de-leaded., “If her blood level is going down, which I think it will be, you do not have to come back to see us again,” he told Julianny's mother., Palfrey said he hopes if more homeowners realize they should be testing their homes for lead, there will be fewer lead poisoned kids coming to see him in the first place., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

1064,[Phillips Exeter And Andover To Open ‘All-Gender Dorms’ Next Year],"[Head to the south side of Phillips Exeter Academy's campus, in the hills of New Hampshire, and you'll find a wood-framed house with white paint and black shutters. From the outside, Kirtland House is stately. From the inside, it's your classic dorm., Right now, it is a girls' dorm, but a sign on the bathroom hints at the future. It reads: gender inclusive restroom. Next year, this dorm and another one will become Exeter's all-gender dorms., Alex Myers, an English teacher here, says this all began almost two years ago when he would ask a group of about a dozen transgender and gender non-conforming students: What's been great? And what needs work?, ""Consistently, what came up as 'what needs work' was housing,"" remembers Myers. ""If you don't understand yourself to be a girl or a boy, living in a space that's designated just for boys or just for girls feels really uncomfortable."", The students knew what they wanted., ""They said, 'What if there was a dorm that didn't have a gender designation and anybody on campus could live there?'"", Next year, both Phillips Exeter Academy and Phillips Academy Andover are converting a few boys' dorms and girls' dorms to all-gender dorms. This comes as prep schools around the country are figuring out how best to accommodate transgender students and many are considering new housing options., As two of the oldest and most prestigious private boarding schools, Exeter and Andover are known as schools full of tradition. But they are also on the leading edge of this social change., In Exeter's all-gender dorms, each of the 20-or-so students will get their own room. The bathrooms will still be communal, but there will be a bit more privacy, including changing areas off each shower., Myers says everyone's first question is: do you really want hormonal teenagers of different genders living together? He says, like at every Exeter dorm, there will be a teacher living in the house to keep an eye on everything. And in the all-gender dorms, the teachers will also facilitate discussions about gender norms., Myers says he was surprised to see the number of straight students interested. He says one boy told him, ""I am tired of coming back to a place where people have conversations that are troubling to me about how they talk about women. I want to be in a space where I am having a very different set of conversations."", Alex Myers wishes he could have had those different conversations when he was a student at Exeter more than two decades ago., He arrived on campus as a young girl, but by 12th grade, Alice had become Alex. Yet, he lived in his same girls' dorm. And while he found the school supportive, ""there were people in the dorm who were rude -- for want of a better term."", Myers was the first openly transgender student at Exeter, and for the past 21 years, the school has addressed housing issues on a case-by-case basis. The all-gender dorms are the first time the school has developed a housing policy to accommodate students who are transgender, which includes an application process for any student who is interested., While all-gender dorms may be easier for LGBT students, Myers acknowledges students in traditional dorms might miss out on getting to know those classmates., ""That was something we talked about intensively,"" he said. ""Are we kind of skimming off a population and taking diversity away from our dorms?"", They decided that the very existence of gender-neutral dorms and their curriculum would serve as a model of how to openly address these issues., John Palfrey is the Head of School at Phillips Andover Academy in Massachusetts. He says the dorms are consistent with the school's values., ""Our idea is to bring young people from all over the world, from all walks of life, from all backgrounds and, frankly, from all gender and sexuality backgrounds,"" he said. ""So I see this as entirely in keeping with our long tradition."", And, Palfrey says, there hasn't been any pushback., ""The reaction to this announcement has been 100% positive."", Neither Andover nor Exeter would allow WGBH News speak to students. But Exeter did a survey, and Myers says a little over 10 percent of students who responded said they don't want the new dorms. Their reasons varied, but some said they liked the current system and didn't want it to change. Others said they don't think small groups should get special treatment., But what about the alumni?, Many posted on Facebook, and I talked to several. By and large, they are excited., Chuck Goldberg was a student at Exeter in the mid-60s when it was all boys and, more recently, he served as head of the alumni association of New York., His thoughts on all-gender dorms are clear: ""This is a very significant and positive step."", Some alumni have questioned whether the 15, 16 and 17-year-olds are mature enough, but Goldberg isn't worried., ""It's not going to be as some people, I am sure in their minds, are thinking: It's going to be a free-for-all!"" he said. ""I think anything but."", When he was at Exeter, Goldberg says gay students didn't feel comfortable coming out. He's glad things are changing, and he hopes all-gender dorms will open new conversations at old institutions., WGBH's coverage of K-12 education is made possible with support from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation., Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly spelled Kirtland House as Kirkland, and listed the school as Phillips Andover Academy, rather than Phillips Academy Andover., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

Just hours after a handshake with the pope in Saint Peter's Square, O'Reilly was on a plane back home, as Fox announced he was officially out. O'Reilly is reportedly getting as much as 25-million dollars severance--the equivalent of one year of his salary. Former Boston Globe reporter Tina Cassidy, now an executive Vice President at InkHouse, and Michael Jeffries, an American studies professor at Wellesley College joined Jim Braude to discuss O'ÂÂÂReilly'ÂÂÂÂÂÂs departure., The United Kingdom is getting ready for an early political season after Prime Minister Theresa May requested a general election to take place this June rather than 2020.

1067,[Is The Next Hot Place To Live Already Out Of Reach?],"[, Click the audio player above to hear the radio version of this story., The hilly street where Amanda and Mark Linehan live with their three-year-old daughter, Georgia, is lined with well-tended bungalows. There's a basketball hoop set up on the sidewalk and plenty of trees. One thing routinely disturbs the suburban quiet: when a house goes up for sale and is open to the public., ""There's hundreds of cars,"" explained Linehan. ""You can't even pull into your driveway, there's so many people coming to look at every single one that goes on the market."", She's sympathetic to those legions of house hunters. She and her husband looked long and hard before finding their home. They considered Cambridge, hoped to find something in Somerville and, ultimately, ended up further north in the city of Malden., ""When we realized how little we could get for our money closer to the city, we realized that this was, really, the best of both worlds,"" said Linehan., Growing up in Natick, Malden is not a community where she ever imagined living. There was no cool factor, no reason to make the trip. Fast forward to 2017, and Malden's reputation and reality are quickly changing., The online real estate company Redfin ranks Malden's Edgeworth neighborhood as the sixth hottest in the country. The ranking is based both on interest measured by online views of real estate listings and factors crucial to any real estate transaction: location and price., It's still possible to find a three-bedroom home for under a half million dollars in Malden. Redfin agent Travis Speck says $650,000 is the high end for a single family and condominiums start at $250,000. Nothing lasts long., ""It's much more competitive this year,"" said Speck. ""Maybe we saw 15, 20 bids on a single property [last year] and now I see 25 to 30 bids."", Seven miles north of Boston, Malden is sandwiched between Routes 93 and 1. The real selling point, however, is Malden Center's MBTA station. It's a 10-minute ride on the Orange Line to downtown Boston., ""It's our saving grace,"" said Mayor Gary Chistenson. ""I ask many people when they come to Malden what was the draw, and it's great to hear -- diversity, three separate school systems in our city -- but the one that trumps them all is convenience."", Christenson is capitalizing on the appeal of the city's public transit hub. The fortress-like city hall building that separates the train station from the city's commercial street will be torn down this summer. There are plans to replace an empty building with a robotics center. The city is in talks to build a minor league baseball stadium., At the heart of the downtown transformation are the new apartment buildings that ring the commercial center. In the last five years, Malden has green lighted the construction of 1,000 new units. The mayor hopes the apartments will attract single people and couples without children, easing the demand for the rest of the housing stock., ""We're trying to provide density in downtown to support businesses and then in outlying neighborhoods, we're trying to get people to make their roots in our city,"" explained Christenson. Many of those new apartments have yet to be built, but already the downtown is thriving in a way it hasn't since it was a shopping destination in the 1970s., ""I never thought I'd see that kind of activity again,"" said Neil Sullivan, ""It's coming back."", Sullivan grew up going to the Jordan Marsh and Woolworth's stores that anchored the business district. The storefront where his mother used to bring him to buy shoes now houses his cafe, Cornucopia. Nestled amid a mix of restaurants, barber shops and the popular entertainment outlet Boda Borg, Sullivan says business has been so brisk, he hopes to expand his hours to nights and weekends. He says he routinely fields inquiries from people interested in buying his business., ""I'm lucky to be here,"" said Sullivan. ""Trust me when I tell you that."", Amanda and Mark Linehan feel the same way. In the six years since they've moved here, they've seen fewer discount stores and more restaurants. They figure it's only a matter of time before Starbucks comes to town. There's another change they've been tracking, too -- the value of homes in their neighborhood., ""The things that are going on this street are $100,000 or $200,000 higher than what we paid,"" said Amanda Linehan.

The settlements totaled about $13 million., The women complained of unwanted advances, lewd comments and inappropriate phone calls, among other misconduct., After news broke of O’Reilly’s settlements, Fox faced public pressure to fire him, including from advertisers that backed out of agreements with the network., Fox News dismissed O’Reilly on Wednesday., Healey praised Fox, which is run by the Murdoch family, for holding its company accountable to standards set regarding the network’s culture., “What’s good to me is to see women coming forward and reporting, and actions being taken.

1073,[Legal Doctrine That Would Consider Hernandez Innocent Is Questioned],"[The apparent suicide of Aaron Hernandez as he was in the process of appealing his conviction for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd has brought new attention to an archaic legal doctrine in Massachusetts. The doctrine means Hernandez will likely be cleared of any wrongdoing in the eyes of the law., Ursula Ward, the mother of the victim, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the former Patriots linebacker. Lawyers in that civil case say Hernandez's death shouldn't impact their case., ""We already have what is called a summary judgement in our favor,"" said attorney Doug Sheff, who is representing Lloyd's mother. ""The issue of liability has been determined, and it has been determined that Mr. Hernandez is responsible for Odin Lloyd's death and the loss to Odin Lloyd's family."", Sheff said he hopes they can now proceed to the damages portion of the case, figuring out how much money from Hernandez's estate should go to Lloyd's family. But as far as the criminal case goes, Hernandez can now legally be considered an innocent man., ""Anything associated with that criminal trial is now as if it never happened,"" said Martin Healy, chief legal counsel to the Massachusetts Bar Association. ""It's vanished, it's going to be nullified and void."", That's because of an old legal doctrine in Massachusetts called ""abatement ab initio"" that goes all the way back to our days as an English colony. It basically says it's unfair to consider someone guilty of a crime if they die before they've exhausted their appeals. Hernandez was in the process of appealing his murder conviction., , Healy said this doctrine was seen when John Salvi died while appealing his conviction for murders at Planned Parenthood in Brookline in 1994. And it doesn't just happen in Massachusetts., ""It happened federally in the Enron case, when you saw Ken Lay die of a heart attack before sentencing, resulting in $44 million of restitution that was on the table basically nullified and disappeared, and the victims of that scandal were never fully compensated,"" he said. Even when there's no money at stake, this doctrine can be a slap in the face of victims., ""His family, his supporters get to say, 'well, was he really guilty? Because he didn't get to finish seeking that appeal, and maybe his conviction would have been overturned,'"" said Meg Garvin, director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute. ""And for the family, they are stuck with, 'we have an unfinished story about the murder of our family member.' And that is incredibly painful, and really a one-sided way to think about what happens in criminal justice."", Garvin says if there is a motion to abate Hernandez's conviction, she hopes the state considers opposing it on policy grounds., ""So that the debate can be brought to a head, and the state can consider whether it needs to change its policy,"" she said., Healy agrees. ""Given the fact that the country has more or less moved toward recognizing victim rights more forcefully, I think it's time to reexamine the doctrine,"" he said. He says he's not sure where he stands on what should be done to the doctrine, but the time for debate is now., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

And for many, the annual pain is a reminder of a promise not yet kept by President Trump, leading some, even is his own party, to threaten: no returns, no reform. Trump also signed an executive order Tuesday, directing government agencies to ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂbuy American and hire American.ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ A portion of the order also cracks down on H1B1 international work visas, which many technology companies use to bring in highly skilled, but lower cost workers from abroad.

The New England Patriots head to the White House Wednesday for their visit with President Donald Trump after their Superbowl victory. But the entire team won't be there Ã¢ÂÂ at least six players have said they will not attend, four of whom cite politics as the reason.

1079,[Hernandez Lawyer: 'I Do Not Think That He Pulled The Trigger On Odin Lloyd' ],"[""I do not think that [Aaron Hernandez] pulled the trigger on Odin Lloyd and I don't think he's responsible for that death,"" said Ron Sullivan, one of the two lead attorneys who successfully defended Hernandez against a separate double-murder charge in a trial that ended Friday., After a month of arguments and six days of deliberations, a jury found Hernandez not guilty on every charge except one gun-related crime. Hernandez had been accused in the deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were killed in a drive-by shooting in Boston in 2012. Hernandez is already serving a life sentence for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd, who was found shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's North Attleboro home., But that is a crime Sullivan does not believe Hernandez committed either. ""I think that Aaron Hernandez associated himself with some people whom he should not have ... but I don't think he's responsible for that death,"" Sullivan told Jim Braude when he joined him on Greater Boston. Sullivan was also confident that Hernandez did not kill Abreu or Furtado., , ""Alexander Bradley shot those two men,"" said Sullivan, referring to the prosecution's key witness, who testified that he was driving the car for Hernandez during the shooting and was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony. ""The commonwealth got seduced by the celebrity of Aaron Hernandez â they wanted to get a big celebrity ex-football player conviction and they got blinded with the evidence ... when, if they had taken a sober look at the case, they would have seen that the real killer is the one whom they gave immunity to."", According to Sullivan, Hernandez's latest trial and acquittals were a ""necessary first step"" in the effort to appeal his conviction in Lloyd's murder. That appeal is currently before the state's highest court and arguments have not yet been scheduled., ""If the appeal is won, I fully expect that he's going to ask us to re-try the case,"" said Sullivan, adding that he would be willing to represent Hernandez in that case, as would Jose Baez, who was the second lead attorney in Hernandez's most recent trial. Baez also represented Casey Anthony in 2011 and recently told TMZ that he believes Hernandez will be a free man someday because he ""always felt that this was a winnable case."", Sullivan continues to stand by comments he made following Friday's verdict, in which he called Hernandez a ""beautiful young man"" and has since been heavily criticized. ""I got to know him over the course of the year and got to know him as an individual and became quite fond of Aaron,"" Sullivan told Greater Boston. ""The Odin Lloyd conviction â we'll see about that. It's not final, as you know, there's an appeal pending ... so we'll see what happens.""]"
1080,[Patriots Fans Debate Whether White House Visit Should Be Politicized],"[The New England Patriots head to the White House Wednesday for their visit with President Donald Trump after their Superbowl victory. But the entire team won’t be there — at least six players have said they will not attend, four of whom cite politics as the reason. Some wonder if a well-deserved victory should be over shadowed by politics., Former Patriots defensive end Chris Long — recently signed by the Philadelphia Eagles — said in a recent YouTube interview, “When my son grows up, and I believe the legacy of our president is going to be what it is, I don’t want him to say, ‘Hey dad, why’d you go when you knew the right thing was to not go?’”, Fans like Gail O’Brien of Hyde Park are chiming in on whether the White House visit should be politicized., “I don’t think they should protest,"" O'Brien said. ""I think they should keep it separate and they should acknowledge that they won and celebrate it.”, But Felicia Amarial of Fall River says the players are free to protest,, “It’s their right, absolutely, if they feel strongly enough,"" Amarial said. ""They may have their reasons — personal or otherwise."", Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who missed the White House visit the last time the team won, will be at the White House this time. Brady, coach Bill Belichick and owner Robert Kraft have some ties to President Donald Trump. However, Tom Brady told NBC Sports Radio that his absence at the White House several years ago was not a slight to then-President Barack Obama. , , “Everybody has their own choice,""  Brady said in the interview. ""There’s certain years, like a couple years ago, I wanted to go, and then didn’t get the opportunity based on the scheduling.”, Most people we spoke to, like Jim Davis of Millis, agree it’s a free country and people, including Patriots players, are free to make choices — but a celebration of the most coveted win in the NFL is not the place for it., “I don’t think it should be politicized at all, not one single bit,"" Davis said. ""Just accept what the president has to offer and do it joyfully. I don’t think players should be boycotting.”, Some believe that if treated otherwise, the visit becomes more about who is in the White House than the teamwork that got the team there. , Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"

1082,"[For One Day, In One Massachusetts Town, Community Wins Out Over Divisiveness   ]","[The 121st running of the Boston Marathon was a day punctuated by smiles, laughs and high fives from participants and spectators. Runners represented a broad range of abilities, languages, countries and political sentiments.  That would not seem to be so unusual. But the tranquility and camaraderie of the day was viewed by quite a few people as a welcome relief from our current political turbulence and divisiveness., When you put 30 thousand-plus runners and wheelchair racers together it’s not clear who is a Republican, who is a Democrat, who voted for Trump or Hillary or who sat out the election. What was clear under partly sunny skies was that on Monday in Hopkinton, folks across a spectrum of politics and society, who were running or wheeling, were included. , The word ‘inclusion” means the world to Kyle Robidoux of the Mass Association for the Blind., “Inclusion is very important, whether it’s a footrace or employment or everyday life,” said Robidoux. “I think the work that Team With a Vision does to include atheltes who are blind or visibly impaired and running for the love of running but also raising awareness that regardless of your ability that we can do whatever we want to do.”, Robidoux is technically blind., “I was born with a degenerative eye disease and diagnosed at age 11,” he said. “I still have some usable vision but it deteriorates over time.”, Kyle began Patriots Day by running from Boston to Hopkinton and was preparing to run back to Boston — a total of 52.4 miles. He was taking a short rest at the Vision Center in Hopkinton and in the company of Kevin McCarthy, a running guide with Team With A Vision. , “Me lending my sight is a small thing to do, but it allows him not to have to worry about the potholes, the curbs or the other things that he can’t see in time to avoid,” said McCarthy. “So, it’s easy for me to do, but it makes a difference to him and makes him be able to run his race the way he wants to run it.” , Marathons are about individual times, but for the 190 runners representing Boston Children’s Hospital, including Kristin Williams, this marathon is also about community., “We’re all running for special causes,” said Williams. “I’m running for my son who is a two-time double lung transplant.” The team has raised more than $2 million for Boston Children’s Hospital., Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans was sitting inconspicuously on a stoop at the entrance to a parking lot in Hopkinton trying to blend in among the 30,000 other participants when he was spotted by a reporter. An experienced marathon runner, his last time on this course was four years ago — just hours before the bombs went off., “You know this marathon now will always be that more special because it’s run not only for personal reasons but also for the victims of that tragedy,” said Evans, who ran with his son John, a first-time marathoner. , Deb and Nicole Paganelli, a mother and daughter who were sitting in a café watching the runners go by, grew up in this quaint town. “I still live here after all these years,” said Deb. The marathon is “still just as exciting. It’s our fame here in Hopkinton.”, The noise of happy, boisterous runners did little to disturb Deb’s recently born grandson, Julian, who was sleeping soundly in a stroller. She’s passing on the marathon excitement to the next generation., And her daughter Nicole made this observation: , “My father is from Italy.  He met my mom here in Hopkinton.  My husband is from Brazil. And we all come back to Hopkinton. It just goes to show that a lot can go on in the world but we all congregate here.  We can put aside some nasty things for just one day and celebrate the goodness in all of us and so that’s nice. And we get to do that every year, on this day.” ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

It would give the Massachusetts Gaming Commission the final say about extending alcohol service for those ""actively engaged in gambling"" during those hours., The Chairman of the Commission said he and its members have not yet decided which side they'd come down if the proposal passed., ""We'll take whatever power the legislature wants to give us; it's immaterial to us, and we're totally agnostic at this point on the issue,"" said Chairman Steve Crosby. ""If the legislature gives us the authority, we will look at it and make a decision."", Supporters of the proposal say it will give the Commission the opportunity to keep casinos competitive, as later closing times could draw in customers who otherwise might not have come., Opponents have a long list of concerns: drunk driving, a cost to local bars, and a slippery slope of loosening regulations on the casino industry in the state., , Recent publications have also highlighted the use of drink vouchers as leverage to lure elderly people and gambling addicts back to the casino., Crosby said concerns about public disturbances caused by later last calls shouldn't concern Massachusetts residents., ""We have state troopers, we have gaming agents, we have the casino security people, we have cameras everywhere, so if you want to misbehave while you're drinking, a casino is not the place to do it,"" said Crosby., He said casinos operate under the same rules as bars regarding over-serving patrons, except casino rules are ""much more rigorous"" because of all the security., ""They can lose their license just like any other bar can if they over-serve people,"" Crosby said., Senate President Stan Rosenberg, a Democrat, has come down against the proposal, and the only operating casino in the state, Plainridge Park Casino, expressed its indifference through a spokesperson to The Sun Chronicle., Wynn Resorts, a company building a casino in Everett, has said it supports the proposed change., Steve Crosby is the Chairman of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission.

1086,[How Money Was Distributed To Marathon Bombing Victims],"[How can you put a price on the loss of a limb? Could you calculate the cost of debilitating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? What about the death of a loved one — what would that be worth to you? Attorney and mediation specialist Ken Feinberg has overseen numerous compensation funds for the victims of 9/11, the BP oil spill, the Pulse Nightclub shooting, and the Boston Marathon bombing as the administrator of One Fund Boston. Feinberg’s job is to put a price on pain.  , Feinberg joined Boston Public Radio on Marathon Monday to talk about how he distributed the money of One Fund Boston to the victims of the marathon bombing and the emotional toll his job can take., One Fund Boston raised $80 million from contributions from more than 200,000 donations following the bombing. As the administrator of the fund, Feinberg was tasked with distributing that money to the 260 people who were wounded, the families of the four people who were killed, and the many more people who claimed to have PTSD or lost money as a result of the Boston bombing., , “You think $80 million is a lot of money, but when you have 260 physically injured victims and you start trying to allocate that money, you quickly find out that there is simply not enough money to pay everybody who claims mental injury,"" said Feinberg. “What drives eligibility in cases like this is how much money is there to distribute, that is the key.”, While Feinberg has become proficient and adept to allocating money to victims, the emotional interactions he has with the victims continues to be the hardest part of his job. “It is very debilitating,” said Feinberg. ""You have to give [ the victims ] the right to be heard if they want, and that part of it, where you sit and listen to sobbing mothers, fathers sisters, brothers, victims, that takes a toll. Unless you have a heart of stone, you can’t help but be impacted."", Click the audio player above to listen to the interview with Ken Feinberg., Jason Turesky is an Associate Producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"
1087,[Marathon Bombing Survivor Patrick Downes Completes This Year's Race With Veteran He Recovered With At Walter Reed],"[In 2013, Patrick Downes lost one of his legs in the Boston Marathon bombing. Today, he completed his fifth Boston Marathon — this time, in the handcycling division alongside U.S. Army Sergeant Adam Keys, who lost both of his legs and an arm while serving in Afghanistan. Keys and Downes met at Water Reed Army Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, where they've both been treated for their injuries., Downes joined Boston Public Radio to discuss today's race, his recovery, and his push to make the Boston Marathon more inclusive for handcyclists. Selections from the interview are below., On competing in the handcycle division, A handcycle is just another way to complete the marathon. They come in different forms, depending on someone's injury level. They allow people of all ability levels to access a seat that's very comfortable for them and use their upper bodies to propel themselves — so you're using your arm muscles, your shoulders, your chest, your back. It's a preferred method for a lot of our wounded warrior friends because of all the injuries they've sustained to their lower extremities. Sitting in a push wheelchair just isn't all that practical for them over that period of time., It's an accepted way to race in many marathons across the country, and yet it's sort of hidden. There isn't as much acknowledgment or respect. We've been having this conversation with the BAA for a couple of years now — that we have to celebrate these athletes and respect them like every other athlete out there. That means a wreath on the head, and the winner with their national anthem, and some logistical changes to make it more respectable for people with disabilities. , On BAA chief executive Tom Grilk's disparaging comments about handcycling — and his subsequent apology, I get the sense [BAA organizers] value the tradition of the race. It's the best marathon in the world. It's the oldest. It has such prestige. I think those points are incredibly important. But over the course of history we change, and we adapt. People sometimes fight that change. But particularly with these wounded warriors, they didn't know change was coming. Everything changed: the way they see themselves, the way they relate with their families, the way they access the world, all that has changed. We have to change along with them., When the bombs went off in 2013, they felt a kinship with our city that has remained. They want to come here not only because of this amazing race, but because of what it means and the solidarity aspect of being here with the rest of our city., On racing this year with Afghanistan War veteran and triple amputee Sergeant Adam Keys, We rode together the whole course. He did a personal best time this year. It was incredible. He was thrilled. The guy just works his tail off, as does the rest of the [Achilles Freedom Team of Wounded Veterans.]  Adam is a very special person, an incredible character. He was at Walter Reed for five years. When he came stateside he had all his limbs, and shortly over the course of time and infections lost both legs above the knee and an arm below the elbow. So when he rides the handcycle, he has a prosthetic hand attached to one side and he's pushing with the other. If you want to see athleticism or heart in its purest form, you check him out on Heartbreak Hill. The guy just puts his head down and goes. Once we crested that hill he was soaking it up, yelling at the crowd. It was such an honor to ride with him., On the friendships he's formed with wounded veterans at Walter Reed, We have this dear friend at Walter Reed, Clark Cavalier, from the bayous of Louisiana. I would not have been friends with him, nor would he have been friends with me. Yet when we are at the gym together at Walter Reed, we are brothers. We push each other on, and encourage each other, and make fun of each other. It's just a special connection. That happened five days after the bombing. Guys came — walked into our room, rolled into our room with all sorts of medical devices and prosthetics — and showed us life was still possible after these injuries., Tune in to the audio player above to hear the complete interview with Patrick Downes.

1103,[Lawyers For Indicted Walsh Aides Tell Judge That Prosecution's Story Doesn't Show Extortion],"[On Thursday, a federal judge heard two hours of oral argument over the question of whether prosecutors’ accusations against two senior Boston City Hall aides are sufficient to warrant going forward with criminal extortion charges., City tourism director Kenneth Brissette and Intergovernmental Affairs director Timothy Sullivan – both appointed as senior aides by Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, and both now suspended – have each been charged with extortion for allegedly using their influence to improperly pressure the organizers of the Boston Calling music festival to hire union labor., Both men have pleaded not guilty., But the question before Judge Leo Sorokin in this week’s hearing was not one of guilt or innocence of the alleged criminal activity – but whether the very activity prosecutors describe would constitute criminal extortion in the first place., Lawyers for the defendants have argued, in a joint motion to dismiss the case before it goes to trial, that the prosecution’s own version of events doesn’t show extortion — largely because prosecutors never asserted that Brissette or Sullivan obtained, or even tried to obtain, money or other tangible benefits or property for themselves., Prosecutors counter that Brissette and Sullivan conspired to improperly obtain wages and benefits for the union members and, in the process, to advance their own careers via the alleged extortion., But defense lawyers told Judge Sorokin that the United States Supreme Court has held, notably in its 2013 decision in Sekhar v. United States, that the federal Hobbes Act under which the men are being prosecuted, applies only to cases in which the alleged criminal has used threats or intimidation to obtain “property,” and that the allegations against Brissette and Sullivan do not paint such a picture., Attorney Sarah E. Silva, who is representing Brissette, said that the defense was not aware of a single example in case law of a successful prosecution under the Hobbes Act that did not involve an allegation of direct tangible benefit., Judge Sorokin, who said he will deliberate before ruling on the motion, spent considerable time critiquing aspects of both parties’ arguments., At times he seemed dubious of whether the prosecution’s case really did describe the kind of crime being alleged; but Sorokin also repeatedly questioned defense lawyers as to why they are asking him to rule on the matter rather than let a jury decide.,  ,  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
1104,[Auto Mechanics Needed To Relieve Industry Shortage],"[There’s a nationwide shortage of skilled workers in all the trades, but the auto industry is especially in a panic because the folks who fix our cars are aging out, and not enough people are coming in to replace them., Fixed operations director Harry Haigh has worked at the Best Chevrolet dealership in Hingham for close to 20 years. And there’s one thing he’s noticed over time., “It’s been difficult for us to find qualified people, and I think it’s been a little bit of an issue for people wanting to get into the industry,” Haigh says., And that’s for a number of reasons. Technicians need to buy their own tools, which typically run about $30,000. The technology has also become much more complicated. We essentially drive computers now. And then there’s the flat-rate pay model. Every car manufacturer decides how long each repair should take., “If you take less time than what it pays, you’re good,"" says Haigh. ""If it takes more time, you still get paid what the flat-rate time says. And being a new person coming into the industry, you’re not going to beat the time. It’s an antiquated system but it’s the only system we have.” , The starting annual salary of an auto tech is $35,000 to $40,000. But if you’re not getting paid for those extra hours, you’re losing out. Haigh says his dealership provides a base salary and has created its own supplemental pay plan to make sure their employees get compensated for all their work. But most dealerships don’t do this., A nationwide survey by Carlisle &amp; Co. recently found that technicians are miserable — so miserable that almost a quarter of them left their dealerships last year. Another 25 percent left the industry altogether. Unstable pay and feeling undervalued were major reasons. MIT labor economist Tom Kochan says there’s one way to change that., , Having ""much more of a team oriented approach where the technicians had more control over inspection, quality control, and delivering it to the customer,” would do the trick, says Kochan, If you have a system in which the mechanic has ""to look the customer in the eye and say ‘this car has been fixed, I fixed it,’ you would have a very different kind of relationship and a very different kind of retention with employees.”, A return to the neighborhood garage model could boost morale and trust. But another sticking point is getting young people interested to begin with — and convincing parents that their kids don’t need a 4-year degree to get a job, says Paul Bresnick, a professor of General Motors Automotive Service Education Program, or GM ASEP, at MassBay Community College., “It's hard work. You've gotta love it, you've gotta want it, you've gotta love cars. Many people think that their child is too good for that,” Bresnick says., At MassBay, students can major in Toyota, GM, Jeep/Chrysler or BMW. Bresnick jokes that it’s the state’s best kept secret, which doesn’t help the cause. But, he has seen a slight uptick in student interest. For freshman Amanda Leonardo, who is the only woman in the program, coming here was a natural pick after studying auto body work at her vocational high school. She adds that the newer technology makes the work less physically demanding., “It's definitely becoming a lot less like grunt work, and more, [sic] with electrical, you have to do a lot of testing and measuring, so it's not as much 'heavy lifting,'” Leonardo says. “So, it makes it a little bit easier for people who don't have as much muscle strength,” she adds, laughing., Muscle mass jokes aside, one thing’s for certain: There’s a demand. And everyone agrees that changes need to be made in the industry to attract and retain talent. In the meantime, calling all motorheads., Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

1111,"[What Happens To The 50,000 Pounds Of Clothes Left At The Boston Marathon Start Line?]","[In just a few days, with the crack of the starting pistol and an eruption of cheers, the 121st Boston Marathon will commence in Hopkinton. For the past few years, this is where I've covered the annual event for WGBH News., It’s quite a scene. Thousands of spectators gather near the start line on Hopkinton Common, where a plethora of temporary tents offer goods and services, from fried dough to souvenirs. Tens of thousand of runners get bussed into this small town of 15,000 and take up residency, for a few hours, in an area dubbed the Athlete's Village. , Amidst all this, there is one little, logistical quirk that has long caught my eye. Those tens of thousands of runners arrive in the chilly early morning hours, almost invariably geared up in sweatshirts, jackets, sweatpants and the like. But when they start the race hours later, most set off for Boston in little more than shorts and a shirt, if that., By early afternoon, the road leading away from Hopkinton Common is lined on both sides with hundreds of plastic bags, all stuffed with clothes that were left behind. So, who is bagging up all this stuff? And what, exactly, do they do with it?, It turns out the answer to those questions hinge on one woman: Judy Pitasi., ""I've been involved with the Marathon for 26 years,"" Pitasi explained as we ambled across a quiet Hopkinton Common., ""My brother was a back-of-the-pack runner and I used to meet him at Heartbreak Hill with a dry shirt, bananas and water. I moved [to Hopkinton] in the late 1980s and contacted the BAA because I really wanted to get involved."", Over the years, Pitasi has housed runners, as well as worked water and security duties. But a decade ago, she found her true niche among the veritable village of volunteers and staff who get the race off and running here each year., There had been previous attempts to collect discarded clothes for charity, but the effort was far from centralized, and the results were — let’s just say, spotty., ""One particular year, the charity didn’t come and I was finishing up what I was doing and they were throwing all the bagged clothing in the trash and I went crazy,"" Pitasi said. ""I went up to the information tent and ... I was mad. I said, 'What the hell is going on? Why are they throwing this all away?'"", In her mind, it was a waste., A few months later, Pitasi got a phone call from Dotty Ferriter-Wallace, the Hopkinton Marathon Chairperson and the woman who, as Pitasi put it, she had ""passionately spoken up at."" And just like that, Pitasi was designated the founding captain of the Boston Athletic Association's official clothing collection program., ""I started with 10 people, walking myself from downtown Hopkinton up to the Village, which is probably a quarter of a mile,"" said Pitasi. ""I’d probably walk it 25 times through the day."", Along the way, she and her small team bagged up all the clothing they saw. All. Of. Them., ""Shirts, sweatshirts, sneakers, socks, anything they might be sitting on the ground with — blankets, towels, tarps, blow-up pool mattresses and yoga mats,"" she said. ""Just a plethora of stuff."", She also forged a crucial partnership with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay, which provides ten moving trucks to cart all the clothes away and put them to good use.  , ""They take a percentage to their own thrift store, and the balance gets sold to thrift stores across the country,"" explained Pitasi. ""And the proceeds from that go back to Big Brothers Big Sisters for their mentoring program."", In the early years, Pitasi and her small team would collect about 10,000 pounds of clothes each year — nothing to sneeze at. But after 2013, a service that allowed runners to have a bag bussed back to the finish line in Boston was eliminated due to security concerns, and the scale of Pitasi's operation expanded.  , ""It just exploded,"" she said. ""Now I have 201 volunteers. We cover all the way to Ashland town line, and now we’ve gotten up to 52,000 pounds."", For the record, that’s a serendipitous 26 tons of clothing — one for each mile in the Marathon. And the proceeds now cover the cost of a full-year of mentorship for about 20 Massachusetts children., ""They’re lifelong commitments, usually,"" said Pitasi. ""They get a big brother or a big sister, and not only do they do events but they follow them through school and they become lifelong friends, like family. It’s great."", These days, Pitasi is more of a program manager, but on race day, she still can’t help herself from getting hands-on. Case in point: Last year, when word came down that a runner had left his keys in a discarded warm-up jacket., ""And I had the dubious honor of going through the bags,"" Pitasi said, ""And I found the keys. And, of course, it was the last bag."", Did she get a tip for her efforts?, ""I got a very nice thank you note and a Starbucks gift card, which was very thoughtful,"" she said., Of course, the thoughtful thank-yous are not why Pitasi combed diligently through countless bags; it’s not why she was so enraged a decade ago to see all those clothes going to waste, or why she has worked so tirelessly to build her program., ""It’s just inside me,"" she said. ""I’ve gone without at a period in my life, so I know what it’s like not to have 'the best' or to have your shoes worn out or whatever. So I think I have a good understanding of what others might need."", So, runners, don’t hesitate to throw off those extra layers at the start of this years’ race. Lighten your load, because if you leave it, Pitasi is going to find it and make sure it lightens the load for someone else down the road.  , Edgar runs WGBH's Curiosity Desk, where he aims to dig a little deeper (and sometimes askew) into topics in the news and looks for answers to questions posed by the world around us. ]"
1112,[Tensions And Emotions Arise At UMass Boston Board Of Trustees Meeting],"[Tuesday's University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees meeting was the culmination of weeks of behind-the-scenes drama over the future of UMass Boston, its finances, and its leadership., The meeting was tense. It was the first opportunity for the public to hear both from University President Marty Meehan and UMass Boston Chancellor Keith Motley, who announced last week that he would step down in June amid growing concerns about the school's financial stability and academic mission., For hours, Motley sat quietly in the corner, his head down, as UMass Boston administrators promised to reduce the school's $30 million annual deficit, pledging to end the fiscal year with a gap of only $7 million dollars., ""While the Board has broad authority to ensure that university funds are spent properly, responsibility for campus-level decisions are delegated to the five chancellors,"" President Meehan told the Board., Meehan pointed out that second quarter financial reports had shown the Boston campus was awash in red ink after losing nearly half of its financial reserves., Meehan said his office ordered an audit. Then, last month, he hired former Bowdoin president Barry Mills to serve as deputy chancellor under Motley., , While some faculty have said that move undermined Motley’s authority, Meehan told reporters that the chancellor was on board., “Chancellor Motley interviewed Barry and was in agreement that that was an appropriate move,” Meehan said. “We’re moving forward. We believe that the failure here is more in the execution of the plan that was presented to the Board of Trustees by the Boston campus.” , But Motley's supporters have argued that he alone is being blamed for financial decisions that prior boards signed off on., , Meehan rejected that criticism, saying it's not about blame., “It’s about taking what is a very important campus to this city and state and getting it on a strong financial footing so that it’s able to complete its mission without dramatic increases in tuition or without getting itself into big financial problems.”, To address those financial problems, administrators are proposing deep cuts to classes and part-time professors, and pushing off expensive building projects that were supposed to complete UMass Boston's transformation from a commuter school to a research university., At the end of the meeting, Chancellor Keith Motley finally rose and spoke., “Infrastructure. Infrastructure. Infrastructure,” Motley shouted. “That’s what I worried about, and I let my colleagues worry about the rest of it.”, Speaking publicly for the first time since he announced his resignation, Motley recalled the nights he spent dreaming about the future of UMass Boston and worrying about the school’s mounting debt., “When I came to this institution from some other institutions in the city they said I was going to the Titanic. ‘Good luck,’” Motley recalled. “Two years later they were begging me to work with us. This university is on the move, and it’s because of your support. Don’t run from that!”, Motley told trustees that he would work closely with Mills to transition the school’s leadership, and he thanked them., “Thank you for allowing us to have the vision we have in a capital city in this Commonwealth as its only public university starting on a refuse site, which is a tremendous deficit to work from.”, Taking his seat, Motley rested his 6-foot-8 frame, leaned back and received a standing ovation., UMass Boston students, faculty and staff are planning to rally against the proposed cuts at another UMass Board of Trustees meeting today. , Kirk is the Managing Editor and Correspondent for higher education at WGBH News.

Only about 20 percent of top corporate board seats are filled by women nationally and here at home., “The top 100 public companies in Massachusetts have 19 percent of their board seats filled by women,” said Esper. “We still have 17 of those companies that have no women, not one, on their board.”, Esper is spearheading an effort she hopes will reduce that gender gap. It’s a three-day program called Board Ready Women designed to help senior female executives in Boston position themselves for board openings., “It’s an unbelievable learning opportunity,” said Christina Luconi, a veteran of five startup companies. “This has really piqued my interest in helping companies in a different way rather than just being on the ground and building them myself.”, Esper says there’s no shortage of women with the qualifications to serve on corporate boards, but she says they need to make their interest known., , “It’s a little unfair to put it on the women, but it is part of what happens,” she said. “If you’re not knocking and asking and being a little proactive, you may not get thought of.” , Business consultant Patti Fletcher has a different take. She says it’s not women who need to change their approach., “We have to stop trying to fix women and instead look at the system that got us here in the first place,” said Fletcher. “What we really need to do is focus on getting these women highly networked.”, Fletcher says women with the skills and experience required for corporate boards need people in power, usually men, to advocate on their behalf. Real change, she says, will only happen when putting women on boards becomes a priority. She suggests an incentive: money., “How about that executive search firm is also held accountable for hiring in women candidates, and that board is then rewarded financially for appointing female candidates?"" Fletcher said. ""It’s a start.”, Research, some of it more than a decade old, indicates there’s already an incentive for corporate boards to recruit women: more diverse boards produce better financial results.  , “I’m the mother of two daughters."" Esper said. ""When my daughter was born in 1997, if you had asked me if we would still be talking about these issues in 20 years, I would have said ‘Oh, we’ll be over this by then’. I realize now, we’re still talking about it.”, Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

1119,"[For This Syrian Yazidi Family And Their Jewish Hosts, Passover Is A Refugee Story]","[, Rachel Miller is grating horseradish in preparation for her Seder — the Passover meal — as Mizgin, her husband Adris, and their three children — ages 12, 9 and 5 — watch her work. The family are refugees from Syria and they’re spending the year living with Rachel and her husband in a Boston suburb. The youngest is going to a Jewish preschool., Mizgin’s family fled the city of Aleppo in 2012 and temporarily resettled in Istanbul. They are Yazidi, a small religious minority that's been repeatedly persecuted and that the United Nations says suffered attempted genocide by ISIS. The family arrived in the United States in January, just after Donald Trump’s inauguration and days before his first refugee ban., Now they’re experiencing their first Passover. The Jewish holiday is a refugee story, too. During Passover, Jews celebrate their exodus from slavery in Egypt 3,000 years ago. The bitterness of the horseradish that Rachel is grating is meant to signify the bitterness of slavery., Mizgin sniffs the horseradish root, which she says looks to her like ginger. Nine-year-old Areen declares it “very spicy.” But Adris tastes it and describes it as hot and delicious. Rachel isn’t surprised by his reaction. After two and a half months of living together, she knows he likes spicy food., They move on to the matzo. “When Jews left Egypt, they didn’t have time for bread to rise. It was flat, like the khubz you eat,” she tells the family, explaining the significance of the unleavened bread. “To remember that, on Passover, we don’t eat anything that rises. We eat matzo.”, Like Mizgin’s family, Rachel’s family has their own experience with loss. Both of Rachel’s parents were Holocaust survivors from Czechoslovakia. Her mother, Channah Berkovits, was sent to Auschwitz when she was 13., Channah, who lost her mother, father and two brothers during the war, is now 85 and lives near Rachel., Because of her own loss, Channah says she understands it in Mizgin, who refused to leave her home in Aleppo until the bombs were coming one after the other., “I was at my house until the last minute,” Mizgin says in Arabic. “The hardest part is when you have to leave everything you’re attached to. We took only our kids and our clothes. We all went out crying.”, ""Loss is very demanding,"" says Channah, who also knows how hard it can be to get beyond loss., “The fear of loss stayed with me all the time,” Channah recalls. “When my children for one reason or another didn’t come home when I expected them, after a certain time, I couldn’t control my emotions. Like post-traumatic stress disorder, it stays with you.”, But survivors find support and comfort where they can. One place is the kitchen, where cultural learning goes both ways., Mizgin and her family have introduced Rachel and her family to Syrian foods: makloubeh (often with meat and rice), molokhiya (Egyptian spinach), mahshi (stuffed zucchini), kibbeh and stuffed grape leaves., Rachel’s family observes Jewish kosher laws, which among other rules means no mixing of meat and dairy, and separate plates and utensils for each. It’s something she explained to Mizgin and her family early on., But Passover raises the bar on those restrictions. For the eight days of the holiday, observant Jews don’t eat bread or grain; they’re not even allowed to have it in the house. That was a shock for Mizgin’s family, since bread is a staple of their diet. So Rachel has cordoned off an area where the family can eat bread during Passover., Rachel’s mother Channah says one reason she managed to survive the Holocaust was because people helped her along the way. “I consider my survival helped by the human touch of whomever I encountered,” she says., That, no doubt, influenced her daughter’s decision to host a Syrian family of five for a year. But Rachel has discovered it’s not something that everybody would do., “When I told people we’d host a family, they were astounded,” she says. “They wanted to know why. I said, ‘What we’re doing is just sharing resources we already have. It’s not like we’re making sacrifices, putting our family in danger.’”, When Rachel thinks about what people did to save lives during the Holocaust, and the help her parents received, she says “this is really nothing.”, From PRI's The World ©2017 PRI]"

""Oh, clueless. You can only Google so much. And then I found Food Biz 101. And it was like all the things I didn’t know.”, , That 101 class was one of the projects funded by the state's $3 million urban agenda budget. Baker has awarded 16 economic development and housing projects across 13 communities. , Commonwealth Kitchen has received several awards over the last few years, using over $200,000 in grants on specialized equipment and improvements to its facilities to bolster its services to urban farms. The organization also produces farm fresh food products for schools and other institutions, providing locally grown produce to low-income populations., The state's grant program looks to build partnerships between community organizations to aid workforce development efforts, encourage entrepreneurship and build more mixed-income housing., , “Their ability to leverage some of our money to make those investments on behalf of some of their startups has been very beneficial to them and to the startups, and I would argue to all of us,"" Baker said. ""I mean, they have 150 people here, 70 percent of the business are women or minority owned, and I just think it’s really terrific.”, The state grants the kitchen uses for programs and equipment expire in June. Going forward, it’s up to the legislature to renew them in a tight budget season. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. , Mike Deehan is WGBH News' State House reporter.]"

Michael Capuano has been front and center in some of the biggest battles on the U.S. House floor this year: health care, internet privacy and, possibly soon, action in Syria — an issue on which the congressman has a cautious view., “I don’t like unscrambling the egg. It’s done,” said Capuano when he joined Jim Braude on Greater Boston. “It shouldn’t have been done the way it was, but it’s done ... I’m less worried about what happened yesterday than what happens tomorrow,” he added, saying he wants to know what the U.S. plan is for Syrian policy, future such strikes and policy outside of Syria., About Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation — which came after Senate Democrats filibustered and then Senate Republicans employed the so-called “nuclear option,” making it a straight majority vote — Capuano had a similar attitude. “It’s done,” he said. “I’m not there [in the Senate], so I don’t like to second guess ... My real concern is the next seat.”, He also weighed in on Donald Trump’s trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal, a push Capuano is not yet sure if he can get behind. “It depends how he [Trump] does it,” Capuano, who currently sits on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said. “The spending part of it’s easy. Everybody agrees a trillion dollars is just a beginning. We haven’t don’t enough to catch up. At the same time, it is exactly where do you get the money? And if the money comes out of school lunch programs, he loses my vote. If the money comes out of increased taxes somewhere, he probably could get my vote. If it comes out of debt, we’ll have to talk about that.”, Last week, Rep. Capuano made a speech on the House floor that quickly went viral. During a debate on internet privacy, he said to his fellow representatives, “Just last week, I bought underwear on the internet. Why should you know what size I take?”, “I think they’re going to regret this one,” Capuano told Jim about his Republican colleagues, who successfully reversed an Federal Communications Commission regulation that would have banned internet service providers from selling users’ browser history — including private health and financial information. “The average person understands it.

Others say it's a cultural choice in addition to a religious one. Still, others choose to wear veils to combat exactly the claims May was making — they hope to challenge Western feminist narratives that associate modesty with forced silence., The reverends pointed out that discomfort generated by the sight of women in Muslim traditional modest dress like niqabs and burqas is derived from stigma., ""When dreadlocks came out ... people felt uncomfortable with it,"" Monroe said.

1139,[Framingham Voters Pass Ballot Measure To Become City ],"[Voters in Framingham have passed a ballot measure that will make the town a city., The question on Tuesday's ballot asked whether the community of about 70,000 residents should change its charter and adopt a city form of government with an elected mayor and city council.

Although U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a national review of U.S. law-enforcement grants. , The administration’s list of jurisdictions which “limit” cooperation with ICE includes self-proclaimed “sanctuary cities” like Boston, New York, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia – cities whose mayors and city councils have articulated prominent policies stating that the job of their police departments is to protect residents from crime — and not to assist federal immigration officials in pursuing the deportation of residents who have not been charged with or convicted with a crime., But the list also includes many dozens of law enforcement jurisdictions, cities and counties which have not made such declarations but have established a floor for cooperation — like requiring a criminal warrant or judicial order before turning over to ICE officials people who haven’t been charged with or convicted of a crime., The most recent list of ‘non-cooperative’ jurisdictions or those that ‘limit’ ICE access also left out a dozen cities and counties included in the first of these reports. Seven of those jurisdictions were Iowa counties.  , A spokesperson for I.C.E. did not return a request for comment on the agency’s latest report., Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
1141,[Speak Russian? There's A Competition For That],"[India Cabot’s junior prom was Saturday night, but instead of sleeping late on Sunday morning she’s sitting in the basement of a building at Harvard, pressing her hair out of her face with both hands. Slapped onto her shirt is a nametag with her name written out carefully, phonetically, in Cyrillic., “I’m so tired, I’m dead,” she says. “I danced my face off last night.”, Cabot and her friend Kaley Arnof are preparing for their turn competing at the Olympiada of Spoken Russian. In a few minutes they’ll disappear into a conference room with native Russian speakers on the other side, who will test their ability to hold a conversation, recite poetry, and demonstrate their knowledge of Russia’s history and geography — entirely in Russian., If that sounds difficult, it’s because it is. As the event’s organizer, Cris Martin, likes to say, “It’s a special kind of student that takes Russian.” That’s pretty clear from glancing around at the students clutching their notes and poking at the beet-and-pea salad and chicken kotletki (or cutlets) being set out for lunch., Because they’re in high school, when their teacher leaves the room a group of boys pluck a clump of helium balloons off a table and begin sucking the air out of them. Because they’re here, when they talk in their new, helium-altered voices, they do it in Russian., , Founded at the height of Cold War in the 1960s, the Olympiada once drew hundreds of high school students from schools all over New England. But as tensions eased and interest in the region fluctuated, so did the number of schools offering Russian language programs. According to a 2008 survey from the Center for Applied Linguistics, Russian is taught in only 0.3% of the nation’s secondary schools., As the number of programs shrunk, so did the competition. A few dozen students now compete, the vast majority from the private Cambridge school Buckingham Browne &amp; Nichols, with a handful of others from Russian cultural centers and, occasionally, from Glastonbury, Connecticut. Yet there are still sixteen other recognized regional chapters around the country, and once every three or four years a group of American students is selected to compete at the International Olympiada in Moscow., Joshua Walker, who runs the Russian language program at BB&amp;N, has seen the language rise and fall in popularity over the course of his career., “When I showed up to college in 1997, it was like a lot of other colleges where they had these massive Russian programs with a lot of professors, and there were maybe six of us taking the program,” he says. “It was an ironic stage in Russian studies. Suddenly, it was so possible to go to Russia. It was under Yeltsin, the borders were open, as an American you could study there with no problems ... and yet attendance in Russia programs started plummeting.”, But this year Walker says he’s had one of the biggest yields for new Russian students, perhaps a reflection of the country’s growing importance — yet again — in U.S. foreign affairs. To illustrate the point, he plays a game in his classes to see how many pages in the New York Times they can go through before hitting a story about Russia., “Usually we get stopped even before you hit below the fold,” he says., , This year the competition has expanded in a new way: by including college students for the first time. A group of them are gathered outside the Davis Center auditorium, which is currently screening a few Soviet-era slapstick comedies. (One called “Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future” is about a hapless engineer who accidentally sends his building’s super back to the era of Ivan the Terrible.), Ayeon Lee and Samantha Pannone are both students at Northeastern and graduates of Staten Island Technical High School in New York, where — in a Cold War holdover — Russian was the only foreign language offered., As part of the competition, they’ve had to prepare monologues about their lives, and they’ve been brushing up on some idiosyncratic phrases to sound more authentic. For example, if someone tells you “good luck” in Russian, you say — wait for it — ”go to hell.”, “It’s not offensive,” Pannone clarifies quickly. “It’s like 'break a leg.’ Other people from other countries wouldn’t understand why we say that.”, You can imagine a miscommunication like that quickly tanking a diplomatic meeting—a scenario not lost on Joseph Hasbrouck, a freshman at Harvard from Pascagoula, Mississippi. In fact, it’s why he was interested in the language in the first place., “There seemed to be a need diplomatically today to have more people who are able to interact with people in Russian,” he says. “I think part of our problem is we can’t maybe effectively communicate.”, , Like Joseph, many of the students at the Olympiada are interested in someday working in diplomacy. Others have personal connections (Cabot’s brother recently married a Russian woman, for example) and some are just drawn to the challenge., But that’s not all. Sean Hunt, a BB&amp;H senior who goes by “Shurik” in class, is aiming for a career in professional sports management. Specifically, in basketball. More specifically, with the Brooklyn Nets., It seems surprising at first when he mentions that, when visiting colleges, a strong Russian program topped his list of concerns. But then he explains. About those Brooklyn Nets?, “The owner is actually Russian,” he points out., Later in the afternoon, the plug is pulled on “Ivan Vasilievich” and college students migrate into the auditorium for the awards ceremony. (The high school students receive their marks directly from the ACTR, and won’t get them until later.) Lee, Pannone and their classmate Isabella Ragazzi are gathered near the podium, balancing a pile of prizes between the three of them. Lee shows off her new propaganda poster of the Red Army, and Pannone, who won second place, has a book of Russian short stories printed side-by-side with their English translations., Perhaps best of all is the ceramic mug Isabella has won for third. It’s unassuming, with a small message in Cyrillic printed on the front in faded colors. But the text is the real draw., “It says, “Russian language is everything to us,” Ragazzi translates, and laughs., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

1146,[Lawrence And Chelsea Fight Trump: A Blueprint For Other Sanctuary Cities?],"[On January 25th, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that threatened to strip federal aid to so-called sanctuary cities that fail to enforce the federal government’s immigration policies. In Massachusetts, two of the state’s poorest cities—Lawrence and Chelsea—have filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order., Lawrence is an urban industrial city some 25 miles north of Boston. Waves of different immigrant groups have flocked to the city since the mid-1800s to work in the towering red brick textile mills that still line the winding Merrimack River. The mills have long been shuttered and the city is still trying to get back on its feet, but immigrants have not stopped coming to Lawrence. These days three quarters of Lawrence residents are Latino or Hispanic and more than 37 percent were born outside the United States., , English language classes are especially popular in Lawrence. Thousands of residents are on waiting lists hoping to attend ESL programs like the ones at the Greater Lawrence Community Action Council. Executive director, Evelyn Friedman, says the classes are invaluable., “Many of our students come and they have no English language skills and they’re working at very menial jobs and as they gain skills they move up in their organizations or are able to get better jobs,” Friedman says. “The other thing is that they can’t communicate with the teachers of their children.”, Lawrence could lose out big time if President Trump is able to follow through on his threat and pulls the city’s federal funding. Almost 30 percent of the population in Lawrence lives in poverty and the city relies heavily on federal aid, receiving more than $36 million each year. That's about 13 percent of its annual budget. The federal money helps support ESL classes, but also many basic services, such as the city’s public schools and its free lunch programs. , Lawrence Mayor Dan Rivera is the son of a single immigrant mother who once worked in the Lawrence mills. Growing up, Rivera say he benefited personally from many federally funded programs and calls himself a “poster boy for all the good stuff that government can do.”, , “I’m a public school kid [and] a public higher education kid,” he says. The GI bill helped him buy his first house, Rivera explains. “My mom was on food stamps [and] we did public housing,” he explains., Like most sanctuary cities, Lawrence police will hand over criminals to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) but will not assist with civil immigration investigations and detentions. Supporters of Lawrence’s policy claim it is a matter of public safety and that it encourages all residents, even those who are undocumented, to cooperate with local law enforcement., The Mayor says his cash-strapped police force does not have the resources to help more, even if he wanted them to. “I got 80,000 people that I gotta fight a drug war. I gotta fight homelessness problems and an opioid problem,” he says. “And to be punished, for not having that resource, it’s basically an unfunded mandate.” , Lawrence and the city of Chelsea are trying to block President Trump’s executive order and have filed a lawsuit that argues they are not violating any federal immigration laws with their policing policies. It also calls the executive order unconstitutional., Rachel Rosenbloom, an immigration law professor at Northeastern University agrees., , “So the question is, does the federal government have the right to withhold funds from sanctuary cities. Can the president cut off funds without Congress?”, she explains. “I think that the answer to that is no,” Rosenbloom says., While Congress can attach some restrictions to federal programs, there are limits, according to Rosenbloom, and it cannot as the Supreme Court has put it, hold a gun to a state’s head., “If Congress wants to have a particular program that it funds and it creates some strings that are attached that are specifically for that program that’s pretty common,” Rosenbloom says. “But if Congress uses unrelated funds and says we won’t give you these funds, unless you carry out immigration enforcement actions, the Supreme Court has said in other cases, that is not permissible under the constitution.”, Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, the Executive Director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice which helped Lawrence and Chelsea file their federal lawsuit, along with the Goodwin law firm, says he hopes, “that other communities in other states will be able to replicate the blueprint that we have created here and create a mix of civil rights, community based and sanctuary communities that all come together to speak with one voice,” to challenge what Espinoza-Madrigal calls President Trump’s “anti-immigrant agenda.”, The Trump administration has not yet responded to Lawrence and Chelsea’s lawsuit. Under the rules of the federal court in Boston, it has until next week to do so., Update: As of Monday, April 10, the Trump administration responded by filing a motion to dismiss the complaint. , Elizabeth Ross is a senior producer for Innovation Hub.]"

1148,[Caribbean Immigrants Plant Entrepreneurial Roots In Boston],"[Immigrants from the Caribbean have long contributed to Boston’s kaleidoscope of businesses and cultures—just drive around and you’ll see for yourself.   , In Mattapan Square, there’s Le Foyer Haitian bakery. And then there’s Garden of Eden, a Jamaican restaurant in Roxbury. People like 91-year-old real estate developer Ken Guscott, the son of Jamaican immigrants, who tragically died in a house fire in early March, helped turn parts of Roxbury and Dorcester into vibrant commercial hubs.  , A noted area landmark, Merengue Restaurant on Blue Hill Avenue, is owned by Hector Pina, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic. , “I am Dominican. I love my country, but I am also American,” he said. “My contribution to employment and taxes are also part of the economic driving of this country. This is why sometimes I hear people say that immigrants do bad to this country. We do good. We create businesses. We are part of the economic development of this country.”, , , And it’s not just ethnic restaurants that have sprung from the entrepreneurial imagination of Caribbean immigrants.  Across the state there are also small Caribbean-owned construction and moving companies, barber and auto-repair shops and doctors and dentists with their own practices. Economist and Northeastern University professor Barry Bluestone said that is par for course. , ""Our research has shown that we have quite an entrepreneurial spirit among our immigrant labor from all over the world, but particularly from the Caribbean,"" he said., Bluestone says, for example, that home health aides and carpenters often start their own businesses, as do college-educated professionals who immigrate from the islands. Among the most successful he notes is a local businesswoman named Colette Phillips., “Colette is from Antigua and for years she has been one of the most important people in the Commonwealth, not only because of her communications company, which is very highly regarded but the work she does in the community,"" Bluestone said. ""She’s somebody who represents what the Caribbean brings to Massachusetts.”, Phillips has been her own boss for more than 30 years, running Colette Phillips Communications. , “Entrepreneurship is sort of in the DNA of Caribbean people,"" she said. “My parents were entrepreneurs growing up so I saw that you could go off and make your own living, and I decided that I wanted to be an entrepreneur. I wanted to start something I could control.”, Shortly after graduating from Emerson College in the 1980s with a master’s degree, Phillips started working for a cable company, but was laid off. , “I was fortunate enough within a month of losing that job to be hired by Sonesta Hotels International and I told them that I wanted to eventually start my own business,"" Phillips said, ""and I made them a promise of what I would do for them and that if I accomplished those goals that I wanted them to become my first client, and the rest, as they say, is history."", Colette Phillips Communications is not the biggest public relations firm in the state—not even close. It ranks in the top 25, however, among more than 100 firms listed statewide.   , , “Could my business be a lot more successful? If you measure success by the bottom line absolutely it could be,"" Phillips said.  ""The fact that I've been able keep my business afloat for 30 years is nothing less than remarkable and I think it's more of a tribute to my Caribbean roots of tenacity, dedication, hard work and ethical conduct than it is to anything else.”   , And the bottom line?, “My company has veered anywhere between a half a million dollars and almost two million,"" she said. ""I would have liked to have seen it be even more.”, Phillips said years ago she made a decision to turn down all offers to promote cigarettes and alcohol, even though her father sold them back in Antigua. These are the staple products of many black-owned PR and marketing firms, but products that Phillip says have major negative impacts on black communities.    , “My focus mostly with clients are about helping them understand how to build their brand among culturally diverse consumers and women, and to advise them on their corporate social responsibility,"" Phillips said., Phillips says her business model sets her apart from her competitors: market-branding based almost entirely on knocking down walls separating ethnic groups and immigrants and non-immigrants—sort of like the old Benneton model of selling clothing, but in the age of Donald Trump., Every other month, Phillips convenes an event called Get Konnected, which has become Boston’s premier cross cultural gathering of small and large businesses executives.  Boston Mayor Marty Walsh spoke at a recent Get Konnected event., “Colette has used her podium to bring different areas together, whether through business opportunities to business connections,"" Walsh said. ""Look around the room tonight, you see a real cross-section of people that otherwise wouldn't be spending nights together. She has a unique way to pull people together. People respect her.”                    , , , , Hector Pina, holding court at his newest restaurant Dona Habana, says Colette Phillips has become a model for other Caribbean entrepreneurs, including himself., “Just imagine as an African American woman to break the ceiling and get big corporate contracts,"" he said. ""Like, she was the PR for the Boston Red Sox. You have to really be more than qualified!"", But while that can-do attitude is real, says Avi Chomsky, a Caribbean specialist at Salem State University, it’s an overstatement to say there is a Caribbean entrepreneurial spirit that distinguishes it from other parts of the world. What is distinctive, says Chomsky, the author of' 'How Immigration Became Illegal' is a history of slavery that has spurred inventiveness from desperation.  , “The Caribbean consists of many islands with very different histories, so to the extent that there's a common history that we could say leads to an entrepreneurial spirit, that might contribute to it,"" Chomsky said. ""Many parts of the Caribbean developed a tradition of markets where enslaved people could sell their produce. The Caribbean also has a history of escaped slave communities that became self-sufficient and produced for themselves.”   , The results of that tortured history can be observed today both along Blue Hill Avenue and in the market stalls of communities stretching across the Caribbean, including in Colette Phillip’s homeland, Antigua.

1149,"[MLB Changed The Intentional Walk Rule, And Sox Fans Either Love It Or Hate It]","[
	Opening day at Fenway on Monday meant more than just the start of another season for the Red Sox. It's the beginning of a new era in baseball, when it comes to one specific rule, and the change is controversial. 
	 
	Picture a close game, late innings, two outs. There's a runner just on second. That means if there's a hit, there's nobody running his way from first, forcing him to get moving. This is where the pitcher may go for the intentional walk, putting a man at first and creating a potential force out at any base. To do that, traditionally the catcher stands up and holds out his glove, signaling the intentional walk, and the pitcher has to throw four balls, way outside the batters box. 
	 
	But not anymore. A new rule says the manager can just signal he wants an intentional walk, and the runner can just take the base, without the four outside pitches being thrown. 
	 
	Asked on opening day what he thinks of the new rule, Red Sox manager John Farrell summed up the reasoning behind it. ""It's going to be quicker,"" he said.
	 
	It's one of several ideas Major League Baseball has been considering to pick up the pace of the game, and some fans, like Jim Vuona of Shrewsbury, think that's a good idea.
	 , , 
	 ""I think anything that speeds up the game, because the game's gotten a little slow,"" Vuona said. ""Not so much me, I can still watch baseball, but not enough kids are watching."" 
	 
	""The attention span is very short on kids now, you know what I mean,"" said his friend, Shawn Carey. ""And it's hard for kids to sit that long. So I think it's good.""
	 
	But in baseball, a game that is steeped in tradition, there's no way this wasn't going to be controversial.
	 
	""You know any rule changes in baseball, I'm not a fan,"" said Sox fan Stevie Pedler. ""I'm a traditionalist. You know, I think baseball—they should just let it be.""
	 
	She understands the desire to cut down on the length of games, but how much time could this save?
	 
	""For this particular rule, practically none,"" she said with a laugh. ""But you've got to start somewhere I guess.""
	 
	Other fans, like Kevin Burns, point out things can go wrong when those four pitches are tossed, which could change the outcome of the game.
	 
	""There are too many things that could happen,"" Burns said. ""The guy could throw the ball over the catcher's head, and the guy on second could advance to third.""
	 
	""I've seen it happen,"" said John Healey from South Boston. ""Or he throws it too close to the plate, and the batter smashes it. And there's another new rule they're trying to adapt for next year and I hope they don't—the extra inning rule.""
	 
	That rule would put a player on second base at the beginning of each extra inning. ""And I don't like it,"" he said. That idea is still just an idea, but the new intentional walk rule is now in effect.
	 
	In the end, there weren't any intentional walks on opening day at Fenway, so it's not clear if the Fenway crowd will greet the change with boos or cheers as they weigh in on this latest battle for the future of America's pastime. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

""And I think I saw Sojourner Truth on the list.”, Dr. Rodney Williams, the Governor General of Antigua and Barbuda and Phillips' cousin, says her success is not incidental., “Colette, you could always see she was a person with ambition, who aspired to be something good, something great,"" he said. , But Williams, a medical doctor, said for most natives of the Caribbean, success has not come easy., “We came from a rather agricultural background where our parents were in the fields working for the plantocracy,"" he said., , Agricultural work meant that most black Antiguans had little chance of rising, said Williams. Some, like Phillips’ parents, started their own businesses — stores that sold all manner of products — and they essentially unshackled themselves from the sugar plantations. Over time, Antigua’s leaders saw a critical need to transition to a more sustainable economy., “V.C. Bird, our first prime minister, decided to transform the economy from an agricultural-based economy into a tourism-based economy, and that made our people now begin to increase their earning power and enjoy a higher standard of living,"" Williams said., , , Antiguans began setting up their own businesses geared toward tourists, from taxi companies to beach chair rentals. But some experts say the irony of the entrepreneurial spirit is that many of the best and brightest — like Colette Phillips of Boston — have left the Caribbean in droves., Paul Hare is an economist for the European Union, who I caught as he was flying from the nearby island of Montserrat., “Many of the jurisdictions in the Caribbean find there is a real shortage of people who want to start businesses and be entrepreneurs,"" he said. ""Part of the problem is a lot of the better educated and more energetic people in the Caribbean have left to set up businesses elsewhere in the world, probably very successfully. But the Caribbean badly needs them.” , But Antigua, of all the 28 nations of the Caribbean, still boasts a relatively strong entrepreneurial sector — so much so that other Caribbeans migrate here. And here there’s still a belief, reflected symbolically in the nation’s highest peak, Mt. Obama., “Yes, we can,"" said Luke, the independent taxi driver. He says that he’s planning to buy a fourth taxi cab. , “I have to work towards that route to get to where I’m supposed to be,"" Luke said., As we drive back to Antigua’s capital St. John’s, a city of colorful pastel buildings, we pass by dental offices, butcher shops, hardware stores and cobblers owned and run by Antiguans. Colette Phillips thinks that is significant., “I grew up in a country where most of the people who were my parents' friends were highly independent, professional people,"" she said. ""You looked at all of the authority figures in my life and they looked like me, so I didn't feel in any way limited."", And as someone who went on to achieve entrepreneurial success in Boston, Phillips said she’d like to return to Antigua one day. It’s an idea that leaves her elderly mother, Ionie Phillips, now living on a hill on the Caribbean Sea, overjoyed., “Colette is—I haven't enough words to tell you about that young lady,"" Ionie Phillips said.

What are the steps we need to contemplate here in Massachusetts?”, Healey criticized House Republicans, saying they sought to undo important consumer protections for data stored by companies., She suggested that sold data may not stay in the hands of advertisers, a concern shared by many privacy advocates., “I have real concerns about what this means for consumers and how that data, data being collected on all of us all the time, might be then sold to other entities, and how consumers might be impacted,” she said., Internet service providers lobbied for the block. They say they’ll provide consumers the chance to prevent their personal data from being sold by “opting out.”, Healey also criticized U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions for failing to address privacy issues in an speech he made at the National Association of Attorneys General Annual Winter Meeting in February., Sessions spoke mainly on fighting violent crime during his address to the attorneys general, a move Healey called “out of touch.”, “Not once did he mention anything about ... cybersecurity, privacy; he of course didn’t mention anything about the justice department’s willingness to enforce laws around protecting consumers,” she said. “Unfortunately, we have a justice department that doesn’t seem to get it, that is out of touch with the realities of what is happening in our communities.”, Healey said the issue of data privacy has “real implications” for people in Massachusetts and said her office will continue to research protections., “On the one hand, we want to make sure that through technology and enhancements, people are able to take advantage of neat and innovative things,” she said, “but we’ve also got to make sure that some basic principles around privacy and the protection of your own information isn’t thrown out.”, Attorney General Maura Healey joins us every month for 'Ask The AG.'

""Why should you know what size I take? Or the color? Or any of that information?"", Capuano was protesting a bill passed by Congress that would block new privacy protections for internet users from taking hold. The protections, passed by the Federal Communications Commission in 2016, would have required internet service providers to obtain permission from users before selling their browsing data, including websites visited, medical conditions looked up, emails written (including their content) and—yes—underwear purchased., , ""They collect everything you do, every keystroke, every website, every email you send ... they will collect it, and they usually will be collecting it at this point in time for the purposes of selling it to somebody else,"" Capuano said., , Internet service providers (or ISPs) lobbied for the protections to be overturned, saying they were at a disadvantage because companies like Facebook and Google can already collect some user data and use it to target advertisements. (However, while users can choose not to use services like Facebook and Google, they're usually limited geographically to only one or two Internet providers, as The Guardian notes.), Capuano says the way to even the playing field was not to make things easier on the ISPs, but to get tougher on the other companies., ""The answer is not to get rid of the protections you do have. The answer is to add more protection so Facebook and Google have limitations as well,"" he said., The bill—which President Donald Trump is expected to sign—is a blow for privacy advocates everywhere, Capuano says., ""I like my privacy,"" he said.

High crime and poverty were some of the reasons cited for a high school dropout rate of 50 percent. Not to mention the fact that the school superintendent was indicted for embezzlement and drinking on the job., Jeff Riley was installed in 2012 to bring Lawrence Public Schools back from the brink. The state put Lawrence into what’s called “receivership” and made Riley superintendent and school committee rolled into one., When Riley first arrived, Lawrence was being called the city of the damned. ""We had some challenges, no doubt about that, but the extreme negativity that was happening in the city, it was over the top,"" he said. ""In some ways it was a rallying cry to say 'we’re not going to take this anymore'.”, Riley says he was given free rein to make sweeping changes. He could have fired all the teachers and started with a clean slate. Instead, Riley cut central office staff—by a third—and gave half the principals marching orders., Ninety percent of the teachers kept their jobs and were paid more in exchange for extending the school day., , There was a lot of talent here,"" Riley said. ""We didn’t want to come in to be an occupying force. We decided we were going to do things with people, not to people. We wanted everyone to feel they were welcome at the table."", He added back arts and sports because, he says, it enriches the overall education. And he’s worked hard to bring parents into their children’s education by making their lives just a bit easier—he’s opened an office that provides adult education, job training, and financial help., He also brought in Acceleration Academies during school breaks for students that need extra help in certain subjects. They’re week-long, intensive school sessions., Edgedliz Quezada is an eighth grader who spent last February break brushing up on reading and writing. “When you get this opportunity, you have to take it all in because not a lot of kids get chosen for this so when you get [chosen], you have to work hard,"" Quezada said. ""To get a chance to better your skills, it’s going to help you so when that test comes around you’re like I got this.'"", Students are invited to participate but teachers have to apply. The process is very competitive. Educators from across the country are clamoring to get in. It’s their chance to experiment in a classroom with small groups of dedicated students., Caroline Piers is a seventh grade teacher in Lawrence. She remembers her early inhibitions about the program., ""We get to try new things that we might be like 'yikes I’m going to do that with 30 kids?' No, it’s like 25,"" she said, ""But we’ll say 'I’m going to wait 'til Feb break to bust that out.'"", The experiment in Lawrence Public Schools seems to be working. In the past four years, the dropout rate has been cut in half. The district now has the best math and language proficiency results it’s ever seen. Longtime teachers like Piers are happy they stuck around long enough to see the change., ""I see the kids getting excited, and to see the kids I had as seventh graders now thriving in high school and they’re like, 'I get it,' and now they’re in high school and they’re still getting something out of school,"" she said., Lawrence has become a model for failing districts in other states that are trying to turn themselves around. In fact, in the past two years Massachusetts has placed two more districts into receivership, Holyoke and Southbridge, using Lawrence as a template., However, critics believe that the results aren’t good enough., Jim Stergios is the Executive Director of Pioneer Institute, a Massachusetts think-tank known for its support of charter schools. He says the bar for success could be higher., “We’re still at the level where proficiency is hovering between 50 to 60 percent,"" he said. ""So one of the questions we need to ask ourselves is if this is a remarkable success, are we dumbing down our definition of what success is for our kids? Shouldn’t we expect that our kids are 90 percent proficient, whether they’re in Lawrence or Brookline? And my answer to that would be yes."", This is something that Jeff Riley recognizes. “No one is claiming victory,"" he said. ""We’ve seen some improvements but we know we have a long way to go.”, Although there's no timetable for the receivership in Lawrence, Riley's contract is currently set to end in 2018. , WGBH’s coverage of K-12 education is made possible with support from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation.]"
1168,[Alaska's Legalized Marijuana Raises Question For Massachusetts: Will There Be Enough For Everybody?],"[As the Massachusetts’ recreational marijuana industry continues to take root, people looking to get into the pot business —and state lawmakers looking to regulate it—often turn to states like Colorado and Oregon for guidance. But there's a lot to learn a little farther north, in Alaska., Bryant Thorp greeted customers from behind the counter of his business, Arctic Herbery, the first legalized recreational pot shop in Anchorage., “Just the edibles today,"" he said. ""We’ll have flower again late Friday.” It was a message that disappointed some customers, like an older man named Frank who came in looking for ""some smoke."", They had pot brownies, cookies and other edible products that are supplied by another company. But smoking the dried flower is still by far the most popular way to consume cannabis. Since opening in December, Thorp has grown his own product in a warehouse connected to his small storefront, but he can’t keep up with the demand., , “My first 10 pounds lasted five days,"" he said. ""I had two and a half pounds that lasted two days. Then I had a pound and a half the other day, lasted one day. It just doesn’t last long.”, Recreational pot stores started opening in Alaska last October, and there are about two dozen operating now. And those businesses are having a hard time growing enough to meet the demand. Thorp said that’s because of the state’s rules., “Here in Alaska they said no to outside money and outside interest of any kind,"" he said. ""It has to be Alaskan owned and operated, financed by Alaskan owned and operated citizens.”, Thorp said that’s in keeping with the spirit of Alaskan pride. And it’s kept millions of out-of-state dollars and outsider marijuana experts from flooding into Alaska., Given that they can't meet the demand, you might think the residency requirement is both a blessing and a curse. But Thorp said no., “It’s not a curse to me,"" he said. ""That keeps Marlboro joints out of our economy. They could take all us little guys down if they really wanted to get into the business.”, Massachusetts has taken a different approach. In the Commonwealth, out-of-state experience is seen as a good thing., , Take Norton Arbelaez, for example. He used to grow marijuana out West. Now he’s running a dispensary in Brookline., “This was the Brookline Savings Bank, and it operated as such for the better part of a century,"" Arbelaez said., This former bank building is home to New England Treatment Access. And this huge space—with marble finishes and a two-story domed ceiling—couldn’t be any more different from that crowded Anchorage storefront. , , “We see on average about 600 patients a day at this location,” he said. Customers still line up to go to the teller here. It’s just now, there’s marijuana coming out of the bank vault, instead of cash., “It’s not just the flower that’s available,"" Arbelaez said. ""We have creams, we have pills, we have concentrates. We even have suppositories that we make.”, Like Arctic Herbery in Anchorage, this dispensary grows its own product., “The regulations in Massachusetts allow for out-of-state investment,"" he said. ""They allow for out of state expertise, and in fact they mandate the sort-of experienced operator. And that’s what’s so crucial is that these organizations and the Commonwealth have really recruited the best and the brightest from across the country, people that have operated responsibly in over a period of years in a heavily regulated environment.”   , Kris Krane, the president of the marijuana consulting firm 4Front Ventures said while out-of-state investment has played an important role in developing the industry in Massachusetts, most of the new businesses are owned by people from here., “Or at the very least, they’re Massachusetts residents that have partnered with groups from out of state that are bringing either capital to the project, or they’re bringing expertise,” he said., Krane said the residency requirement in Alaska isn’t the only key difference from the budding Massachusetts industry. “The adult use program here is not going to be starting from scratch like it is in Alaska, and like it has in some other states, but you’re going to be building on an existing infrastructure from the medical market.”, Even with a more established industry, though, when the recreational program does finally launch—in 2018, at the earliest—he says, like in Alaska, there may not be enough to go around., “It is quite possible that in the earlier days of the program you will see, if not stores running out of supply, that you will likely see purchase limits, because it’s going to take some time after the program gets up and running for more grows to open, for production to really scale to a fairly large volume,” he said. , Already, some medical dispensaries in the state are limiting how much customers can buy beyond the legal limits to make sure there’s enough for everybody. But at New England Treatment Access in Brookline, that limit is a half-ounce a day—enough for about 15 joints. So, you should be fine. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

She was careful to make the point that much of the comparisons made between Trump and Jackson have been driven by the administration itself., “Somewhere early in Trump’s administration, possibly three weeks in, he arranged for a portrait of Andrew Jackson to be hung in the oval office,” Koehn said. “There has been intentional invocation of Trump’s relationship or similarities to Andrew Jackson.”, , She said one of the grounds for comparison is “Trump coming into office with the promise to decrease elite power in favor of the common American,” a promise also made by Jackson., Koehn also noted the commonality of “a healthy and often voiced skepticism about entrenched politicians.”, “All those things are part of the Jacksonian mantra that Donald Trump is, at certain points, very happy to pull out of his wardrobe and wrap around him,” said Koehn., She also responded to the contrast between Jackson as a military hero and Trump as more of a novice., “Part of [Jackson’s] appeal as a president was that he was a tried and true military leader. I think the relationship with Trump has something to do with perceived toughness,” she said. “Both of these men in different ways by their supporters were perceived as very strong.”, Nancy Koehn holds the James E.

1182,[Breaking Down The Barry Cadden Verdict],"[Massachusetts' highest court has seen a few high-profile cases recently. WGBH legal analyst and Northeastern Law Professor Daniel Medwed breaks down the recently concluded trial of New England Compounding Center chief Barry Cadden and a major decision by our Supreme Judicial Court about property tax exemptions for places of worship., Last week, a jury rendered its verdict in the case against Barry Cadden, the head of the compounding pharmacy whose contaminated products led to a fatal meningitis outbreak back in 2012. The jury acquitted him of 25 counts of second-degree murder but convicted him on some of the lesser charges., Medwed says this verdict isn’t surprising for two reasons., First, the number of people involved and the idiosyncrasies of the compounding industry make this a complicated case. It's not uncommon, according to Medwed, for a jury to embrace a so-called “compromise” verdict — acquit on the top counts and convict on the lesser ones. , Second, a homicide charge would be a bit of a reach despite Cadden's neglect to adhere to industry hygiene standards, Medwed says. For a murder charge to stick, prosecutors usually must prove a defendant either intended a particular act to result in death or at least was extremely reckless in disregarding a substantial risk of death. “Here, because a number of people were involved in the actual production and distribution of the contaminated batch of drugs — including a supervisory pharmacist who ran the rooms where the drugs were made — I imagine it was hard to convince the jury that Cadden had the required mental state that he essentially knew taking these shortcuts could cause the production of contaminated vials that could lead to mass fatalities,” Medwed explains., What does this verdict mean in terms of his prison sentence? Will he just get a slap on the wrist?, Medwed says that's not likely. Cadden was convicted of more than fifty counts of mail fraud, and each of those convictions carries a potential 20-year sentence. It’s theoretically possible that the judge could make those sentences run consecutively to each other. What remains unknown is the number of victims and their families who plan to make statements seeking a harsh sentence for Cadden. “If I had to guess, there’s an excellent chance he — at age 50 — could effectively spend the rest of his life behind bars,” Medwed says. The sentencing phase of the trial will take begin June 21st., The SJC recently issued a decision in a case from 2013 when assessors in Attleboro sought to tax a large portion of the two hundred acre National Shrine of Our Lady La Salette. The city contended that the grounds — which include a welcome center, maintenance facility, land leased out for use as a wildlife sanctuary and a home for battered women — were being used for non-religious purposes. The shrine fought back on the grounds of the state’s religious exemption. The SJC ultimately came to what Medwed considers a split decision, ruling that Attleboro could not tax the welcome center and the maintenance facility but upheld the choice to tax the wildlife sanctuary and the battered women’s home.,  What are the implications of this case for religious institutions, which have been keeping a close eye on this case for years, across Massachusetts?, On one hand, says Medwed, some religious leaders have heralded the decision as a victory for religious freedom and are reminded that secular tax authorities have no jurisdiction to designate portions of property for religious purposes. However, Attleboro could tax a portion of the property that was leased out for use as a wildlife sanctuary and safe house, suggesting that the religious exemption is not entirely bulletproof. , It's unclear whether cash-strapped cities and towns might follow Attleboro’s lead and try to tax portions of property belonging to religious institutions, especially those that the organization leases out to other entities. Medwed adds that those portions could be exempt under a different provision of our law – for charitable enterprises – but not under religious exemption.,  , Ciku Theuri is a former Associate Producer for WGBH’s Morning Edition.]"
1183,"[Mass. Gaming Commission Chair Talks Online Gambling, Marijuana Legalization]","[Massachusetts residents may no longer have to travel to Plainville or wait until the Everett and Springfield casinos open to play their luck of the draw. If some lawmakers have their way, residents may be able to gamble from the comfort of their home. State legislators are looking at the benefits of legalizing online gaming—including the additional tax revenue and the competitive leg up of attracting industry developers to the region.   , Stephen Crosby, chair of the Massachusetts Gaming Commission, calls the prospect of online gaming a two-step procedure. “One is, should online gaming be legal in Massachusetts? That’s not up to us, that’s up to the legislature, pure and simple,” Crosby told Jim Braude on Greater Boston. “If it is legal, then we definitely have opinions on how it should be done, and we made recommendations. But we’re not lobbying in favor, nor are we against it. That’s not a decision for us to make.”, Asked whether he worries the easy access of online gambling could feed into addictive behavior, Crosby said he’s heard the same arguments against casinos, and that there are tools available to prevent excess, including ways to verify the players age and identity. “You can put in the same tools, you can put in an electronic tool that says, 'Do you want to keep playing?' So there are a host of devices just like the devices we are using in brick and mortar casinos where you can encourage responsible gaming and where you can discourage problem gaming.”  , The Springfield casino is slated to open in September of 2018 and the Everett one by June of 2019. Regarding whether he’s concerned about Connecticut building a casino a little over 10 miles from the Springfield MGM site, Crosby said, “If it happens, it will probably have an effect on the revenue to that casino, which will depress revenues to the state to some extent, but such is life, that’s America.” Were it not for casinos in Massachusetts, patrons would gamble their money elsewhere. “A lot of the money that they are losing, they were losing in other states,” Crosby said. “So, we’re bringing it back.”, “The more gaming facilities you have, the more gaming types you have, the more gambling there will be,” he said. “That’s one of the things the legislature will have to consider. There is this thing called the Starbucks effect, every time you put down a Starbucks, people drink more coffee.”  , Last week, Crosby offered his expertise to state legislators working on implementing the ballot initiative legalizing pot. At a hearing in front of the marijuana commission, he offered advice on how to execute a similar model for marijuana. “Which model do you want?” he asked. The kind “where one official appoints all members of the commission, or where the governor, the attorney general and the treasurer appoint the five commissioners, which we have so that no one person is responsible. In our case, I think the legislature felt that protected the appointing authorities, that protected the governor.”, As for whether it’s right that the legislature slow down the legalization process, he said it was. “They worked for 20 years to get the gaming commission law right,"" Crosby said. ""And for them to think about how to get the marijuana commission law right, to stick with the basic legalization, but to think about tweaking it in a way that might be better in the interest of the people of the commonwealth – that seems perfectly reasonable to me.”,  ,  , Azita is the planning editor for WGBH News and its flagship local nightly news show, Greater Boston.]"

Earlier this month, the couple was intercepted by undercover ICE agents soon after leaving the offices of their group Migrant Justice in Burlington, Vermont.

Their attorney, Matt Cameron, claims ICE was targeting them for speaking up for migrant workers., , “There’s nothing, absolutely, about Enrique that would set him apart other than his outspoken advocacy for his community,"" Cameron said. ""And I think that’s why we’re here today.”, “ICE officers conduct targeted arrests of criminal aliens and other immigration violators. ICE does not target individuals based on political beliefs or activism., The reasons for the recent arrests in Vermont has already been addressed publicly. On March 15 ICE officers arrested a 23-year-old Mexican national who was charged locally with a DUI and self-admitted to federal authorities that he unlawfully entered the United States. Two days later ICE arrested a female foreign national who surpassed the duration of a lawful visit by nearly a year; and another individual who was with her in the vehicle at the time, and who also has an active immigration violation. These were lawful arrests and conducted completely within ICE’s legal authority under federal law., ICE routinely targets criminal aliens and people who overstay visas by a significant period of time. If ICE officers encounter others during the course of their lawful duties, who also have immigration issues and regardless of their criminal history, those additional encounters can lead to an arrest at the time of the encounter. The Executive Orders and DHS’ memorandums on the matter are public record. They are the guides ICE is currently using with respect to immigration enforcement.”, ,  , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

Police Departments Could Be The First To Suffer If Sessions Acts On ‘Sanctuary Cities’ Threat ],"[Massachusetts and other New England law enforcement programs stand to lose millions in federal Department of Justice grants, with Boston likely to receive the brunt of the impact, if the Trump administration carries through with a threat to punish so-called ""sanctuary"" cities., Federal grant records show that New England agencies received over $7 million in DOJ grants last year. Nationwide, the grants totaled some $8 billion., On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned communities the Trump administration has deemed ‘un-cooperative’ with federal immigration authorities that they would become ineligible for substantial grants administered by the United States Department of Justice. , The announcement marks the most recent development in a long-standing vow by President Donald Trump to punish so-called “sanctuary” cities by withholding federal funds. In January, Trump signed an executive order pledging to ensure that “jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive federal funds, except as mandated by law.”, How, whether, and/or to what extent such an order might actually be carried out has remained an open question., Federal funds come to communities from myriad sources and can include funding for everything from colleges to hospitals to school lunch programs. And legal experts have questioned whether across-the-board cuts in federal funds would withstand inevitable legal challenges: the United States Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government may not “commandeer” states into enforcing federal law., Sessions’ announcement, however, represented a narrower and potentially more tangible threat: cuts to Department of Justice grants to so-called ‘sanctuary’ communities., So, what would that look like here?, Last week, the Department of Homeland Security Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released a report listing, among other things, nearly 100 communities and agencies across the United States that have adopted policies ICE deems in some way “non-cooperative” with certain immigration enforcement efforts – primarily, communities that refuse to hold individuals in custody based solely on an ICE “detainer,” effectively a request to hold an individual, without criminal charges or a criminal warrant, on the basis of an alleged or suspected immigration violation., The list included nine communities across New England, five in Massachusetts: Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, Amherst and Northhampton.,  In 2016, the last year for which comprehensive data was available, those communities received just over $7 million in DoJ grants; the City of Boston received the lion’s share of those grants, about $4 million, most of that for Boston Police Department programs., City of Boston , Boston Police Dept Justice Assistance Grant …. $447,390, Boston Police Dept DNA Capacity Enhancement and Backlog Reduction … $211,166, Boston Police Department, FY 16 Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Program: Expansion ... $200,000, National Crimes Statistics Exchange Implementation Assistance Program … $2,172,522, Boston Public Health Commission, FY 16 Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program … $1,000,000, City of Cambridge, 2016 Justice Assistance Grant … $32,576, City of Somerville, 2016 Justice Assistance Grant … $20,004, City of Providence, RI , Body-Worn Camera Policy and Implementation Program … $375,000, Relationship Building with the Providence Community … $225,539, City of Hartford, CT, Hartford Technology Innovation for Public Safety … $245,681, FY 16 Byrne Criminal Justice Innovation Program … $1,000,000,  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

They were telling me now they have the confidence to go to their first dance.”  , Since January, the foundation has given away about 200 dresses that range in cost from $60 to $200 dollars.

In an open letter to the Whitney's curators, artist Hannah Black said Schutz's depiction of Till was exploitative., ""Non-Black artists who sincerely wish to highlight the shameful nature of white violence should first of all stop treating Black pain as raw material,"" she wrote., Artist Parker Bright, who is African American, has been leading protests in front of the painting wearing a shirt that says ""Black Death Spectacle."" Some critics have called for the painting to be taken down or even destroyed. , , Joining Boston Public Radio to discuss the painting and the outrage it has inspired were Reverends Irene Monroe and Emmett Price. Monroe is a syndicated religion columnist, and Price is a professor and the Founding Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of the Black Christian Experience at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary., Monroe and Price both argued that artists have the right to portray the subjects of their choosing, but they believe that Schutz's work missed the mark., ""It's aestheticizing black pain and suffering,"" Monroe said of the painting., ""[Schutz] fits into what I can best depict as the trope of the 'white rescuer,' who de-historicizes the narrative that goes with Emmett Till,"" Monroe continued., Price agreed that the painting removed Till from his historic context, pointing to a statement made by the artist herself.

1194,"[Going Once, Going Twice: John F. Kennedy's Diary As A Young Journalist To Be Auctioned]","[A diary kept by a young John F. Kennedy during his brief stint as a journalist after World War II will be auctioned off in Boston this weekend.  The diary was written in 1945 when the 28-year-old Kennedy traveled through post-war Europe as a correspondent for Hearst newspapers. , , The diary has been kept all these years by Deirdre Henderson, who worked as a research assistant in Kennedy's Boston office in 1959 and 1960. Henderson still lives in Massachusetts., Henderson says she first met Kennedy when she was still in college in 1954. Several years later, when she was working at Harvard University's Defense Studies program, she met him again, when the then-Senator interviewed her for a job., “He wanted me to write speeches at first and I said, ‘Senator, I don’t’ think I’m ready to write speeches for you,’"" Henderson said. ""I said, ‘I’d like to do research on foreign policy and defense.’"", Kennedy responded, ""Fine, that’s one of my key interests."", , It was a demanding job which included interviewing experts, reading books, and writing up reports to inform the Senator and presidential candidate about complicated issues of global scope and importance., “You didn’t have computers and you didn’t have Google and you didn’t have any help,” Henderson said. “If he wanted something right away he’d call me in the evening and say, ‘Have you finished that paper?’ And the assignments came heavy and often.”, But Kennedy, she said, was a good boss. “He was a very nice person to work for, very considerate and kind.”, One day, Kennedy handed Henderson a small, leather three-ring binder. Inside were the 12 handwritten and 49 typed pages of a diary he kept in the summer of 1945, when he was working for Hearst. Kennedy wanted her to better understand his views on world events., The diary recounts Kennedy's remarkable experience as a young reporter, interacting with world leaders in the rapidly shifting world in the months between the surrender of Germany and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kennedy wrote his observations of the first meeting of the United Nations in San Francisco in July of 1945, offering criticisms and concerns about the formation of the fledgling organization., , The young reporter visited the destroyed Berlin bunker where Hitler died., , He wrote about the experience, and about seeing Berlin in ruins., , In July, Kennedy covered the Potsdam conference, and wrote his observations as Truman, Churchill, and Stalin grappled over what the world would look like after the war., ""If a split among the Big Four develops as far as long-time administrative procedure, it will be serious,"" Kennedy wrote. ""Germany will be unable to build and maintain communications, roads, canals, trade coal, and food. If we don't withdraw and allow them to administer their own affairs, we will be confronted with an extremely difficult administrative problem. Yet if we pull out, we may leave a political vacuum that the Russians will be only too glad to fill."", , “My job after that was to save it for posterity,” Deirdre Henderson said of the journal. She published it as a book in 1995, and has decided now is the time to part with the original, auctioning it off on Sunday., , “It’s his words, that’s why it’s valuable,"" she said. ""As a young man who would be president in 16 years. And when you think about it, his knowledge and his knowledge of history, and his insight into what was going to happen in the world ahead—really quite remarkable.”, RR Auction said the diary is expected to fetch about $200,000 on Sunday., The diary ends with Kennedy returning to Boston to begin his first run for Congress. Among Henderson's favorite passages in it is one sentence that still rings true today., “The best politician is the man who does not think too much of the political consequences of his every act,"" she read out of Kennedy's journal., ""Isn’t that good?” she asked., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

He could have used LED light bulbs to bring that monthly bill down, but the growing expert he hired to set things up advised against it., “LED is not making a dent yet,"" Rosenfeld said. ""It’s simply not proven to be an effective lighting method.”, These are the kinds of questions that are coming up as Massachusetts’ newest industry starts to set up shop. What steps can be taken and what, if anything, should be required to cut back on the industry’s huge demand for energy?, “We are a big footprint industry,"" he said. ""It is what it is. It doesn’t mean that we can’t be efficient while we do it.”, Marijuana was a hot topic at a recent convention of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association here in Boston. John Morris, the founder of a new non-profit devoted to the topic, told a packed room at the conference that in 2011, one percent of the entire U.S. electricity load—$6 billion in electricity—came just from marijuana growing., “More recently in 2016, studies indicate that 2 percent of Colorado’s load and 45 percent of all new load was attributed to cannabis growing indoors [in Coloardo],” he said., , The emcee of the discussion was Fred Davis, who runs his own efficient lighting distributorship. Davis points out in recent years Massachusetts has been ranked the best in the country for reducing its energy use. , “Medical marijuana will surely put us back, if it’s all indoor grown, will surely put us back at least one year,"" Davis said. ""When we get to recreational, how could it not put us back two or three years?”, Davis says he wants to see marijuana grown outside, as nature intended. But state law doesn’t allow that, and the industry isn’t eager to go that way since it couldn’t be done year-round here. Also, the plants grow faster when they can continually be illuminated, even at night. And outdoor growing leads to concerns about security and the possibility of pesticides drifting from other fields., Of  course, there’s also the option of greenhouses. Norton Arbelaez is a standards and practices consultant for New England Treatment Access, which grows marijuana sold at their medical dispensaries in Brookline and Northampton. “If you’re cultivating in Arizona, if you’re cultivating in California, if you’re cultivating in Florida the nature of the agricultural process itself will advocate for that type of construction, of a greenhouse construction,"" he said. ""Here, I think the best we can hope for given the limited amount of sunshine that we have over the course of a year is perhaps a glass roof structure, so you can sort of have the best of both worlds.”, Arbelaez said his company is considering doing something like that when they expand their operations. They currently do use some LED grow lights and other energy efficient technology, and he said he’d like to see the state government provide incentives for that kind of thing., Fred Davis agrees that energy efficiency needs to be on the radar screen of legislators., “They are going to have a mountain of legislation – of regulation I should say – to deal with on all sorts of issues,"" he said. ""This needs to be inserted as one of them.”, The legislative committee tasked with writing laws to regulate the pot industry met for the first time on Monday, and one thing that did not come up was energy efficiency., When asked about the issue, the committee chair, Senator Patricia Jehlen, said in a written statement, ""Massachusetts has been a leader in green technology and energy policy, and as the marijuana industry evolves over the next few years we will certainly consider the impacts on our clean energy goals."", But because the committee’s coming up with Iaws to govern the industry now, WGBH News put the question to Senator Jamie Eldridge, who’s also on the committee: Will energy efficiency be part of that discussion?, “I don’t know,"" he responded, ""but certainly I think it should be, and it’s certainly something I’ll be planning to raise at the hearings that the committee has begun to have.”, Eldridge pointed to the legislature’s rules for another Massachusetts industry that also used to be prohibited—gambling., “We put into that law requirements that the casinos had to be energy efficient, had to be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified and had to embrace alternative energy,"" he said. ""So it think as you see a new industry come to Massachusetts, including the marijuana industry, I do think that we should be doing that as well.”, With so much still to consider to get Massachusetts’ medical and recreational marijuana programs up and running, it’s not yet clear how much of a priority it will be to reign in the industry’s huge energy demand, before it really starts to impact the state. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

""Well, I mean it was just a tumultuous time,"" Dunn said. ""There was student unrest. The reality of Boston College then was that it was a regional commuter school, and it needed to attract students from a wider geographical area, particularly with a national focus."", BC in the 1970s and 80s was absent of significant numbers of  black and brown students says Joe Quinn, the former dean of arts and sciences and a professor of economics for 42 years.   , , Today, Quinn says, BC is a far cry from the school that Father Monan took over in the early 1970s. ""If you had injected folks with truth serum in the 1970s the optimistic ones would say, 'We will pull out of our current straights, we will become a great university,' but I doubt many of them would say that in 40 years we'll be ranked in the top 30 universities in America."" , Father Monan’s vision was for not only a larger school physically, but for a level of academic achievement that would catapult BC into the ranks of the most esteemed higher institutions of learning nationally. Quinn says he succeeded. Monan also stressed the importance of sports in campus life and lived to celebrate winning hockey, football and basketball teams over the years. , Father Monan's service is s expected to draw hundreds of well-wishers to his side to say take care and so long.    ,  ,  , Phillip Martin is a senior investigative reporter for the GBH News Center for Investigative Reporting]"

He’s been acquitted of causing the deaths of 25 people in a meningitis outbreak but convicted of racketeering. He was also found not guilty of defrauding the federal government., As the verdict was read, Cadden sat looking straight ahead and showed almost no emotion. His sentencing was set for June 21. Cadden will remain free on bail until then., Cadden was the president and head pharmacist at the New England Compounding Center (NECC). Contaminated drugs made at his now-defunct Framingham pharmacy caused the 2012 meningitis outbreak. It was largest meningitis outbreak in US history, sickening more than 700 people and killing at least 64 of them., During more than nine weeks of testimony, both sides agreed on one thing: People died as a result of steroid injections made at Barry Cadden’s compounding pharmacy. Those injections had been contaminated with mold., From there, the two sides told vastly different stories., Federal prosecutors argued that Cadden was a man driven by greed. He knew his drugs could kill people, and he still shipped them out., Prosecutors had two big allegations. First, that Cadden’s pharmacy was filthy – teaming with mold and insects. And under his direction, employees used expired ingredients and improperly tested drugs., Second, prosecutors said Cadden’s outfit skirted regulations to avoid federal oversight. NECC fabricated prescriptions to look like a retail pharmacy and not what they really were: a drug manufacturer. That way they fell under state regulations and not under federal authorities., Cadden’s defense attorneys countered that it was the pharmacy’s employees and contractors that ignored safety regulations and wrote fake prescriptions. And, as soon as Cadden saw a problem, he worked “aggressively and appropriately” to fix it., Federal prosecutors charged Cadden with 96 criminal counts, including fraud and racketeering. Under the racketeering charge, prosecutors listed 25 counts of second-degree murder., The government did not seek to prove Cadden intended to murder the patients with his drugs. Instead, they argued that he’d demonstrated an extreme indifference to human life., However, Cadden’s defense attorneys argued that proving intent was necessary and that Cadden didn't intend to harm anyone. They said that as soon as Cadden found a problem caused by his employees or contractors, he worked tried to fix it., On the second-degree murder charges, jurors ended up siding with the defense because they did not hold him directly responsible for the deaths., Federal prosecutors also argued that Cadden tried to avoid regulators through a complex scheme involving fake prescriptions. He wanted to make it look like his compounding pharmacy was filling individual prescriptions, prosecutors alleged. That way, they would be overseen by state regulators, whom Cadden knew to be overburdened., The reality, prosecutors said, is that Cadden was producing bulk medication and should have been classified as a drug manufacture. Cadden tried to avoid that, they argued, because it would have meant more federal oversight., According to the federal prosecutors, this amounted to defrauding the U.S. Food and Drug Administration., However, Cadden’s defense attorneys argued that it was employees and customers who faked the prescriptions. Plus, they said it was an incredibly murky regulatory landscape and that even the former FDA didn’t think the law was clear on which body had authority over who., The Associated Press contributed to this report., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

He appeared to make good on that promise when he signed an executive order to accelerate deportation of undocumented residents., “When my parents go to work, it’s scary [to think] that they won’t come back,” said Iris, a BCLA senior who requested WGBH News use her first name only. A native of Guatemala, she’s been in the United States since the seventh grade and is active in her school’s chapter of an organization called Student Immigration Movement., “We still have rights, it’s not like we don’t have any rights,” she said., , The Department of Justice spelled out those rights in a 2014 “Dear Colleague” letter, reminding schools that students are entitled to an education “whether present in the United States legally or otherwise."" The letter also indicates schools are restricted from asking about the immigration status of a student or family to establish residency or enrollment., The result is that in Boston—and other school districts—it’s policy not to ask about immigration status. , But in a school where 40 percent of students speak a language other than English at home, Locker says fear is palpable., “The academics are one level,” Locker said. ""You can’t get to the academics if the heart and the soul are bleeding. We operate as a family. We’re trying to help people stay safe.”, In February, Boston Public Schools launched a new website called We Dream Together, which features information about immigration rights, a hate crime hotline and scholarship information for undocumented students. College is the brass ring for many newcomers., “We’re selling dreams, we’re telling students it’s achievable,” Locker said. “Now they’re saying it might be too painful to dream because of all this could come crashing down.”, A student who asked to be identified only as Elizabeth says the threat of being deported has never felt more real, but she says living anywhere else is also unimaginable., “We’ve built our life here and we’ve changed in a way to accommodate everything that’s here,” said Elizabeth. “So if we go back, it’s not going to be the same.”, Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

For the week of January 28-February 3, 2017, the report says, ICE issued 3,083 such requests.  ,   The report also appears to represent the first edition of an official public list under the Trump administration of what it calls ""Jurisdictions that have enacted policies which limit cooperation with ICE,"" -- in other words, so-called 'sanctuary' cities and communities. , The list currently features 96 cities, towns, counties and some agencies.

1211,[5 Things You Need To Know About The New England Compounding Center Trial],"[The case against former pharmacist Barry Cadden is now in the hands of a federal jury., Cadden co-owned and ran the New England Compounding Center, the Framingham pharmacy responsible for a nationwide meningitis outbreak in 2012. Contaminated injections produced by the pharmacy killed at least 64 people and sickened more than 700 people., Jurors are now deliberating on whether Cadden is guilty of the 96 charges—including fraud, racketeering and 25 counts of second-degree murder., Here’s what you need to know about the trial and the 2012 outbreak:, 1. What exactly happened in 2012?, In September of 2012, people began to notice a mysterious outbreak of fungal meningitis and other infections in multiple states. This mystified physicians because it’s incredibly rare—and incredibly dangerous. Meningitis is when the membrane around the brain and spinal cord is inflamed., The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)—along with state and local officials—jumped into action. They ultimately traced the deadly outbreak to Cadden’s compounding pharmacy named the New England Compounding Center., His outfit had been shipping out steroid injections that were meant to treat pain. However, they were contaminated with mold. The result was the worst outbreak of meningitis in U.S. history.,  An official from the CDC testified during Cadden’s trial that this meningitis outbreak was comparable to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. However, he said, it was worse because it was entirely preventable., Ebola was huge news back in 2012, but Cadden’s trial has not generated the same media attention. That’s partly because it was fairly technical, delving into concepts such as air sampling and fungal blooms., 2. What happened at the trial? , This was a long trial (more than nine weeks of testimony) and it’s a complicated one (with nearly 100 charges). However, there are two broad issues in the case:, Cleanliness and testing, Federal prosecutors argued that Cadden’s compounding pharmacy flouted safety standards to the point of being downright filthy. In the so-called “cleanroom” where sterile drugs were made, the prosecutors said there were flies, oozing oil, and mold., Under Cadden’s direction, prosecutors said, the pharmacy used expired ingredients, fabricated cleaning logs, and improperly tested the drugs. Prosecutors said Cadden knew his injections could harm or kill patients, yet he still shipped them out. They compared it to a game of Russian Roulette and have charged Cadden with 25 counts of second-degree murder., Cadden’s defense attorneys presented a very different picture. They accept that people died from drugs produced at Cadden’s pharmacy but, they said, this was not a case of murder., Defense attorneys argued that Cadden always sought to go above and beyond best practices for the industry, particularly when it came to cleaning. He used an outside lab for testing and, over the years, his pharmacy sent out hundreds of thousands of medications without incident. They say prosecutors cherry-picked the worst lab results, creating a deceptive picture., But of course, some of the drugs were contaminated with mold. For that, Cadden’s lawyers blame contractors and employees at the pharmacy. In particular, they point to Cadden's business partner, Glenn Chin, who was the supervisory pharmacist and will soon face his own trial., Avoiding regulatory oversight, Federal prosecution argued that Cadden went to great lengths to lie to customers and skirt regulations. They showed the jury a training video in which Cadden dismissed the idea that inspectors would catch up with him., “How can they come in and inspect me?” he asked in the video. “They have no clue what they are looking at. They go around and they’re like: ‘Barry’s place looks great. Yah, I got to go [get a] cup of coffee.’ Really. That is what it is like.”, Prosecutors detailed a complex scheme involving fabricated prescriptions. In an email, Cadden told his employees to make sure bogus patient names did not seem too fake—""No names like Mickey Mouse,"" he wrote., In the training video, an employee asked Cadden about patient names and Cadden responded, “That’s actually one of the more difficult things we do. Let’s just talk about the product now, while we are being recorded.”, By appearing to sell custom-made medications for individual patients, Cadden's outfit fell under state regulation as a retail pharmacy. The goal, prosecutors said, was to hide what was really going on: bulk sales that would have subjected Cadden’s pharmacy to federal oversight as a drug manufacturer., Cadden’s defense attorneys said it was Cadden’s employees and customers who fabricated the prescriptions—not Cadden himself. And, they said, as soon as Cadden knew about problems he acted aggressively and appropriately to fix them. Plus, they pointed to a regulatory landscape that was incredibly murky and showed that lots of compounding pharmacies were struggling to figure out the regulations., 3. Why is Cadden charged with second-degree murder?, Murder is usually decided on the state level, not on the federal level. In this case, the prosecutors listed the second-degree murder counts under their racketeering charges. Federal prosecutors argued that they didn’t need to prove intent to murder. Instead, they said proving Cadden acted with “extreme indifference to human life” was enough., However, Cadden’s defense attorneys want the government to prove intent. During their closing arguments, they told jurors that at the very beginning of the 2012 meningitis outbreak, Cadden spent the night as his pharmacy. He called clinics who had received his drugs and left voicemails warning them to be careful., In one message he said, “We would like you to quarantine this product at this point and call us as soon as possible to discuss the situation. Again, Barry at New England Compounding. We consider this an emergency.”, “Are those the words of a murderer?” asked Cadden’s defense attorneys. They argue that Cadden never intended to kill people, and that prosecutors failed to show exactly what Cadden did to cause the deaths., 4. Separate from Cadden’s trial, what’s been the long-term impact of the outbreak? , First, the victims., Many of the victims who survived the outbreak still have health problems., Kristen Townsley of Alabama is one of them. She has juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and, at the time of the outbreak, she was on a carefully calibrated drug regimen. After receiving three of the contaminated injections, she says, she was barely alive. On her 29th birthday, Townsley was not at home in Alabama. Instead, she was in Minnesota getting treatment at the renowned Mayo Clinic., Now, several years later, she says she’s still in and out of the hospital with medical complications resulting from those injections. She has yet to return to her normal medications for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis., Second, compounding pharmacies., The 2012 outbreak was a wake-up call for the country and for Massachusetts when it came to compounding pharmacies.  , Congress took steps to improve regulations and increase federal oversight. Since the outbreak, 18 states enacted laws that relate to compounding pharmacies, and other states are in the process. However, there's still a lot of variation state by state., In Massachusetts, there is more oversight and more resources for inspections. Yet, it’s worth noting that there’s still not a perfect system. Compounding pharmacies regularly get calls requesting bulk drugs even when they are not supposed to be making medications in bulk, and Massachusetts has been slow to oversee compounded drugs that come from other states but are given to patients here., One more big impact, insurance., According to several pharmacists, insurers have used the 2012 outbreak as an opportunity to reduce their coverage of compounded drugs. So many people’s custom-made medications are now much more expensive. Insurers says these compounded medications are often used unnecessarily and they’re just making sure such medications are only used when absolutely necessary., 5. When the verdict is announced, what happens next?, After the verdict, Cadden awaits his sentencing. His business partner, Glenn Chin, will soon go on trial. He also faces second-degree murder charges., Chin was the supervisory pharmacist, overseeing the pharmacy’s cleanrooms where the drugs were made. Initially, Cadden and Chin were charged together, but because Cadden’s lawyers have tried to blame Chin, they ended up getting separate trials., Cadden’s verdict could inform how the federal prosecutors present their case against Glenn Chin. His trial has not been scheduled yet., Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"
1212,"[Boston's Public Schools Have Adopted A New, More Accurate World Map]","[, There's nothing like a map to help explain the world. But some maps do a better job of it than others., Which is why Boston's public schools have adopted new world maps for some of their classrooms. And, the district claims that it's the first public school system nationwide to make the switch., The new maps replace the traditional, rectangular maps made using the 16th-century Mercator Projection method that was introduced back when Europe ruled — and exploited — much of the world. Mercator world maps emphasize the colonial-era Atlantic Ocean trade routes and distort the relative sizes of continents so that, for example, Greenland appears to be bigger than Africa. (It's not.), Other distortions inherent in the Mercator Projection display a kind of territorial superiority. Simply put, predominantly-white countries are huge seeming, while nonwhite-majority countries are rather small, in comparison., Social studies classrooms in Boston are now getting maps drawn using the Gall-Peters Projection. These maps are designed using configurable, equal-area map projection to display the Earth's surface. In other words, these maps show countries, continents and oceans according to their actual size and location. So, in that sense, they better represent countries (and global cultures) in less developed parts of the world, which tend to be underestimated in many world maps., That's the main reason Boston educators are introducing these maps., “Eighty-six percent of our students are students of color and many, many of them have parents, grandparents that are from places on the map that are underscale or distorted,” says Hayden Frederick-Clarke, the director of cultural proficiency for Boston Public Schools. “We wanted to create the opportunity for the students to see themselves in an appropriate fashion and counter the narrative that many of these places are small, insignificant and not necessarily important to the world and its history, its functions and its glory.”, The most glaring distortion on the Mercator map, says Frederick-Clarke, is the size of Africa. ""Greenland looks about the same size as Africa, the United States looks like it's comparable in size, and we know that is absolutely not true. Africa's 14 times larger than Greenland. In addition to that, Mexico is smaller than Alaska on the Mercator map, that's also quite backwards. Mexico is actually very much larger. There are problems with Brazil. Europe, and more specifically Germany, are near the center of the map, we know that not to be true."", Is North America really bigger than Africa? This map sets things straight https://t.co/vtHMslX9gg via @BostonGlobe, — Tommy Chang (@SuptChang) March 17, 2017, Frederick-Clarke says Boston social studies teachers now have a map that better reflects the reality, and in turn, the diverse student body. “Many of [the students] are from the Caribbean, many are descendants of Africa. We didn't want to tell them, 'Where you are from is small and insignificant.' The marginalization of some of those places in the history books is already a glaring problem, so we didn’t want another add-on.”, He hopes the new maps will help inspire many classroom conversations and shake up the way kids and teenagers see the world., “From my own experience as an instructor, people enjoy the truth, and people, especially classroom teachers, generally want to give the best and most authentic product that they can, and I do not anticipate anything other than surprise and awe and arguably a push to do more of these things to uncover some of the things that we accept as true, but, when we dig a little bit deeper, there’s a more complicated story.”   , But some critics of adopting new maps might look at this initiative as another battle in the culture wars and insist that map, is a map, is a map. No map is perfect, anyway. So, why all the fuss?, To which Frederick-Clarke responds, “When we hang up maps for our students, the navigational utility of the Mercator map does not lend itself to a representation of the world. When our instructors, our schools, hang up maps, we are hanging them up not for our students to sail from Boston to London, we are hanging them up to say this is what the world looks like. With that intention in mind, and with that specific goal, it necessitates that we be truthful and give accurate representations. I can guarantee you that 999 times out of 1,000, these maps are hanging up in classrooms just as depictions of what the world looks like ... sailing is not what we purport to teach kids.”, From PRI's The World ©2016 PRI]"

1215,[Can The Maple Syrup Industry Weather The Effects Of Climate Change?],"[March is Maple Month in Massachusetts, which means it’s typically prime time for sugarhouses across the state to harvest sap and turn it into delicious syrup. But maple farmers say the weather is messing with syrup production as our winters get warmer and shorter. Is this New England tradition at risk? Cristina Quinn has this report., Matfield Maple Farm in West Bridgewater has 800 trees, 1,100 taps and six miles of tubing, creating a super highway of sap. It’s the largest maple farm south of Boston and Rich Forbes has been producing maple syrup here for 25 years, but about seven years ago, he says he started noticing a marked difference in his maple sap flow., “We were going through periods of frozen, periods of warmth and each one works against us,” Forbes said. “The trees stop. They think it’s winter or they think it’s spring.”, He says this stop-and-go behavior makes it much more challenging to predict how much syrup his farm will produce because New England winters are not as long and steady as they used to be. Many maple syrup producers have also noticed lower sugar content in their trees’ sap. If there’s lower sugar content per gallon, that means they need to harvest more sap to make a gallon of syrup., “Everything is different now,"" Forbes said. ""We have these periods of warm-cold extremes.”, While Forbes says the harvest usually evens out by the end of the season, he is one of many maple farmers across New England who say the erratic weather is wreaking havoc on production., Tufts University ecologist Elizabeth Crone may know why. Crone has led research on the decrease of sugar content in maple trees. She says when plants and trees are stressed out, they drop more seeds., “They'll invest more of their resources in producing seeds that can go hopefully to somewhere else where the environmental conditions are better and they'll use fewer of their resources for growing and surviving and defending themselves,"" she said., Think of it as planning for the future — but at a cost to the maple syrup industry., “What we found was that after years where trees produced a lot of seeds there was less sugar in the sap,” Crone said., While Massachusetts is a smaller player in the world of maple syrup production compared to Vermont, it’s an important part of the winter tourism economy. It also provides another stream of income for farmers., Forbes says he’s concerned that global warming will eventually force maple production out of New England., “I think in the future it will move so far north — the maple belt — that it won’t exist,"" he said. ""The belt has been moving for a couple hundred years steadily north. The future doesn’t look good unless we do something to slow it down.

Every kid chosen by lottery regardless of grades, past performance, or special education needs is placed into the same IB curriculum., “Numbers don’t matter,"" Marble said. ""It’s what are the relationships like in the classroom when the teacher believes that everyone can learn at a high level and a high level is individualized. So if a student with special needs can grow, that’s a high level for them.”, , Helping with that relationship is small class sizes. Instead of fancy buildings, Sturgis puts its resources into people. They average around 15 students to every teacher and have a policy of splitting a classroom if it reaches 20., Jessica Lynch is a Special Education Coordinator.

Four hundred staff gone,” Drew said., And that, he said, would impact thousands of the area’s poorest people., “Twenty-five hundred families who have children in all of our Head Start pre-K programs, [ages] zero to five,” he said. “All of the people who now are doing tax returns to help them get their earned income credit, so they can be able to get ahead in life. We have three high schools that we run.”, Trump has also proposed eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which Drew says helps 28,000 low income families in the area pay their heating bills. Drew said he hopes Congress will work to restore funding to those programs., The cuts also include so-called Community Development Block Grants. In Massachusetts, those grants support a program that helps 150 elderly people manage their money and pay their bills., “This is the program that is the bright line between them living in a safe, warm and supportive environment, and them being out on the street, and being homeless, and having to deal with the shelter system, which you can imagine is not very age-friendly,” said Dale Mitchell, CEO of the non-profit group Ethos, which runs the program., Mitchell says Community Development Block Grants fund about 30 percent of the program’s operations, and elimination of that funding would mean laying off staff and setting up a wait list for the program., The proposed budget also includes dramatic cuts to federal research funding that would deeply affect academic institutions., If approved by Congress, it would cut $6 billion from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) — about 20 percent of its funding., ""I think it's incredibly shortsighted,"" said Susan Blanchard, Vice President of Research Administration at Tufts Medical Center, which receives more than half of its annual budget from the NIH., Blanchard says Trump's blueprint is bad news for medical research and the economy., ""The NIH actually is a massive economic engine across the nation ... and I would hope that the administration would carefully consider what the long term consequences of what such a sudden and drastic cut to the NIH budget would do to our nation’s biomedical community,"" she said., The budget would also zero out funding for the National Endowments of the Arts and the Humanities, both of which give millions of dollars to colleges and universities., In a statement released Thursday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said the President's budget ""eliminate[s] hundreds of redundant, overlapping or ineffective programs ... while streamlining and simplifying funding for college and continuing to help make college education more affordable."", Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. , Kirk is the Managing Editor and Correspondent for higher education at WGBH News.

For the last eight years now, they’ve been beating up Obamacare as if it’s just an empty suit, and they didn’t realize that during that time, more and more people from all over the country have been getting health insurance for the first time in their lives,” he said. “I don’t think they heard that part of the discussion because the last several years has been nothing but screaming and political one-liners about Obamacare.”, The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report Monday stating 24 million people would lose coverage if the government replaces the Affordable Care Act with the Republican bill, the American Health Care Act., The Trump administration denounced the CBO’s report, saying it did not take into account other steps in the process of repealing and replacing the ACA., In light of this criticism by the Trump camp, Capuano made a point of clarifying the neutrality of the CBO., “[Republicans] appointed the head of the agency,” said Capuano. “They are considered a neutral nonpartisan agency by everybody. We can disagree with them but no one thinks they put their thumb on the scale.”, Capuano also said moderate Republicans in the House are in a difficult spot after the release of the CBO’s report, as they’re being asked to “vote with the team on a very important bill, and for a bill that they know is first of all, bad, and second of all, going nowhere in the senate.”, FiveThirtyEight says there are plausibly 16 House Republicans who will vote no. Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-Fla.), Leonard Lance (R-N.J.) and Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) have all voiced their oppositions., Capuano said Democrats proposed more than 150 amendments to the American Health Care Act during two committee hearings last week:, “Not a single one of them was accepted,” he said, “and I think that says more about Republicans than it does about Democrats.”, Congressman Michael Capuano is a Democrat, representing the 7th district.

1233,['Reliability' Tops The Ticket At The MBTA's Open House For New Ideas],"[
	MBTA officials held an event last night they dubbed the ""Ideas of March"" to showcase big-picture ideas for the T's future as officials draft a long-term capital plan for what the T will look like in 2040. 
	 
	The  ""Open house,"" as T officials called it was a magnet for transit aficionados, and attendees were asked to place as many of twelve plastic chips they were given at the event's start in a series of jars representing long-term goals for the 'T'.
	 
	The winning jar, as the event wound down, was that representing improved reliability — not, perhaps, a surprise — but it wasn't an overwhelming win, and other priorities fared well.  
	 
	The event itself showcased the diversity of talent and ideas being put into Greater Boston's public transit infrastructure planning. 
	 
	Ideas ranged from improved signage to multi-lingual announcements to improved fare card technologies. 
	 
	And there were not a few advocates of the humble bus. For all the media attention on the MBTA's rail lines, hundreds of thousands of residents in Greater Boston commute not by rail, but by bus. And some transit advocates want to see the humble bus take on a less humble role in public transportation — especially if aided by measures that would make bus transit faster and more reliable. 
	 
	""Part of it's about dedicated space for buses to operate in, part of it's about the stations, part of it's about waiting areas, and fare collection,"" said Ralph DeNisco, ""and a whole bunch of other policies that make the system work better.""

The program costs $15 billion and more than half the money, $9 billion, comes from the federal government., “They talk about block grants or per capita spending,” Pellegrini said. “I think that’s a buzz word for states like Massachusetts that we would probably lose federal funding.”, The Baker administration estimates Mass Health could lose up to $2 billion under the House Republican plan., The Nobles have private insurance that covers the cost of Maddie’s treatment. Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease and she’ll likely require a lifetime of medical interventions. Her parents have done their best to position Maddie so she’ll get the care she needs. , “We’re here in Massachusetts,"" said Nobles.

Currently, 88 districts in Colorado, 43 in Idaho, 30 in Oregon, and nearly half of the districts in Montana have adopted this non-traditional school schedule, according to the Brookings Institute. , The motivation behind this truncated school week is to help save the schools' and districts' money on various operating costs like janitors and heating. An extra 30 to 90 minutes of schooling at the end of each day is meant to supplement the loss of a fifth day., Former Secretary of Education Paul Reville told Boston Public Radio Wednesday his concerns about the increasing popularity of the four-day school week. Reville believes that not only does a four-day week not save money, it is also can be detrimental to a child’s education., “The research is beginning to show that the savings aren’t anything near what was predicted, and yet at the same time, we are leaving a lot of kids in rural communities who don’t have much access to other constructive resources or opportunities in the day with an extra day on their own. I think that’s potentially problematic,” said Reville., Reville thinks the education system should be going in the opposite of shorting the school week and says students would benefit from longer, activity-filled days., “We should be thinking about how we get more time, support, and opportunities to children, many of whose parents are busy working and don’t have other alternatives. I think [four-day school weeks], in fact, are a disturbing trend."", To hear more of our interview with former Secretary of Education Paul Reville click above. , Jason Turesky is an Associate Producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

In city where nearly 80 percent of voters supported Hillary Clinton, few students at New North High School were celebrating. Urquiola and Freeman say some kids stared at them when, along with three other friends, they pulled out a Trump flag., “We found like a wall and we just kind of took a quick picture wearing our Trump hats and holding the flag,” said Freeman., That photo was posted online. And here’s where political disagreement turned into something uglier:   Another student reposted the photo on social media, with photo shopped obscenities above the boys’ heads. Urquiola, who is Jewish, was labeled a Nazi., “I didn’t know that’s how people looked at me just because I like Trump,” said Urquiola. “I know most people in my city don’t like Trump. I didn’t know people looked at me that way, with the nasty words and things they put about me on there.”, When he learned about the photo, Newton North principal Henry Turner sent parents a letter indicating posts targeting students for their political beliefs “will not be tolerated”. But Joe’s father, Ed Urquiola wanted a tougher response. He cites the aftermath of an incident last September, when someone drove by the school waving a confederate flag.,  “The entire school had to go to re-education,” said Ed Urquiola. “When they drove around with the confederate flag, which is an ignorant act, I agree – but it wasn’t targeted at anybody. It wasn’t pointed at a Jewish kid and saying you’re a Nazi because you voted for Trump.”, Robert Trestan, regional director of the Anti -Defamation League says it’s difficult to compare one incident with another.  , “They took action,” said Trestan. “More importantly, they recognized the impact that this online harassment and bullying would have on the school environment.”, He says his office advised Newton in this case and a similar one at another local school. He says in schools across Massachusetts there’s been a dramatic uptick in the casual use of inflammatory language., “Many people are using all sort of analogies, including Nazi and Holocaust analogies,” said Trestan. “Not everyone, including many young people, really have the appropriate context.”, Ed Urquiola, however, thinks the word choice used to target his son reflects a widely held view of President Trump., “To a lot of people here he is a Nazi. That’s why Joe was called a Nazi, a lot of people here believe that,” said Urquiola. “If you really think he’s a Nazi, and I support him, what are you going to think of me? I feel that here.”, That’s tough criticism for a city that prides itself on being tolerant. , “I disavow the idea that there is some kind of undercurrent in Newton that because you voted for Trump you’re not welcome to live here or that I don’t want my kids playing with your kids anything like that,” said Shawn Fitzgibbons, chair of the Newton Democrats.   , He says opposition to the president is strong in Newton, but the photo labeling a teen Trump supporter a Nazi is an anomaly., “These are kids, it’s bullying,” said Fitzgibbons. “The current president’s rhetoric has led kids to add this to their political discourse.”, Joe Urquiola and Cam Freeman say they do talk politics with friends who are not Trump supporters.  What bothers them is that peers who don’t know them are quick to judge., “It’s not a good feeling when there’s people who hate you or don’t want to be your friend who don’t even know you at all,” said Joe Urquiola. “I’ve never even talked to some of these people.”, WGBH’s coverage of K-12 education is made possible with support from the Nellie Mae Education Foundation., Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"
1245,"[A Morning Freeze Will Finish Tuesday's Nasty Storm, Reminding Us That Spring Is Yet To Come]","[Tuesday’s snowstorm failed to fulfill worst-case forecasts, but it was still a nasty piece of work. Density more than compensated for what New England escaped in depth., Because the storm veered off its projected inland course and tracked out to sea, the snowfall was heavy and wet – and later in the afternoon mixed. In other words: a shoveler’s nightmare., Those sensible folks who stayed indoors will have a rude awakening when they set out for work Wednesday morning. A late night freeze will start inland around 9 p.m. and move to the coast by 1 a.m. Expect slippery streets, dangerous sidewalks, and frozen keyholes., By morning, strong winds should have abated. During the storm, gusts of up to 70 mph were recorded along the coast. Barnstable peaked at 74 mph on Cape Cod with Rockport clocking in at 70 on the North Shore., Downed and disabled trees triggered power outages. As many as 52,000 households were without electricity – primarily in eastern Massachusetts. Outages were highest in northeastern Mass., but were significant in central and southeaster parts of the state. Newburyport and Salisbury were the hardest hit. , The town of Southwick, southwest of Springfield in the Connecticut River Valley, registered the deepest accumulation with 14.8 inches. On the other end of the scale, the seaport Salem measured 5 inches., The MBTA, Although the snow began in earnest after the morning commute ended, many stayed home. The MBTA put in a stable performance. With snow flurries starting later than expected, the MBTA subway and commuter rail operated with few delays., Some bus lines were impacted, like the 73 route trackless trolley from Waverly Square to Harvard Square, which was delayed because of a problem with the line's overhead wires., MBTA staff throughout the day concentrated on snow removal. Track clearing occupied T snow removal teams during the day and they prepared for overnight cleanup before the Wednesday morning commuter rush., MBTA Chief Operating Officer Jeff Gonneville said T staff will be preparing the system overnight for when riders return in the morning., ""Tuesday evening into Wednesday morning's commute, we're going to have over 800 employees working,"" Gonneville said., After a disastrous 2015 snow season that saw numerous cancellations and a full shutdown of the subway, the MBTA invested over $100 million to snow-proof the system., The T expects to operate a full subway, bus and Commuter Rail schedule Wednesday., Amtrak, the national passenger rail provider, cancelled service between Boston and New York. Travelers should check for reschedules., Greater Boston, Before the snow started falling, the streets of Boston and its surrounding areas were coated with 4,000 tons of ice. As the snow started and intensified, the city deployed roughly 800 pieces of equipment., , Wednesday, city operations will resume. However, because of concerns about freezing temperatures and icy conditions, Boston Public Schools will be closed for another day., “I would rather err on the side of caution than put our kids in harms way,” said Boston Mayor Walsh., Shelters filled up as homeless individuals sought refuge. Well over 400 people found dry and warmth at the Pine Street Inn. And tonight, the shelter expected that number to double. They anticipate filling all 675 beds and roughly 100 other people will sleep on temporary cots and mats., Barbara Trevisan, spokesperson for Pine Street Inn, says the advanced warning helped shelters stock up on food and prepare additional rooms. , However, she says some people still refuse to come indoors. For them, Pine Street Inn sends out vans with counselors and trained staff., ""They go out equipped with food, coffee, hot chocolate, sandwiches, very warm blankets, warm clothing,"" says Trevisan., She says they are coordinating with the Boston Public Health Commission and other shelters to keep track of everyone who remains on the streets., The Environs, In Marblehead, just before 11 a.m. as the storm began to intensify, two turkeys huddled in a recessed Starbucks storefront. The birds weren't confrontational, as turkeys sometimes are. Instead, they calmly stood as passers-by bound for refreshment snapped pictures and uttered pleasantries., , Inside the shop, a self-important older guy in a hoodie berated the staff for daring to close early. He also complained about the local schools closing, and tried bolsert his argument by proudly announcing that he'd lived through the Blizzard of '78. Everyone ignored him., WGBH reporter Adam Reilly, after learning via Twitter and email, that the storm was being panned as a ""bust,"" drove down to Revere Beach, parked his car, and stood next to the Oak Island Bath House for approximately one minute, capturing video of the high tide., , His report: “It was excruciating. The wind, blowing from the northeast at what felt like extremely high speeds, was excruciating, pummeling me with heavy, sharp nuggets of precipitation that split the difference between snowflakes and sleet. I moaned in agony and nearly fell down; after a minute, tops, I fled to my car. No storm that can take that physical toll that quickly is a bust.” , On the South Shore, things were – well – slushy., , At high tide along the Scituate seawall, overwash led to minor flooding in the usual neighborhoods, Humarock and Surfside Road. Fire trucks and police SUVs slowly made their way through the neighborhoods, surveying the areas for damage. , There was also minor flooding in parts of Hull and slush clung to cars and the backs of homes but fortunately, not to power lines., In Cohasset harbor, weathered lobster boats bobbed up and down enthusiastically but held steady.

1247,[The GOP's Big Health Care Gamble],"[In January, in an interview with the Washington Post, President Donald Trump said he was working on a plan with the goal of “insurance for everybody."", But according to the Congressional Budget Office, the GOP's health care bill would leave 24 millions more without coverage by 2026., ""This proposal unambiguously leaves millions of Americans worse off,"" said MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, who was instrumental in creating Romneycare and the Affordable Care Act., Gruber said Republicans promised the impossible when they told Americans no one would lose insurance coverage under their new plan. That's because the unpopular parts of the Affordable Care Act (like the individual mandate, requiring even young, healthy people to buy insurance) make the popular parts (like preventing discrimination against people with preexisting conditions) work., ""The [Affordable Care Act] is an intricate set of interlocking features that only works together. It's a three-legged stool,"" Gruber explained., ""It starts with preventing discrimination in the insurance market, which is wildly popular for good reason. Before the law, America was the only nation in the world where insurers could say, 'you're sick, I'm not going to give you insurance,'"" he said., ""But you can't end that without bringing healthy people into the pool. You need the mandate to bring the healthy people into the pool,"" he said., But you also can't legally require people to buy a product they fundamentally can't afford. That's where subsidies and Medicaid expansion come in, Gruber said., Remove some of those pieces and you get the GOP's proposal, which does away with the individual mandate but may make insurance coverage inaccessible for millions., ""It's all an intricate system,"" Gruber said. ""Republicans can't pull one leg away from that stool and hope it still stands."", To hear more from Jonathan Gruber, tune in to Boston Public Radio above., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"
1248,[Religious Communities Continue The Long Tradition Of Offering Sanctuary],"[As the Trump administration cracks down on undocumented immigration, religious communities across the country are responding by preparing to shelter people at risk of deportation., In Denver, a congregation is already hosting an undocumented person avoiding immigration enforcement. And the Episcopal church in Los Angeles has declared itself a sanctuary diocese., U.S. immigration officials have a policy of staying away from what are called ""sensitive locations"" — places such as schools, hospitals and places of worship. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesperson says this policy remains in effect under the new administration., On a narrow side street in Cambridge, Mass., music spills out of University Lutheran Church., Inside the front door are rainbow Adirondack chairs. There's a pipe organ in the chapel, and if you head up the back stairs, you'll see a room where there will soon be a trundle bed., Pastor Kari Jo Verhult is converting the Sunday school classrooms of her church to living quarters with the help of a group of nearby Christian and Jewish congregations., ""This is bedding,"" she says. ""So lots and lots of bedding and towels."", With a half-dozen air mattresses and a futon lined up, the church is ready to host undocumented immigrants who fear deportation., Pastor Verhult hopes it will hold. But she says another, older policy comes to mind., She pulls out her Bible., ""OK, so this is the Book of Numbers,"" she says., She flips to the Old Testament., ""You shall designate three cities beyond the Jordan and three cities in the land of Canaan to be cities of refuge,"" she says. ""These six cities shall serve as a refuge for the Israelites. For the resident or transient alien among them."", In these cities, people were beyond the reach of law enforcement., And it wasn't just the Israelites. In ancient Egypt, Rome and Greece, temples were sanctuaries., ""It's a fairly natural progression for Christian churches to claim the same ability to protect fugitives that others had,"" says Karl Shoemaker, a professor at the University of Wisconsin and an expert in the history of sanctuary law., He says for centuries, congregations have provided for those on the run., In America, churches were key stations on the Underground Railroad. And in the 1980s, a network of churches helped people flee wars in Central America., ""These churches are certainly situating themselves within a very long — a 2,000-year-old tradition,"" he says., Just a few blocks from the University Lutheran is the Old Cambridge Baptist Church. It too has a history of sheltering people like Magdalena Rivas., ""And I have in here my bedroom,"" she says. ""I this side. And the people they sleeping with me in the other side."", In 1984, Rivas escaped El Salvador's bloody civil war. She was undocumented, so congregants here took turns staying with her. Beneath big blue stained glass windows, they kept watch for immigration authorities., Rivas says one place in the church was particularly soothing., She peers into the baptismal basin where she used to bathe., ""Your feeling is safe,"" she says. ""Well, you know, you're relaxing. You're both feeling Jesus with you."", It was there, submerged in the waters of the baptistery, that she felt the safest., Rivas eventually received political asylum and citizenship. She says she feels lucky and glad there were houses of worship to shelter her then and so many others today., Copyright 2017 WGBH Radio.

Prosecutors maintain that the alleged extortion was, effectively, a means of advancing the mens’ careers and standing in the city., The response is part of an ongoing back-and-forth as defense lawyers attempt to derail the prosecutions case before it goes to trial. , In today’s filing, Sullivan and Brissette's lawyers argue that the prosecutors' claims don't meet basic definitions of criminal corruption -- or, especially, definitions of corruption that have come from recent supreme court decisions. , In their response to prosecutors today, lawyers for Brissette and Sullivan cited various recent cases that, they argue, have established precedent that curtails the definition of criminal extortion and other kinds of corruption -- among them, a 2013 Supreme Court decision, Sekhar v. United States, that, they argue, made clear that the ""obtaining of property"" is central to the anti-corruption Hobbs Act, under which Brissette and Sullivan are being prosecuted. , ""In the absence of any allegation that Defendants themselves 'obtained' the wages and benefits at issue,"" lawyers for Sullivan and Brissettte wrote in a joint response, ""the charging documents fail to allege a Hobbs Act violation."", The response also challenges characterizations by prosecutors that Brissette and Sullivan used threats and intimidation against the festival organizers, pointing out that the prosecution has not, so far at least, pointed to specific verbal threats made by either defendant. , Read the full filing here:,  , Brissette Sullivan Filing 3-10-17 by isaiah.thompson4452 on Scribd,  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
1261,[Massachusetts Faces A Dam Problem],"[The Shawsheen River runs gently but steadily through Andover, twisting around rocks. But just downstream there's a lot of action. An excavator on the banks of the river picks up rocks from a pile and drops them in the sediment. The crew here will top the rocks with soil in an effort to restore this riverbank., Until just a few weeks ago, there was a dam here., “It was attached to these two buildings here,"" Bill Bennett, a biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, explains at he points out the old sluiceway once used to lower the water level., Thousands of aging dams like this one block rivers and streams across Massachusetts. Long past their prime, the dams damage ecosystems and could lead to dangerous flooding if they fail. Now, an effort is underway to remove some of them., The state got a four and a half million-dollar federal grant to remove the Andover dam, which was built in the 1770s to power a woolen mill, and eight others considered high-risk. Bennett says there are about three thousand dams on Massachusetts rivers that no longer serve any functional purpose., Click on the dots below to learn about conditions at individual dams in Massachusetts that could pose a risk if they fail., , “And so a lot of these dams were built to kind of harvest the power of our rivers, but then those industries go away,"" Bennett says. ""But the dams are left behind.”, These dams can be a real barrier to fish swimming down river, according to Bennett. Before this dam — and a lot of others — were built on the Shawsheen, the river used to be home to herring, American eel, American shad, and Atlantic salmon. Restoring that lost ecology is one of the key reasons work is underway to remove some of the state’s 3,000 obsolete dams., Safety is another reason. Tim Purinton is the director of the state’s Division of Ecological Restoration. He remembers 2005, when the wooden top of a dam on the Mill River in Taunton began to buckle. “The worry was it was going to be a catastrophic breach and create an inundation zone, a flooding zone downstream,"" he says. ""Like a wall of water.”, Residents of Taunton were evacuated from the area that would flood if the dam failed. Fortunately, they managed to stop the failure and have since removed the dam. , “It was a wake-up call for Massachusetts, and it really put an emphasis on the need for looking at our infrastructure,"" Purinton says., After that, state officials started going around checking the strength of dams and requiring that dangerous ones be fixed or removed., About 950 dams could pose a risk to people or property downstream if they fail. Of those, 229 got a poor or unsatisfactory rating in their most recent inspection — meaning they’re somehow deficient even under normal conditions., One of the dams under scrutiny is in the Roberts Meadow Brooke in Northampton., “We own the dam, and we have a responsibility to meet the requirements that are being imposed upon us by the state,"" Northampton Mayor David Narkewicz says. ""The state is not providing us funding to repair dams. They’re basically telling us that we have to either repair it or remove it. And so we believe that the best course of action is to remove the dam.”, Not everyone in town agrees. ""We wanted to see it stay. It’s been there since 1883,” says John Clapp, who has lived in Northampton his whole life. Clapp loves the reservoir the dam created. “You go down, sit there, you can watch all kinds of wildlife — and the ducks and the blue herons, and we’ve seen many otters, many times on the ice feeding on fish. It’s just a beautiful spot.”, For years, Clapp and others in town have been fighting the plan to demolish the dam, worried that it would drain most of that reservoir and potentially contaminate the river with sediment., It’s not easy to remove a dam. In Northampton and many other towns, it’s meant years of ecological and hydrological studies, heated public hearings, regulatory hurdles, and a significant financial investment., Tim Purinton of the state Division of Ecological Restoration acknowledged there’s a lot more work still to be done to remove and repair all the dams that need it., “ We’ll get there,"" he said. ""I mean, it’s going to take a while, but I can say we’re putting a really strong college try towards it.”, In the meantime, they’re going to be watching closely this spring to see what fish make it upstream of where they just removed the dam in Andover, for the first time in nearly 250 years., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

	The Allied War Veterans Council of South Boston, organizers of the city's annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, is set to hold an emergency meeting Friday to decide whether a gay veterans group, OUTVETS, should be allowed to march. It comes days after an initial vote to deny OUTVETS' application to march.
	 
	The Council says that OUTVETS' display of the gay pride rainbow on their banner violates the parade's code of conduct. This despite the fact that OUTVETS was allowed to march in the parade last year and the year before.
	 
	Bryan Bishop is the director of OUTVETS. He spoke with WGBH All Things Considered host Barbara Howard about why his group's application to march was denied and what that means for gay veterans. 
	 ,  OutVets is not out to make a political statement. All we're saying is that we marched in this parade successfully, professionally for two years. The parade organizers told me we never had a problem with you you always marched in a professional manner. You looked great, you were respectful, you were dignified. And my response to that was 'Then what is your problem?"" And he said, ""It's the rainbow."" And they told us if you take that off, we'll let you march. Basically, saying take off your identity, take off your logo and we'll let you march and that's unacceptable. This is just one part of the identity of OutVets.

We were placed between a substance abuse organization and a group of kids on mini bikes. We actually discussed going home at that point. But what we did say which made us go ahead and do it was that we're here to represent veterans we're here to honor the service sacrifice of not only LGBTQ veterans but all veterans, and for us to turn around and walk away now while ti might play well in the media it takes us away from what our mission is. so we proudly marched in that parade we were well received by the people who were there., Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"

1271,[Inside One Of The Highway System's Great Mysteries: Weigh Stations ],"[This story idea came to the Curiosity Desk from listener Ellen Cosgrove in Foxboro, MA., I was wondering about the weigh stations I see on highways. I often see them, and they're always closed. Why do they exist? I was wondering if you could shed some light on it., On a recent morning, I visited the weigh station along Interstate 95 northbound in Rowley, Massachusetts, where I met up with Lieutenant Tom Fitzgerald, head of the Massachusetts State Police Commercial Vehicle Enforcement Unit., Shortly after my arrival, Fitzerald opened the weigh station with the simple flip of a switch that changed a sign on the highway to read ""open."" And whenever that sign says ""open,"" every commercial truck on the highway is required to pull in. Within seconds, that's exactly what started happening. , Just as the name suggests, state troopers in the weigh station really do weigh commercial trucks. Federal law restricts most big rigs to 80,000 pounds. That number is not random, as Fitzgerald explained., ""All the bridges are designed, basically, throughout the country to have a maximum acceptable weight of 800 pounds of tire pressure per square inch, so the weight laws are federal,"" he said., But it’s up to the states to enforce them. Some states have big, fixed scales and weigh every truck. In Massachusetts, the weigh stations looks more like big parking lots. Troopers like Steve Browning watch closely as the trucks parade slowly by, looking for clues that one may be carrying too much of a load., , ""Once you’ve done it for a long time ... you can tell who's loaded,"" Browning said. ""Sometimes you can look at the tires, how the truck rides. There’s a lot of indicators on heavy weight."", As Browning was explaining the process to me, a large flatbed packed high with lumber caught his eye, and he flagged the truck to be weighed.  , I climbed into the cab of the truck in question as driver David Tracey, from Mercer, Maine, awaited his fate. , ""Well. it is part of the business,"" Tracey said. ""‘Course it is a pain, ‘cause it cuts into an already tight schedule to begin with. But I understand it’s about safety. You do see some sketchy stuff on the roads."", , The weigh-up is a fairly low-tech affair. The troopers had Tracy roll forward onto small mobile scales and recorded the weight. Once they weighed each set of tires on the truck, they simply added it all up. , And was Tracey worried that he was overweight?, ""I’m usually right around where I need to be. I mean, there’s a chance; I’m pretty close,"" he said., The fines get more expensive the more overweight a truck is. At 1,000 pounds over, the fine is just $40. But 10,000 over will cost you $800, and 20,000 over will cost $1,600., Crucially, police here do more than just weigh trucks. Think of the troopers as a roving inspection team. They’re cross-trained on more than a hundred safety laws commercial vehicles must comply with. A truck could get checked for violating any of them, from suspension systems in disrepair to an out-of-date registration to what happened to one truck driver whose rig was also flagged to be weighed: , ""Just like that, we start with a weight enforcement and now we find marijuana in the truck,"" Browning explained as he walked toward me holding a Newport cigarette pack containing a small amount of weed. ""Even though it’s legal in Mass., it’s not legal in the truck. So, his truck will get towed, he’ll be out of service. That’s kind of how it escalates."", , Fitzgerald’s unit is 29 strong, and they’re out weighing trucks five days a week. So why is it that weigh stations never seem to be open?, For starters, there’s a dozen of them in the state. On any given day, chances are the team’s not working one near you. Plus, they avoid opening the stations when most of us are actually on the roads., ""One of the issues with the weigh station is the volume of traffic,"" Fitzgerald explained. ""So right now, they’re almost backed out onto the highway. We can’t have an accident, so now we have to pull everything through. This is why we’re not out during rush hour."", Fitzgerald's unit has one goal, he says, plain and simple: to keep the roads — and the people on them — safe., ""It’s not about numbers; it’s about being effective,"" he said. ""We have the lowest commercial vehicle crash fatality rate in the United States. And we’ve had it for the last 10 years, because we focus on prolific violators — stuff that’s seriously, seriously wrong. We’re not looking for rigid technical compliance with all of the laws."", Fitzgerald calls his approach “strict but fair“ and says that he’s learned that, in this job, a little dash of empathy can go a long way., ""The thing about the truck drivers is they’re great people,"" he explained ""They’re just workin’ folk, and they’re just like us. And if they’re treated fairly and they’re treated decently, they’re real easy to get along with."", For trucker David Tracey, that sentiment is mutual. , ""These guys are pretty friendly for the most part,"" he said about the weigh station troopers. ""You treat them with a good attitude, and they’ll generally treat you the same way."", And how did Tracey's weigh-up turn out?, ""He was ... just over 78,000 pounds, so he’s under the 80,000 — so he’s good to go,"" Browning said.  , ""It’s always good to hear,"" said a smiling Tracey as he pulled away. , Our thanks to Ellen Cosgrove in Foxboro for the question that led to this story.

So should these speakers have been heard? Or should a segment of a college community be able to veto a voice? Civil liberties attorney Harvey Silverglate; professor of sociology and women’s studies at Wheelock College, Gail Dines; and Lee Pelton, president of Emerson College joined Jim Braude  (@jimbraude) to discuss., “If somebody can’t state a controversial view on a liberal arts campus, then it’s not a liberal arts campus,” said Silverglate, adding the students ""have a right to speech, but they don’t have a right to stop him [Murray] from speaking.”, “The hallmark of free speech is not to protect comfortable speech,” agreed Pelton—a statement Dines took a step further in her assertion that it is the job of colleges, universities and their professors not just to promote diversity of speech and perspectives, but also to guide students through these conversations and “engage them in intellectual curiosity.”, Dines did, however, draw the line at Milo Yiannopoulos, who she said she would not want to see on a college campus because he incites others. “I think he comes in… to incite racial hatred, to incite homophobia, to incite misogyny,” she said., When questioned as to whether she would bar President Donald Trump from a campus, given many people have leveled the same arguments against him, Dines responded, “I wouldn’t bar him, but I would certainly love to have classes all around discussing exactly his views and what fake news looks like and how he got elected.”, Pelton disagreed on this point, saying the main issue for him is not “emotional safety,” but physical safety for all parties involved. “I think that any provocateur, whether it’s the left or the right should be, under most circumstances, allowed to speak,” said Pelton. “If you invite someone to campus and it’s clear that their presence on campus is going to create some kind of disruption that you cannot prepare for, then you might make a decision [to cancel], but that’s not about that person speaking.”, “Once you start making an exception, ultimately the exception overcomes the rule,” countered Silverglate., On the issue of how far an institution or its professors should push its students, the three fiercely disagreed. While Pelton argued “the best learning occurs from a place of discomfort,” Dines raised the concern that “there’s a line you cross with discomfort where you can actually traumatize your students.” At that point, according to Dines, the students shut down and are no longer able to learn., “Higher education is traumatizing,” responded Silverglate. “Everything they [students] have learned up until the time they get to college gets challenged. Some people consider that traumatizing. If it really is traumatizing, they should quit.”,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ]"

1291,[Scant Discipline Follows Prosecutors’ Impropriety In Massachusetts ],"[In 2012, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court found ""egregious prosecutorial misconduct"" after an assistant district attorney withheld evidence a judge had ordered him to produce for the defense of a boy accused of statutory rape.,  The court decided to uphold a ruling dismissing charges against the defendant, a juvenile at the time of the alleged offense identified only as ""Washington W."" The justices didn't name his prosecutor, David Omiunu, whom WGBH News's investigative reporting partner, The Eye, identified from other court records.,  No reprimand of Omiunu could be found in the public files of the Board of Bar Overseers, the state body responsible for disciplining lawyers. He remains a prosecutor in the Norfolk County District Attorney's Office, whose spokesman said Omiunu made a procedural error in the case and eventually produced the information the court sought., The Washington W. case is one of many in Massachusetts where findings of prosecutorial misdeeds or missteps were made without apparent consequence for the prosecutors, according to a review of more than three decades of Appeals Court and Supreme Judicial Court decisions.  , As reported earlier, The Eye examined over 1,000 rulings in cases where defendants alleged prosecutorial misconduct from 1985 through last April. That investigation found that the Supreme Judicial Court and Appeals Court had reversed convictions at least 120 times in whole or in part because of prosecutors’ misconduct or error.,  Further review of court rulings and Board of Bar Overseers' proceedings has found:, Misconduct Defined, Under a legal standard often cited by judges, a prosecutor’ misstep warrants a reversal when it is ""prejudicial"" against the defendant, meaning that jurors who reached a guilty verdict might have decided on acquittal if the prosecutor hadn't stepped out of line. The rules governing lawyers in Massachusetts give several definitions for ""professional misconduct,"" including ""conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice."", The Massachusetts record fits a national pattern in which ""prosecutors often act above the law and are not held accountable by state and local disciplinary boards,"" said Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University who has studied the criminal appeals process. ""There is little excuse for neglecting to take action in the face of an appellate finding of egregious misconduct."", Asked about the seeming disconnect between judicial findings of impropriety and its discipline of prosecutors, the Board of Bar Overseers declined to comment. Constance Vecchione, who investigates allegations against attorneys as head of the Office of the Bar Counsel, said there are many difficulties ""inherent in a disciplinary prosecution of a prosecutor, including the age of the underlying events by the time the misconduct issue is raised."", The two state courts ascribed many of the conviction reversals to prosecutors' improper arguments, remarks or questions at trial. Justices have also found rarer missteps like withholding evidence, improper rejections of jurors based on race or ethnicity, or violating a trial judge’s orders., Improper closings are the most common fault, according to the decision history. Courts draw strict limits against suggestions that defendants are guilty simply because they didn't testify — a right protected by the U.S. Constitution. Judges also take a dim view of prosecutors who misstate evidence or use overly-inflammatory emotional appeals., A Future AG Stumbles, In one reversal, the Supreme Judicial Court awarded a new trial in 1995 to a man convicted of raping a 4-year-old, in a case prosecuted by Martha Coakley, then an assistant district attorney. Voters later elected Coakley district attorney for Middlesex County, and still later made her attorney general.   , Both of the state’s top courts determined Coakley twice misstated evidence in her closing argument in the rape case, including by stating that the defendant masturbated in front of the alleged victim. The SJC ruled this was unsupported by evidence and put the defendant in an unfavorable light for the jury., Coakley said in an interview that she thought her remark was based on reasonable inferences from evidence and testimony. After being granted a new trial, the defendant pleaded guilty to an assault charge and was released on time served and probation, according to court records., ""I've always prided myself — both as an assistant district attorney and as D.A. — on being fair. Sometimes the courts reach a different conclusion,"" Coakley said. Now of counsel at the Boston law firm Foley Hoag, she acknowledged at the time of the appeal that another statement regarding the whereabouts of potential witnesses to the alleged crime — which the appeals courts deemed ""pure speculation"" — was an error. , Daniel Ford, one of the prosecutors who was reversed and later became a judge, argued the commonwealth's case against Bernard Baran, convicted of child molestation in 1985. After Baran spent more than 20 years in prison, the Appeals Court agreed to grant him a new trial., Although the new-trial ruling was based on a finding that Baran had received an inadequate defense, the appeals decision said the prosecutor’s closing argument contained ""toxic"" errors and statements ""apparently designed to inflame the jurors' passions."" It also said ""there are indications"" that the prosecution deliberately withheld evidence favorable to Baran, including unedited interview tapes in which the child witnesses may have been coached., Ford described the defendant, a teacher's assistant at a Pittsfield day-care center at the time of his arrest, as a “chocoholic in a candy store” who “could have raped and sodomized and abused those children whenever he felt the primitive urge to satisfy his sexual appetite.”, Baran was freed in May 2009, and the Berkshire County District Attorney's Office declined to bring charges against him again. He died in September 2014. Ford is currently a Superior Court judge., John Egan, an attorney for Ford, disputed the court's findings and directed The Eye to a 2014 letter that appeared in The Boston Globe about the case. In the letter, Egan said Ford's conduct “has been thoroughly reviewed and found to be fully consistent with the ethical responsibilities of a prosecutor in 1985."" In an interview, Egan said the Office of Bar Counsel initiated an investigation and found no violation against Ford., Far Afield, In 2002, the same year Judge Robert Tochka was appointed to the bench, the Supreme Judicial Court threw out one of his cases for misstating testimony in closing arguments. Tochka “strayed far afield from the evidence” in a 1997 murder trial, according to the court's decision. Tochka, who was appointed to the state Commission on Judicial Conduct in 2014, did not respond to requests for comment.  , In a case often cited in subsequent court rulings on prosecutors, both the Appeals Court and the SJC found that Howard Whitehead, then an assistant district attorney, made remarks about the defendant not grounded in the evidence., Whitehead suggested that the defendant, accused of stabbing an elderly man, might have been a prostitute based on a jar of Vaseline found in her purse, and dwelled on her knowledge of jello wrestling with an “apparent goal” of painting her “as a promiscuous woman,” the Appeals Court said, in reversing the verdict., “None of this was proper. All of it was prejudicial,” the Supreme Judicial Court determined. The SJC ruling said Whitehead had not argued “in an egregious way.”, Whitehead said he believes he argued the evidence appropriately in the case and had never been contacted by the state bar overseers. After more than 15 years as a prosecutor in Middlesex and Essex counties, he was appointed to the Superior Court bench in 1993 and retired in 2014. He is now special counsel to the Middlesex County District Attorney’s Office., The SJC reversed a first-degree murder case in 2008 because the prosecutor's closing argument was “replete with prejudicial improprieties.” Afterwards, the state bar overseers reprimanded the prosecutor, Robert Nelson Jr., Nelson saw another case reversed in 2013 because he characterized the defendant as a “street thug,” the entire defense as a “sham,” and the defense attorney as a liar. The SJC determined that Nelson's “insulting names” were “designed to evoke an emotional, rather than a rational, response from jurors.”, Nelson, who retired as a Norfolk County prosecutor in 2012, did not return inquiries., The state's top courts have criticized prosecutors for crossing the line every year since 1980. Last year, the courts handed down at least eight decisions citing prosecutors' improper closing arguments as grounds for reversal. In one of three reversals this year, the Supreme Judicial Court found that a prosecutor resorted to impermissible profiling by emphasizing the defendant's appearance to convince jurors he was a drug dealer rather than an addict., “Why is it that the commonwealth consistently tries to use this kind of evidence?” asked SJC Justice Geraldine Hines at oral arguments last fall. A body of rulings that such “obviously prejudicial” evidence is impermissible “just doesn't seem to be changing the way prosecutors do business,” Hines said., Willful And Repeated , In the 2012 ruling in the case prosecuted by Omiunu, the court dismissed the indictments against the juvenile defendant and barred the commonwealth from filing similar charges against him in the future., The defendant, “Washington W.,” was charged with statutory rape of a teenage male in fall 2007. Contending he was being prosecuted selectively based on his sexual orientation, he successfully argued for an order from the Juvenile Court instructing the state to produce data comparing the prosecution of juveniles for heterosexual versus homosexual acts., Omiunu brought the data to a subsequent hearing but refused to give it to the defendant. The judge said she was dismissing the charges due to the “commonwealth's willful and repeated failure to comply with discovery orders.”, A spokesperson for the district attorney said Omiunu should have filed a motion to vacate the judge's discovery order rather than refuse to produce the information, and that the requested data was eventually provided. Omiunu has served in Norfolk County since 2001.]"
1292,[Hundreds Rally Against Proposed Planned Parenthood Cuts],"[Hundreds of people carrying signs and wearing pink flooded Boston Common Saturday morning in support of Planned Parenthood., “Our rights are under attack,” said Boston City Councilor-at-large Ayanna Pressley to the protesters. “Defunding Planned Parenthood will unleash a tsunami of hurt.”, Pressley was just one of a dozen lawmakers, activists and public officials who spoke at Saturday’s rally, including U.S Representatives Seth Moulton, Joe Kennedy, and Katherine Clark, as well as Mayor Marty Walsh., “There’s confusion in Washington: March is Women’s History Month and they think that means they’re going to try and turn the clock back on us,” Rep. Clark said to the crowd. “But they are not going to do that because we have you ... we understand that when women get to make decisions for themselves, that is the country we want to live in.”, , The Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts organized the rally in response to a leaked federal proposal that pledges to defund Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. Massachusetts’ five clinics may lose approximately $2 million in Medicaid reimbursements if the proposal becomes law., Gov. Charlie Baker said on Friday he would supplement state funds if those federal dollars are cut., Protester Amber Hall said although she feels lucky to live in a state where many public officials support Planned Parenthood and its services, she knows other people aren’t as fortunate., “Even though I live in a state where I have a lot more access to these things and we have a governor who’s expressed that he will make sure planned parenthood stays open, I’m here to stand up for other people who will not have that right if Planned Parenthood is defunded,” Hall said. “And as an educator, I work in a public school with a lot of people who may rely on care like this, so I’m here for the people who need Planned Parenthood to stay open.”, Alongside public officials, activists and patients of Planned Parenthood spoke at the rally, including Christian Kaufman. Kaufman – now a Planned Parenthood health center staff member – spoke of the first time she used Planned Parenthood services., , Several years ago, she lived in Texas, where she bartended to pay the bills. With little in the bank, she could barely afford rent, let alone a doctor. When she did become sick, she turned to Planned Parenthood where she received a free checkup and antibiotics., Kaufman encouraged men and women to begin sharing their own stories about the importance of Planned Parenthood in their lives., “Now is the time to speak out about what [Planned Parenthood] means to you,” Kaufman said. “When we stand up to those who want to defund Planned Parenthood, we’re standing up for patients just like me when I was at my most vulnerable. Patients who might not have much money in the bank who need safe, reputable, full spectrum, non-judgmental care. We’re standing up for them.”]"

That's exactly what Erica Max, program director of the Wakefield Estate, did, when she noticed that Prince Peep, a Malaysian Serama rooster, started shivering when the temperature dropped., “I discovered that Serama roosters, you know, normally would live very close to the equator, and they are not well suited to this climate, in New England.” Max said., So Max called up Nancy Kearns, who lives at Fuller Village, a retirement community across the street, and asked her if she and her knitting group could help Prince Peep., “I said, let's give it a try,” Kearns said. “So I went online. There's a very wonderful site called Pinterest. I just typed in the words ""chicken sweater,"" and I found a pattern from England.”, These ladies do a lot of knitting for charities like Project Linus, a nationwide organization that donates homemade blankets to sick children, so knitting for chickens was a departure for them — and it came with a lot of trial and error., “Because the pattern really was for big chickens,” said Kearns. “And Prince Peep, in particular, is a miniature.”, Weighing in at roughly one pound, he’s certainly diminutive. But what didn’t fit Prince Peep looked tailor-made for the larger hens. And it worked out perfectly since many of them were molting, making them more vulnerable to the elements., On this particular day, Erica Max couldn’t find Prince Peep’s sweater — it’s so tiny that it’s easy to misplace — so we found another easygoing chicken to try one on. As it turns out, putting a sweater on a chicken is a two-person job. Fortunately, the lovely white hen worked with us as we pulled a rainbow-colored sweater vest over her head and fastened it under her wings., After we laid her down onto the ground, she moseyed on over to the other chickens hanging outside the coop.

That's more than double the number of overdose deaths from just four years ago. With overdoses on the rise, community members, including healthcare workers, are looking for ways to stem the opioid epidemic., Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital is one of the hospitals in the area that is rethinking their policies on prescribing opioids to manage patient pain., Dr. Sarah Wakeman is a primary care physician at MGH and co-chair of the hospital's opioid task force. She spoke with host Barbara Howard about alternatives to opioids when it comes to pain management., Some of the main points Dr. Wakeman touched on were whether hospitals typically screen for a history of addiction before prescribing opioids, and whether there's a need for a culture shift in seeing opioids as the go-to drug for pain., ""Many hospitals still don't screen for substance use universally,"" Wakeman said. ""Mass. General — actually several years ago — began screening all inpatients for alcohol and drug use."", She also discussed the cultural differences between the U.S. and other countries when it comes to pain medication. For instance, in countries around Europe, the go-to medication to treat pain after surgery is Tylenol, whereas here, doctors immediately opt for opioids to kill pain., ""I think we need to reeducate patients that we're not going to be able to get pain to go away entirely, that we want to be treating people with compassion and managing their pain as best they can,"" Wakeman said. ""But, we need to always be weighing the risks and benefits of a given therapy and really starting with less intensive therapies first and really only escalating for people who really need more aggressive pain relief."" , Wakeman added that aggressively treating pain is a priority for doctors because if patients report still being in pain upon their release from the hospital, it could negatively affect a hospital's reputation and finances., ""Patients are surveyed after they leave the hospital,"" Wakeman said. ""They're asked about how well their pain was controlled during their hospital stay, so that becomes one of the measures that hospitals are rated on and it's linked to reimbursement in some cases."" , To listen to the entire interview with Dr. Wakeman, click on the audio player above.]"

Baker’s death highlights the dangers of addiction, even after a successful recovery., Dr. James Baker said his son Max was the kind of kid who took to classic literature at a young age. He was “reading Nabokov and Homer, and a very studious person,” said the elder Baker., , But his passion was playing the drums., “He’d be on the kit with his tongue out all the time,” said Max’s best friend and bass player, Ryan Clark. “He’d hit the drums really hard. He looked like a super hero.”, But that started to change. He said Max started smoking pot, and quickly moved on to pain pills. By the time he was 17, Max was regularly using heroin. Clark said it was obvious when he’d go to Max’s place to play music together. Sometimes he couldn’t focus, and would just keep starting a song over and over again. Or they’d start playing, and Max would just fall asleep at the drum kit., “It was really frustrating,"" Clark said. ""I was like, ‘why would you even invite me over?’ you know?” , After a while, they just stopped playing. Max’s life basically fell apart. He dropped out of high school. His dad, who’s a physician, said he could see in Max’s pupils and skin tone the signs that his son was on opioids, and begged him to stop., “He would have slurred speech, and be nodding off at the dinner table,"" he said. ""And we’d go to a concert together and he would disappear and come back acting differently.”, Max tried to stop on his own, but he’d start again when he got the withdrawal symptoms. Eventually, his father realized he was enabling Max by letting him live with him. So just before his son’s 21st birthday, he wound up doing something unbelievably hard — he kicked Max out of the house. Incredibly, it worked., “He got started in a detox program, then to a suboxone treatment program and was on his way to — took about a year to get clean of everything, including the suboxone,"" he said. ""And then he was sober and himself again.”, Max got his G.E.D., and then an associate’s degree., “He called me just a few days before Christmas in 2014,” Max's father said., “I just wanted to touch base with you, and also I wanted to let you know that I got a job,"" Max said in the message. ""So if you can call me back, that would be great. Alright, thanks. Love you.”, “It didn’t matter to him if he was washing dishes or delivering pizza,"" Dr. Baker said. ""He was working.” , , And it was about this time Max met Emma Hargraves.  , “He was the love of my life,"" Hargraves said. ""I was going to marry him.”, On their first date, Max told Emma about some of the crazy and awful things he’d been through.,  “He was very upfront about his past,"" she said. ""But this past year, at the end he was really strong and really going places.”, Max enrolled in UMass Lowell, where Emma was a student, and started taking classes. He’d decided he wanted to be a doctor, like his father. And he and Clark started playing music together again. After everything he’d been through, by all accounts, Max was a success story. He managed to get into recovery and get his life back on track. Then, one day as he drove home from a class, one moment derailed everything.,  “A young teenage girl didn’t see him and just pulled out in front of him, and they had a major accident,” said Dr. Baker., Max’s injuries included a broken bone in his hand that required surgery. He talked about his addiction with his surgeon, Dr. James Shenko, and about his fear it might cause a relapse., “So the conversation was, can we minimize that?"" said Shenko. ""And it became a big discussion between myself and anesthesia between, they were uncomfortable treating this patient differently than other patients because they felt that wasn’t fair to the patient.”, He said journal articles suggested patients on addiction recovery meds like methadone were usually OK after surgery, unless they were not given drugs for pain. But Max wasn’t on anything like methadone anymore, so the best option wasn’t as clear. They wound up using the normal drug cocktail for the surgery, including opioids. The surgery went well, but afterwards, Max’s father said he confronted Dr. Shenko., “And said, ‘I need medicine for this pain. I need real medicine,’"" Dr. Baker said. ""And the doctor took me aside, I can tell you he had mist in his eyes, he put his arm around me, said, ‘I don’t know what to do, Jim.’”, “It was horrible,"" said Dr. Shenko. ""Because you’re a doctor, you don’t want people to be in pain, but my fear is this kid is going to go back to — his life is going to be altered because of what we’re doing, in a bad way.”, But if he didn’t give Max the drugs, “I think he would have said, ‘I’m going to take matters into my own hand. Absolutely.”, , In the end, Dr. Shenko prescribed just a small amount of Vicodin, an opioid. Less than a month later, Max’s father got a call saying Max had been found unconscious at his mother’s house. Before he could even get there, he got another call telling him his son was dead. When he got there, the police wouldn’t let him upstairs where Max was., “And they said, did he have a problem with drugs?,"" Dr. Baker recalled. ""And I said yes, he did, but he was recovering.”, Max died of a heroin overdose. He was 23 years old. Dr. Baker called Emma.,  “And I instantly was like ‘what are you talking about? That’s impossible,’"" she said. ""I always knew that dating Max and falling in love with him that this was a possibility, but he just got exponentially better. And it’s like it doesn’t make sense.”, Dr. Shenko, the hand surgeon, said ever since he found out about what happened, he’s been going over and over the decision to give Max medication., “It’s still ... I can’t put an answer on it. What could you have done differently, what do you change, how do you do something differently, how do you treat patients like this?” he asked rhetorically., , Max’s father, a physician who also prescribes opioids, has been suffering over it, too., “That’s — at least for me — yet to be sorted out,"" he said. ""And as I’ve gone through the literature, which I do every day now, I get up 3 or 4 in the morning and I study, study, study, try to learn more about this, about safe prescribing, about the different medications that are available here and in other countries, what can be done?”, He’s learned, he said, that there’s just no clear cut answer. He’s now getting certified to prescribe suboxone, the drug that initially got his son off heroin. And he’s taken a course on safe prescriptions of opioids in the hopes of preventing more tragedies like the one in his family.  , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

1314,[Welcome To Ye Olde Thai Consulate ],"[The first thing you see when you walk into the restaurant is a massive tank, full of lobsters. The air is thick with Boston accents and the smell of America’s favorite steamed crustacean. And, of course, the sound of oysters being shucked., Union Oyster House is one of the oldest restaurants in United States. People have been coming here for clam chowder and baked beans for more than 300 years., Now, they also come here for visas. Thai visas, to be exact. All thanks to a man named Joe Milano., Milano is the owner of Union Oyster House. He also happens to be the honorary consul general for Thailand., It all started when Milano – a lifelong Bostonian – learned that the old King of Thailand was born in Mount Auburn Hospital. He thought the king deserved recognition, and Boston’s royal connections should be celebrated., “I put together a resolution to have a square named after the king,” Milano explained. “And the rest was history.”, The square was a hit. Located right in the heart of Harvard Square, across from the Kennedy School, the space quickly became a point of pilgrimage for visiting Thais. Overnight, Milano transformed into a celebrated, if mysterious, figure in Thailand. He became a go-to figure for local Thai events, and when the previous consul general stepped down in 2001, Milano was tapped to fill the position.  , To get to the consulate, you have to walk through the restaurant. Murals of old Boston cover the walls. A sign hangs over the bar, announcing that Daniel Webster used to drink there., Then, up another flight of stairs, and into the consulate., Milano’s office is choc-a-block full of memorabilia, a mish-mash of old school yankee-dom, and a fancy Thai office. He has carved elephants, baseballs, photos of both Thai and American politicians. A teak desk sits rooted in the middle of the room., For countries who don’t want to pay for embassies in smaller cities, honorary consulates are a great option. They process visas, help travelers and expats who might have run into trouble, and go to local, cultural functions.  , Milano’s consulate is small, and rarely deals with major issues. Milano doesn’t think he’s ever had to deal with a travel emergency, and if the royal family visits Boston, the U.S. State Department handles the preparations., But the position is no joke., If you want to go to Thailand for business or to visit for more than 30 days, you’ve got to go through Milano. He says his office hands out 12 to 13 hundred visas a year., When I ask Milano why he does it, he says first and foremost, that he loves the country. But he admits to something else: “I like the theater.”, Once in a while, Milano escorts a royal, or meets a big politico, or visits the palace in Thailand. During those times, he’s a glittering elite. He’s on the international stage, even if playing a bit part., The rest of the time, he’s in his office, stamping visas. And that suits him just fine, too., Caroline Lester is a producer for WGBH and PRI’s Innovation Hub. You can follow her @caro_ohlivia , Caroline Lester is an Associate Producer for Innovation Hub. ]"

1319,[Police Commissioner Evans: Local Police Can’t Prevent ICE Immigration Raids In Boston],"[Following President Donald Trump’s recent executive order on immigration, a surge of sweeps by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents has sparked anxiety for immigration advocates and families nationwide., Massachusetts leaders have vehemently resisted Trump’s orders, from Attorney General Maura Healey’s promise to meet Trump’s plan with “fierce opposition” to Mayor Marty Walsh’s vow to to protect undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation. Police Commissioner Bill Evans reported zero cases turned over to ICE in 2016., So what happens when ICE comes to Boston?, According to Evans, ICE has the right to perform deportation raids in Boston, without any local approval whatsoever., “If they have civil process and they have the right to do it under federal guidelines, they can, but we won’t participate in anything like that,” Evans said during an interview with Boston Public Radio Tuesday. “They don’t even have to notify us.”, Trump’s executive order contains a policy calling to expand a federal effort to use local law enforcement as de facto immigration agents, a program that was scaled back in the Obama administration., “I’ve always said we’re not the immigration police,” Evans said. “If someone is a violent felon, obviously they will get turned over, but other than that, we won’t participate in any immigration raids.”, Ultimately, Evans says, the most important decision in these cases is whether or not to grant bail, which is decided by neither immigration officers nor local police., “We have nothing to do with raids right now anywhere in the city of Boston,” Evans said. “Our procedure hasn’t changed, if we lock someone up, we fingerprint them, and the fingerprints get sent to the state police, FBI, Homeland Security and ICE. If they want to put a detainer on it, that’s their decision, but everyone has access to bail. The ultimate decider of whether or not anyone goes loose in the bail commissioner. We don’t make that call at all.”, Despite resistance from local police to act as immigration officers, it is technically within the legal right of ICE agents to pretend to be local police during raids in an effort to gain entry to private residences and perform arrests. With ICE agents using ‘deportation ruses’ and other tactics to find and arrest illegal immigrants, Evans says local immigrant communities are becoming less trustworthy of local police., “I’m fearful because we have large immigration communities like East Boston, where we’re having major issues around young kids getting killed [due] to violence,” Evans said. “It’s hard enough now to get them to talk and to build trust and respect, and I think what’s going on now is hurting our efforts and the whole idea of community policing, especially in immigrant communities.”, Evans spoke at a church in East Boston in early February, alongside Mayor Walsh and Cardinal Séan O’Malley, and urged the immigrant community to maintain their trust in the local police., “I made it clear that we’re not the immigration police, we’re here for you,” Evans said. “Don’t be afraid of us, because that’s not who we are, and that’s not who the mayor wants his police department to be.”, To hear Commissioner Evans’ full interview with Boston Public Radio, click on the audio link above. , Tori Bedford (she/her/hers) is a reporter at WGBH News and produces the All Rev’d Up podcast.

Charles Sennott, executive editor of The GroundTruth Project, says Owens raised legitimate concerns about the raid's approval and whether or not military officials and President Trump fully weighed the risks involved. , The New York Times reported that the mission was jeopardized when commandos lost the element of surprise after an intercepted communication. The team was also met with more militant firepower than expected., ""The questions are there and they need to be investigated,"" Sennott said., Sennott says the default posture of the Trump Administration so far has been to lash out when questioned.

1326,[Boston Council Prez Wu Wants Hearings By Citizen Petition],"[Boston City Council President Michelle Wu filed an ordinance with the City Clerk today that would, if passed by the Council, establish a mechanism by which ordinary residents would be able to petition the Council to hold a hearing on any matter., Dubbed the ""Right of Free Petition Ordinance,"" the bill filed today would require a formal City Council hearing of a matter brought by petition carrying the signatures of at least 250 city residents. , The ordinance is meant to mimic Massachusetts' statewide ""right of free petition,"" which allows citizens to place state ordinances on the ballot by means of petition. , Wu said that the threshold of 250 petitioners was based loosely on the number of signatures required to run for City Council in Boston — and that the number represents a starting point for discussion as the ordinance is taken up by the entire Council. , ""I want this to be an open frank discussion between all of my colleagues about what the role of the City Council is,"" Wu told WGBH News. , Wu said she had not shopped the ordinance around to other councilors before filing it and that she will formally introduce the ordinance to colleagues at the Council's weekly session on Wednesday. , Wu said she hopes hearings on her ordinance will balance the practical needs of the Council in its role of drafting and passing legislation — ""But also make sure we are the most responsive body we can be and we're there for residents who want to get involved, especially in this time of activity and protest and marches and people wanting to have a role and a voice. "", More than a dozen other municipalities around Massachusetts have similar ordinances, including Newton, Lawrence, and Chelsea. Those cities require fewer signatures, but are of course much smaller., The current proposal of 250 signatures would likely make the threshold for hearing-by-petition in Boston among the lowest by population in the Commonwealth., Lawrence Dicara, a former City Council President, said the council had explored similar issues in the late 70s, but that they never materialized as formal ordinance or home rule petition to the state legislature.   Dicara wondered whether the council might face a barrage of proposals by neighborhood activists — “neighborhood speed limits, for example” — that could pose a challenge to the status quo and flow of business.   But he was supportive of the measure, telling WGBH News  it “certainly worthy of ample discussion,” and that it would be a “good discussion” for Council to take up.,  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

1345,"[The UMass Culture of Bureaucracy Compromises Student, Faculty Vitality]","[
	 
	Higher education is ground zero for America’s ongoing culture war. But the battle to control the political tilt of the curriculum obscures another equally vital struggle: the contest between administrators and the faculty over who will define what higher education is today and how it will develop tomorrow.
	 
	The bad news is that here in Massachusetts – as indeed throughout the nation – bureaucrats are winning. This has two clear cut implications: student costs will continue to climb while the on campus intellectual climate declines.
	 
	To see this dynamic in action, look no further than the UMass system.
	 
	Consider Laura Krantz’ recent report in the Boston Globe that because of unanticipated budget shortfalls, the UMass Boston administration recently announced a cut in subscriptions and volumes deemed essential for teaching and scholarship by the faculty.
	 
	The cuts, the Globe reported, were made without consultation with faculty members. Equally destructive will be the reported $22.3 million budget shortfall for this year, “driven,” Krantz reported, “by rising payroll and construction costs.”
	 
	Rising payroll? It is highly unlikely that this item includes paying for additional professors or granting munificent pay raises to current faculty.
	 
	This past June WGBH/News reported that “scores” of adjunct (part-time, non-tenure track) faculty members – fully one-third of the faculty at UMass Boston – received warnings that they might not be rehired due to lack of funding. Larger classes were predicted, one emeritus professor warned.
	 
	And it is unlikely that money is being siphoned off to maintain the physical plant: The same WGBH/News report notes that the campus parking garages have been crumbling for decades, with netting installed to prevent falling chunks of concrete from injuring people. That a campus essentially 40 years old is in need to such major reconstruction is a political scandal of serious proportions. (For this the current administration can not be blamed.)
	 
	So where is the money going? The entire UMass system has lately expanded its handsomely-paid bureaucracy. Martin Meehan, former Congressman and now president of the UMass system, has been publicly pleading for the Legislature to allocate more funds. Yet Meehan himself exemplifies a big part of the problem – a growing and increasingly expensive administration. According to theGlobe, Meehan earns annual compensation of at least $769,500, including salary, annual performance bonuses, and car and housing allowances. It is easy, and doubtless part of the explanation for administrative bloat, that in a public university, administrators proliferate because of the ever-present thirst on the part of legislators, who approve institutional budgets, to pad payrolls with politically-connected individuals.
	 
	Of course, one might say, administrators are essential for the operation of any university. But when the size and duties of campus bureaucracies are examined, qualms arise. Consider, for example, UMass Amherst’s recent hiring of Eric Moschella as the school’s “first associate provost for student success.” Vice-Chancellor for Student Affairs and Campus Life Enku Gelaye and Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education Carol Barr made the breathless announcement:  “He will play an instrumental role in overseeing the strategy and framework to student success, working closely with campus partners on critical initiatives.” None of these “initiatives” were further described in the announcement.
	 
	It is no wonder, then, that in late December the UMass/Lowell adjunct faculty, who are part-timers paid by the course, protested in front of the UMass Club in Boston, demanding better salary and benefits. But all of this ignores the reason so many adjuncts are hired in the first place – they are much cheaper than the corps of permanent tenured faculty around which most universities historically have been built.
	 
	Indeed, adjuncts nationally have been replacing tenured faculty at a frantic pace: According to the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), adjuncts and other contingent faculty made up around 70 percent of the faculty at colleges and universities in 2011. Tenured faculty has become the exception, not the rule.
	 
	In the same issue of the Globe that reported the funding cuts at the UMass/Boston library, the letters column sported a missive by local human rights activist, author, and Holocaust scholar Jack Nusan Porter, who taught courses at UMass/Lowell between 1977 and 2003, complaining that at the current minimum salary of $4,400 per adjunct course, he could not afford to teach there any longer. “Why,” he asks, “is there no money for adjuncts?”  In other words, while the numbers of permanent tenured faculty are reduced, the adjunct teachers who replace them are being paid increasingly poorly.
	 
	The answer to Porter’s “why?” question likely lies in a comprehensive count of the massive bureaucracy now found on the various UMass campuses and in the central administration run by Meehan. But to my knowledge, nobody has released such a count, nor is that likely to happen.
	 
	As college bureaucracies grow, the failure, or refusal, of campus administrators to consult tenured faculty on major decisions has dire consequences for educational quality. Consider a column recently written by Daphne Patai, a long-time professor in the Department of Language, Literatures, and Cultures at UMass/Amherst. (Disclosure: Professor Patai and I serve together on the Board of The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a campus civil liberties organization.)
	 
	Professor Patai complained that the administration announced to the faculty, without prior consultation and bypassing the Faculty Senate, major changes to the curriculum that would have required students to take a third “diversity” course, thereby further limiting the number of traditionally academic courses in which they might enroll. After faculty outcry, the administration backtracked. Nevertheless, that the administration would announce such a change to the curriculum without first consulting the faculty is alarming.
	 
	Fewer books, fewer tenured professors, more bureaucrats: It does not augur well for the future of higher education as we know it.

1350,[Criminal Justice Overhaul Would Grant Prisoners Incentives For Shorter Sentences],"[Prisoners would have greater opportunities for early release, even if they received a mandatory minimum sentence, under legislation resulting from the cooperation between all three branches of government on criminal justice reform., ""One of the things the bill does is allow people who have been incarcerated for mandatory minimums to earn good time,"" Sen. William Brownsberg, the co-chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters Tuesday. He said the new opportunity to reduce imprisonment through program participation would not be available for mandatory minimums related to opiates or crimes committed in conjunction with violence, illegal gun possession or involvement of a minor., The broad outlines of the criminal justice reform bill that Gov. Charlie Baker plans to file were announced at an early morning press conference on Tuesday attended by House Speaker Robert DeLeo, Senate President Stan Rosenberg, Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Ralph Gants and other prominent government officials., Rahsaan Hall, director of the Racial Justice Program for the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, agreed with the speaker and Senate president that the legislation is a positive step, but said granting prisoners a means to earn good time is not a substitute for giving judges discretion to issue lesser sentences., ""I think that's a small step in the right direction. But I think there are a lot of people who end up in the criminal justice system serving lengthier sentences because of guilty pleas that are leveraged by the use of a mandatory minimum,"" Hall said. He said, ""Taking time off and having access to programming is important, and getting good time for that is important. But I think that we have to recognize how everybody's not going to get into those programs or going to avail themselves of those programs. Just because they don't do that though does not mean that they still deserve to serve a lengthy mandatory sentence."", The governor said more than half of people who are released from houses of correction and state prisons ""wind up back in the court system at some point after their release,"" and he said reducing that recidivism rate was the focus of the effort., ""Prison is, as it should be, a punishment, but the people of Massachusetts are better served when more individuals exit the system as law-abiding and productive members of society,"" Baker said. The governor suggested he sees value in current statutes that require a minimum period of incarceration for those convicted of certain crimes. He said the bill would ""set certain parameters for earning good time for certain drug distribution crimes while still honoring the mandatory minimum sentences established by the Legislature."", The chief justice of the state's highest court, on the other hand, sees fundamental problems with mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes. In his 2014 State of the Judiciary address, Gants said those strict sentencing parameters have a ""disparate impact upon racial and ethnic minorities,"" and eliminating those sentencing floors would ""free up a considerable amount of money"" from the cost of imprisonment for use on programming and increases in the salaries of prosecutors and public defenders., ""Why would we require judges to impose sentences that are not informed by the social science evidence regarding what sentences reduce the risk of recidivism and what sentences may increase that risk?"" Gants asked in his 2014 address, according to a copy of the speech. ""But sadly, in drug cases where the law provides a mandatory minimum sentence, that is precisely the sentencing system we now have."", While not explicitly calling for the repeal of all mandatory minimum sentences, Gants on Tuesday spoke to ""the importance of individualized sentencing."", Criminal justice reform advocates have been hungering for a major bill since former Gov. Deval Patrick signed a sentencing reform law in 2012, and those seeking a further rollback of mandatory minimum sentences will likely track the bill through the committees and floor debates, where it may be amended., DeLeo and Rosenberg both indicated they saw the bill as a starting point, and Rosenberg has been outspoken calling for the elimination of mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders., ""Incarceration should be a last resort when there are other options available to people who have engaged in non-violent activities that may come into conflict with law, but are being driven either by their addiction or their mental illness. So I'm mindful of the fact that we call it the Department of Corrections not the Department of Punishment,"" Rosenberg said Tuesday., DeLeo, who has indicated a willingness to ""look at"" mandatory minimums for particular crimes, deferred to the committee hearing process when asked for his stance on the issue. In January, the speaker said, ""Knowing the body as I do know it, I would probably find that to be very difficult to just say dispense with all mandatory minimums."", The state enlisted the Council of State Governments to review the swath of laws and policies that govern Massachusetts's approach to criminal justice. Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito said there was an ""incredible"" effort by the CSG, including the review of more than 13 million state records and more than 300 in-person interviews., In addition to allowing people serving mandatory minimum sentences to reduce their time of incarceration by participation in programing - something Brownsberger said is generally not available now - the bill would also boost the rewards for all prisoners participating in programs., ""The good time availability goes up 50 percent for all prisoners,"" Brownsberger told reporters. On top of that, Brownsberger said the credit for completing a course would be increased from a maximum of 10 days now to a maximum of 90 days under the bill., Baker said giving drug offenders a tangible reason to participate in programming would help reduce the recidivism rate., ""The way the system currently works, there really isn't much of an incentive for them to participate in programming, and we think that would be a good thing,"" Baker said., As of fiscal 2014, it cost an average $53,040.87 annually to house a Department of Correction inmate., There were 9,066 people in Department of Correction custody and 10,768 in county facilities as of Feb. 13, according to DOC data. The CSG review found that the state's total incarcerated population fell 12 percent between 23,220 and 20,325, while recidivism rates have hovered around 40 percent., Brownsberger said the programming is geared toward ""cognitive behavior programming, oriented toward changing criminal thinking."" The Belmont Democrat said about two thirds of the ""drug mandatories would be opened up to earning good time,"" and said the bill aims to improve programming within correctional facilities and probation and parole supervision outside prison walls at a cost of about $3.5 million for the first year., The governor's office said the funding was included in the governor's budget bill., ""Three and a half million is certainly a start, but compared to the need, that doesn't go very far,"" said Lew Finfer, the director of the Massachusetts Communities Action Network., The governor said the bill would also ""allow judges to refer people to pre-trial services instead of holding them on bail."", [Katie Lannan contributed reporting]]"
1351,[Massachusetts Hotline Tracks Post-Election Hate],"[Editor's note: This story contains language that may be offensive to some readers., Harassment, threats and intimidation of minorities and immigrants spiked nationwide after President Trump's election in November. Comprehensive statistics are hard to come by, but officials and watch groups say hate-motivated incidents remain higher than usual more than three months after Election Day., Massachusetts is among the many states that have seen such a spike., ""There was one night, where my parents and I were walking out of a department store,"" recalls Nadia Butt, 36, of Danvers, Mass., a suburb north of Boston. ""And two white males yelled ... 'F****** immigrants go home!' "", Butt says she froze. So did her parents, American citizens who emigrated from Pakistan 40 years ago., ""My dad just kept hugging me as I was crying and just kept repeating that in all of his years of living here, he has never experienced such hatred,"" says Butts., The rise in incidents like this one spurred Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey to set up a new phone hotline to field hate and harassment complaints and track their frequency., ""I just thought it was so important that we be clear that here in Massachusetts we're going to enforce civil rights laws, we're going to prosecute hate crimes and we're going to be paying attention,"" says Healey., The calls flooded in right away. Officials say they've gotten some 250 substantive reports since the election, half of those in November alone. A racist and threatening video was circulated at a local school; an immigrant, in the country illegally, was physically assaulted by a co-worker; two Jewish community centers received bomb threats; and a mosque received a letter calling for ethnic cleansing., ""The kinds of incidents that we're seeing are really scary and troubling,"" Healey says., A rising star among state Democrats, Healey is a vocal Trump critic. She says the hotline has received calls from Trump supporters who say they're being harassed., But most frequently, Healey says, the targets are perceived immigrants and minorities, and the hateful messages often invoke Trump's name, or reference his words., ""Unfortunately what we saw over the last 18 months from Donald Trump were statements that were misogynist, racist, homophobic, xenophobic,"" says Healey. ""And that unfortunately seems to have been matched by this increase, this real uptick in hate crimes and bias incidents."", In a news conference this week, President Trump denied any part in inspiring ""racism and horrible things that are put up,"" saying the nation was already ""seriously divided"" before he was elected. He blamed ""people on the other side"" for the rise in these incidents, suggesting that his political opponents are trying to frame his supporters as the culprits. He focused less on denouncing the hate, as he did during an interview with 60 Minutes in November., ""I will say this and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it,"" he said about the dozens of acts of harassment and intimidation against minorities that were reported after his election, many of which were allegedly performed in his name, In the first month after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a hate watch group, cataloged 1,094 bias-related incidents nationwide, based on local news reports. Massachusetts was near the top of the group's list, with 53 incidents, trailing only California (125), New York (94) and Texas (71), and tied with Washington state., Mark Potok, a senior fellow at SPLC, says clearly this spike isn't restricted to states where Trump prevailed in November., ""This is not a phenomenon that is only occurring, say, in the Deep South, or in the very red states out West,"" Potok says. ""There are enormous numbers of Americans who feel very uncomfortable with the way the country is changing — more and more people who are foreign-born, more and more Muslims, more people who, in one way or another, do not look like what many people think of as a sort of normal red-blooded American."", In Massachusetts, the attorney general can respond to a hotline report with a criminal or civil case, though more commonly, her office will assist — or prod — local prosecutors and police to act., Frequently, no perpetrator is ever identified, and no charges result. But prosecution is not the hotline's only goal. Staffers also offer up some much-appreciated sympathy and share outrage with callers on the other end of the line., Eniola Soyemi, a Boston University graduate student from Nigeria, is one of many callers who say that just being heard and having her ordeal officially documented was therapeutic in itself. After the election, she experienced what she describes as a torrent of racist harassment., ""These kinds of incidents demoralize you as a human being,"" Soyemi says. ""And even though you know deep, deep down inside you that that person is morally wrong, you do need other people to verify that. And I think it does help you move on from such an incident."", Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.]"

1353,"[Author George Saunders On His New Novel, 'Lincoln In The Bardo']","[Renowned short story author George Saunders has released his first novel, “Lincoln in the Bardo.” The book explores Lincoln's grief after losing his son Willie and the difficulty and pain that can occur while transitioning through the dividing markers of our life. Saunders joined Boston Public Radio Friday to discuss the acclaimed novel. What follows are excerpts from that conversation., The meaning behind the bardo., “The bardo is a Tibetan word that means transitional state and usually it’s used to talk about that state that exists between the incident of your death and whatever happens next, let's say reincarnation. It is that realm that we don’t really know about, but might be important.”, What fascinated him about the story of Lincoln at Oak Hill Cemetery., “In 1862 Lincoln’s beloved son passed away and there were reports in the newspaper that Lincoln had been so grief-stricken that he actually went into the crypt on several occasions, and somehow interacted with the body. I heard this way back when our kids were little during the Clinton administration. I thought first of all, how does a president leave the White House alone, and second of all, the terrible pain of that. I put that in the bag of stuff I would like to write about someday. I put it aside for 20 years and it kept bugging me and in 2012 I gave it a try.”, Why he put off writing the book for 20 years., “My work is mostly sci-fi, dystopian, funny — there is just a little squeamishness that I had found a comfort zone in which I was having some success. I thought that this was going to require more straight writing that I felt I could do. In other words, I didn’t think I could find a prose style that would come alive in this story.”, On the unique prose style of the book., “Part of the fun for me is that if you are going to write about the afterlife it would be pretty weird if the afterlife turns out to be exactly what we think, 'Hi, Saint Peter.' … I thought part of the fun would be to make an afterlife that was a little freaky. That wasn’t what you expected. Also, that the reading experience itself would be a bit destabilizing. By a lot of trial and error, I came up with this way where there are something like 250 monologues in the book by 166 different speakers, but the attributions are given at the end. So I think often, people are telling me they're reading and they don’t quite know who is speaking and the first 15 pages are a bit of a challenge. They knock you off your feet and hopefully that pays off in the end.”, Distinguishing historical fact from historical fiction., “We have to be really strong in the distinction, because in a work of art you pay your money, you walk into the thing labeled novel, and you were playing a game together that involves lots of gamesmanship and fun. The whole point of that is to spit out some beautiful, transcendent moment for you, the reader. It is kind of like when you are telling your kids a ghost story and you say, 'and it happened in this very room.' They know that it didn’t, but the idea that it did makes the story better. When you are on the podium at the White House, and you say A and you know B is true, that is a totally different thing.”, The impact of losing his son and why Lincoln is such a beloved figure., ""The effect on him, we don’t really know, but what I came to think was, okay you’ve got this terrifying loss, what does it do? It tenderizes you somewhat. Then you take that new tender self and suddenly there you are in 1862, you know what does that do. Historically, Lincoln, we love him because his empathy pod expanded as things got tougher. He came to love more people. He came to love these Americans who were being enslaved. He came to love even the soldiers of the south.”, Jason Turesky is an Associate Producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

So, I basically was just taking my dad's pickup truck that he left me. I retrofitted it to record and mic'ed it up and gave these guys a chance to be heard., HS: What neighborhoods do you visit?, MB: So, I work with Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, Jamaica Plain, East Boston, Chelsea, all over different parts of Boston proper but also the Chelsea community and anywhere actually.

It's like them getting their first birthday cake ever., HS: Where did the collaboration with the Boston police come in? That's the #Black With Blue campaign., MB: We sat down, basically Chris, myself, and a few others, we were talking about we're using this to de-escalate situations in the city of Boston between young men and other young men... gang rivalries for the most part. So, #BlackWithBlue was, you know, thought up with those of us that work at A&amp;G so that we could use the de-escalation point of Mobile Stu., HS: And that's where the song in the video “One Beat For Peace” came in. Yes. Which is awesome by the way., MB: Thank you., HS: It's great too. Any reaction from the Mayor or the Police Commissioner or any other city officials?, CL: Marty tweeted about it, Marty Walsh, Mayor Marty. , MB: Deputy Nora Baston tweeted about it several times. She's like one of our biggest supporters., CL: She was she was absolutely amazing to me. She marshaled a bunch of people. We kept saying that, you know, for it to be successful it couldn't just be about police presence there had to be participation, and the folks that showed up, we had this roundtable discussion and there was artwork and of course we recorded the track.

1356,[New Lowell High School Set To Be Most Expensive In Massachusetts ],"[
	Plans to renovate and expand Lowell's high school could make it the most expensive school building project in Massachusetts with a price tag of $344 million. 
	 
	Lowell High School is currently housed in a historic 1920s building downtown. It's in desperate need of repairs and expansion to keep up with the more than 3,500 students it serves. 
	 
	Lowell City Council is considering a few different options, one of the least expensive being to build a new campus on an open space at the edge of town. It would be next to Cawley Stadium, which is already used by students for football, soccer, and lacrosse events.
	 
	For some parents, that makes perfect sense: it's cheaper, includes room for expansion, and wouldn't require kids to study in portable buildings during construction. 
	 
	Eric Nelson is a lifelong resident of Lowell and a third-generation graduate of Lowell High School. He's also a member of the group Citizens for Cawley, which supports the new campus option. Nelson believes a multi-year renovation project with extensive modular classrooms isn't a conducive learning environment for his children.

	But a large group of parents think the no brainer is keeping the high school where it is so students can walk to school each morning. The disagreement seems to break down along demographic lines, between affluent families near the new site and those closer to the city.

	 , ""Seventy-five percent  of our students are at or below the poverty level. Many of those students live in the neighborhoods within walking distance of the downtown,"" Doherty said., , Whichever option Lowell City Council chooses, the price tag is set to break records with the state picking up two-thirds of the bill.  , ""Go to the seaport district or downtown Boston, you can see, there's a lot of activity.

	Boston City Councilors heard testimony on Tuesday about an initiative in the Boston Police Department that would enlist trained clinical specialists to accompany police officers when they're responding to someone with likely mental health issues. City Council members want to see that program expanded. 
	 
	Twenty-two-year Boston Police veteran Sammy Silta told City Councilors that not so long ago, when it came to responding to situations involving someone with a mental health issue, ""The way we used to make the problem go away was to make the person go away — so we would arrest that person."" 
	 
	That, Silta says, has changed — partly thanks to a program that pays for mental health clinicians to accompany police officers. But right now, the program employs only two clinicians for the whole city, and it's funded by a temporary grant. 
	 
	City Councilors Annissa Essaibi-Goerge and Ayanna Pressley, who co-sponsored the resolution calling for Tuesday's hearing, want to see at least one clinician in every police district — and for the program to be part of the city's budget.

She told the crowd “It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys – and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent and capable. Others went further - including singer Joy Villa - who wore a ""Make America Great Again"" dress with ""Trump"" written on the train. There was also Katy Perry – who performed in front of a “We the People” sign, and wore pa Planned Parenthood button, and an armband with the word “persist” on it – referencing Elizabeth Warren.

1380,[Early Impeachment Talk],"[After some stinging defeats and public embarrassments on the domestic front, President Trump has been taking a more global view. Today, he hosted Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the White House – to talk about immigration policy and trade – since our neighbor to the north is another partner in NAFTA. This weekend, Japan's prime minister Shinzo Abe was here to meet President Trump. The meeting came as North Korea successfully launched a ballistic missile. Dealing with the rogue behavior of a dictator might seem like the easy part of the job to Donald Trump.  He's trying to figure out the next step on his travel ban, a senior advisor got her hand slapped for pitching Ivanka Trump's merchandise on TV, and National Security Advisor Michael Flynn could be in trouble for talking to the Russians before Trump took office. All that is feeding a story line that the Trump administration  is in chaos. When it comes to the court of public opinion, here's the verdict: a poll found a 46-46 split among voters when asked if Trump should be impeached – just as he starts the 4th week of his presidency. That poll also found his disapproval rating is now up to 53 percent and that more voters would prefer to see Barak Obama or Hillary Clinton in the White House.

Administration officials who spoke under the condition of anonymity to the Washington Post say he cannot be trusted. And notably, amid the chaos, President Trump has yet to defend him., Flynn says he can’t be sure whether he talked about sanctions with the ambassador, despite testimony from nine current and former U.S. officials who say he did., Charlie Sennott talked about the gravity of Flynn’s talks with Russia on BPR today, calling possible discussion of sanctions “a big deal” because it “contravenes the president of the United States’ policies.”, “Some would say that’s the kinda deal that’s about undercutting power, that gets darn close to things that some people would even call treason, that people would call impeachable offenses,” said Sennott., Senior adviser Stephen Miller did not say whether Trump had confidence in Flynn after the Washington Post reported he talked to Kislyak about sanctions., For Sennott, Miller’s lack of substantive response represents chaos within the Trump administration., “This is a real crisis coming inside the administration,” he said. “You’re undercutting foreign policy.”, Sennott also said he believed the Trump administration is trying to distract the public from news about its ties to Russia by pushing other news, like alleged voter fraud., “That voter fraud story to me is pyrotechnics and smoke screen,” he said. “And I think the Trump administration is putting it out intentionally because they know there’s real fire around Russia.”, Sennott said the media needs to stay patient with the Russia connection, pursuing it despite distractions., “I can’t say this with all the facts because they’re yet to come out, but my news radar is telling me Russia is the story, and we’ve got to stay on it as journalists,” he said. “I think this is the one to pay attention to, and this is the one we want to keep pounding on.”, Charlie Sennott is a news analyst here at WGBH, where he also heads up the GroundTruth Project.

I want to thank President Agent Orange for your unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban,” said rapper Busta Rhymes, who joined the group for the set., Reverends Irene Monroe and Emmett Price joined Boston Public Radio to discuss how the performance fit into a history of socially-conscious hip-hop music. Monroe is a syndicated religion columnist, and Price is a professor and Founding Executive Director of the Institute for the Study of the Black Christian Experience at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary., ""That's the essence of hip-hop,"" Price said. ""Hip-hop has always been social and political commentary from the voices of the oppressed and the ostracized."", Price specifically praised a point in the performance where a diverse group of individuals, including some wearing headscarves, formed a line across the stage. Not only was the performance a powerful protest against Trump's immigration restrictions on predominantly Muslim countries, but highlighted the large and overlooked portion of the American Muslim population who are also African American, Price said., ""They had individuals of Muslim descent there, and many of the rappers who were rapping were of Nation of Islam or Five-Percent Nation or Nation of God and Earth are Muslims.""

The 9th Circuit soundly rejected that claim, saying it runs contrary to democratic principles., ""They're not un-reviewable by the court,"" Rose said. ""This ruling out of the 9th Circuit methodically dismantled the argument that the government is un-reviewable, and then it went on to recognize a number of constitutional questions that were raised by the ban."", The move by the judges means citizens from the previously banned seven Muslim majority nations will be able to travel freely to the United States., ""The most important thing is, it's not just about law,"" Rose said. ""It's about all the lives, all the people, the children who were separated from their families, and the people who couldn't get home to get married or pursue their careers as scientists and doctors and things like that.

Boston parking ban goes into effect at 10 a.m. Boston and other communities have canceled Friday school.) , 2. The storm is traveling north. So Rhode Island and communities to the south will be hit earlier., 3. Cape Cod, the islands and southeastern Mass. are warned to brace for tidal flooding. A blizzard warning is also in effect. (That warning was extended to all of Mass.), 4. A band from the Berkshires to the Cape is expected to see the heaviest snow, perhaps as much as 15 to 16 inches in some areas. (Gov. Charlie Baker at his noon briefing said that new totals may hit 20 inches.), 5.Temperatures are expected to drop throughout the day, hitting a low in some areas of 5 degrees above zero Thursday night., 6. Thunder may result as the storm’s cold collides with the relatively warm weather the region has enjoyed for the last 24 hours., 7. Meteorologists say this storm has the potential to be the worst since 2015. We won’t know, of course, until it is over., 8. The heaviest snow is expected to trail off around 5 p.m. (Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is worried by reports that the storm may last longer, taxing plough crews that have been working since early Thursday morning. Baker said he expects state roads to be operational Friday.), 9. Why close schools and go on an emergency footing before the storm even hits? Because since the Blizzard of 1978 when chaos and loss of life ensued during the commute home, officials have acted proactively., 10. So far this season, we’ve had a bit less than 17 inches of snow.

Sessions has faced tough scrutiny about his tenure as the U.S. attorney for Alabama back in the 1980’s and early 90’s. Critics accused him of racist behavior and he was denied a federal judgeship by the U.S. Senate as a result. Senate Republicans dismissed Warren’s behavior as disrespectful – and maintained their support for Sessions. Jim Braude (@jimbraude) talks to former U.S. attorney for Massachusetts and Trump supporter Frank McNamara (@FrankLMcNamara4), who served when Sessions had the same post in Alabama and Harvard Law Professor Ron Sullivan, who was an advisor to the Obama transition team. He gets their perspectives on the Senator’s nomination and the Democrats opposition., Coverage from the GBH Newsroom.]"
1403,[Republicans Struggle To Replace The Affordable Care Act],"[From a leaked secret recording of the Republican retreat in January to Senator Bob Corker’s remarks yesterday, more and more evidence is surfacing to suggest Republicans don’t have a concrete plan for replacing the Affordable Care Act., The tape from the retreat shows Republican representatives grappling with big questions surrounding cost, coverage, Planned Parenthood, and the health insurance market, while Senator Corker said “There’s not any real discussion taking place right now.”, According to Medical Ethicist Art Caplan, these public snafus indicate a larger problem beneath the surface., “The Republican party [and] Trump have come up against a rock and a particularly hard place, which is they don’t have anything,” he said. “They have no idea how they’re going to repair or replace this program.”, The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has faced opposition since its first day of implementation; three representatives filed three separate bills calling for its repeal the day after it was signed in 2010., Opposition by Republicans has continued for the last seven years, despite the fact that the ACA has reduced the number of people without health insurance and has lowered overall healthcare spending., Caplan said Republicans struggle to create an alternative because the ACA was a moderate plan with good coverage, similar to the one adopted by Massachusetts., “To go in any other direction would take them either toward Democratic ideas about single payer which... I think are politically impossible right now, or back to more market approaches, which have no chance of continuing the same level of coverage for the same number of people,” he said. “There are too many sick, at risk, and pre-existing condition folks.”, Caplan conceded the ACA had financing troubles, while defending the act as the most viable healthcare option., “If you have very sick people, a lot in Medicaid, a lot with preexisting conditions, the only way to move ahead in terms of continuing their coverage and not chopping out benefits, is to basically keep something like [the ACA] that’s funded properly,” he said. “There’s no other option, and the Republicans will see that soon enough.”, Art Caplan is the Drs.

1404,[When Humans Intersect With Oceans: Artists Explore],"[A new exhibit at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and at Tufts University is taking a close look at how humans interact with the ocean, as well as at the environmental impact those interactions can have. , As curator Alaina Claire Feldman worked her way through the SMFA gallery showing “The Ocean After Nature,” she pointed out to a photo of a submarine breaking through arctic ice. There’s a science fiction film about global warming. One wall is dominated by two enormous photographs by the Korean artist Hyung S. Kim of figures wearing rudimentary diving equipment., “These images are from Jeju Island, which is in the very south,"" she said., The photos are of women called Haenyeo. In the 18th century, men on this Korean island were taxed on oysters and clams they gathered, so the women started supporting their families by diving for food – a tradition that’s still going on., “I love having them blown up here, because they look like real warriors, like ocean mermaid warriors,” Feldman said., , Across the room are photos and video of soup – but not just any soup. They’re illustrations from an exhibit called “Does This Soup Taste Ambivalent” by artists and brothers Tomoo and Ei Arakawa. They’re from Fukishima, Japan, where a tsunami caused a nuclear disaster in 2011. The artists invited their mother to cook a soup and serve it to guests of an art gallery., “The tricky thing about this is the soup was made with radishes and mushrooms that came from that region,"" Feldman said. ""And you see in these images there’s the performance of the soup being served. There’s also documentation of the goods being tested to see if they’re radioactive."", The question of whether the soup is radioactive is what the piece is all about., ""The government has said no, they’re not,"" said Feldman. ""And so the ambivalence in ‘Does This Soup Taste Ambivalent?’ is what are your emotions about consuming this, would you eat the soup?”, Feldman said she’s hoping to get the artists to come to Boston with some soup before the exhibit closes, but she said with a laugh she probably wouldn't eat the soup herself., Feldman said the works in the exhibit don’t actually propose anything particular about how we should act, but she said they make us think more carefully about what we do. That’s also true of the work of local artist Evelyn Rydz. She’s also part of the “Ocean After Nature” exhibit, but her work got its own show called ""Floating Artifacts” at the Tufts University Art Gallery., , The gallery is full of her portraits of colorful and oddly shaped objects against a black background. They’re all things Rydz found on beaches around the world., “What you’re looking at in the room, these are all plastic,"" Rydz said. ""Although they feel completely different. Different colors, textures, surfaces, some of them have become micro-habitats.”, Ordinarily, plastic in the ocean is considered trash, but there's something beautiful about these images. However, that's not the point for Rydz., “So, I’m less interested in making them beautiful. I’m not interested in the objects themselves so much as I am their history and what’s happened to them,"" she said. ""I’m more interested in the ocean and the way the ocean has sculpted them, changed them.”, In the middle of the room is a microscope and a typewriter. Rydz is inviting guests to take a close up look at the actual specks of plastic, and then to fill out a card like you’d see in a natural history museum., ,  , “Just like an archaeologist in the past would collect ancient pottery shards to tell us something about past civilizations, I think future archaeologists might unfortunately be looking at pieces of plastic along the coast as an index back to who we are today,"" Rydz said., Rydz said she hopes this is something that we'll think about when we throw things away, and as people look at her exhibit, she wants them to think, maybe it is a piece of something that was once theirs. These are tiny things, she said, but they have a huge lasting impact through geologic time. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"
1405,[The Number Of Hungry And Homeless Students Rises Along With College Costs],"[There's no way to avoid it. As the cost of college grows, research shows that so does the number of hungry and homeless students at colleges and universities across the country., Still, many say the problem is invisible to the public., ""It's invisible even to me and I'm looking,"" says Wick Sloan. He came to Bunker Hill Community College in Boston more than a decade ago to teach English full time. He says it felt like he quickly became a part-time social worker, too., ""When I first got here, I was always told that we should never miss a chance to give students food,"" he says. ""I foolishly thought at the time they meant Doritos and cookies. It's protein that they're after. It's crazy."", Bunker Hill is home to one of 25 food assistance programs on Massachusetts' public college campuses. That leaves just four public campuses across the state without one., One first-year student at Bunker Hill, whose name we aren't using to protect her safety and privacy, was living in a shelter in Boston last summer when she first decided she wanted to enroll in classes here., But she says that shelter didn't feel safe. ""If I wanted to get good grades, if I wanted to get a good education, I needed to be at a slightly safer shelter,"" she says., She was put on a long waiting list for a bed at a youth home and finally got in after six months. That's when she enrolled at Bunker Hill., Now she's majoring in math., ""I knew that I really loved learning, but I wasn't sure if I was going to fit into the education system."", She says she has been pleasantly surprised by Bunker Hill, though. ""This is a really good place to figure out where you might go with your education,"" she says., Across the country, college administrators are increasingly seeing students like her., Researchers at the University of Wisconsin surveyed more than 4,000 undergrads at community colleges across the country., The results? Twenty percent of students reported being hungry, 13 percent homeless., Sara Goldrick-Rab, a sociologist who led the research team, says it's not just that college students need to work while in school. ""It's that they're working, and borrowing,"" she says, ""and sometimes still falling so short that they're going without having their basic needs met."", Goldrick-Rab says she believes state and federal governments should work together to help college students find a place to live and something to eat so that they're ready to learn and, eventually, graduate., ""Most people think, 'Well, if you're really poor, and you really don't have money to eat, you can get food stamps,"" she says. ""What they don't know is that for a college student, who doesn't have children, to get food stamps requires that they work 20 hours a week."", And that's exactly what the first-year student from Bunker Hill has managed to do. She's putting in 20 hours a week at a physics lab close by and has recently saved enough to rent an apartment with two roommates. She says she still needs help affording tuition and transportation., Copyright 2017 WGBH Radio.

But some members of the group stayed, first attempting to erect tents  on City Hall Plaza and then, when they say police wouldn’t allow the tents, staying overnight without tents., Thia Simon, who is 19, said that she and about 20 others spent the night huddled in sleeping bags after police told them they would not be allowed to erect tents., Simon, whose parents immigrated to Boston from Haiti, said that she became involved in the group because of her family’s experiences with gentrification., “It’s just been very hard to stay in one spot,” Simon said. “So much of my life I’ve been moving around. It’s so hard to lay down roots.”, The group has mobilized around attempting to persuade the BPDA not to approve the neighborhood plan without adding more stringent affordable housing requirements to it., The plan, officially titled “Plan: JP/ROX,” lays out a vision for future development, zoning, and city planning, including plans for new housing., As currently written, the plan describes as much as 40 percent of new housing as being “affordable” — although critics contest that many of those units still won’t be “affordable” at area income levels., Members of the assembly yesterday called for more than fifty percent of new housing to be affordable, and for the city to re-evaluate its definitions of affordability., Danielle Sommer, a lifelong resident of Roxbury and Jamaica Plain, and one of the organizers of the group pushing to change the development plan, told WGBH News today that the group does not oppose development generally., “We know folks are going to come to our neighborhood — partially because residents invested a lot of time and energy into making it a great place to live,” said Sommer., “We want to welcome new people — we just don’t want it to be at the expense of our own homes.”,  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

1418,[DUI App],"[We all know that drinking and driving is not only a bad idea—it’s illegal. And yet, according to the Centers for Disease Control, nearly a third of all traffic-related deaths in the U.S. involve alcohol. So, if we can’t exercise better judgment, maybe technology can help. A professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute and his students are developing an app with the hope that it will prevent us from getting behind the wheel after a few drinks., The app is called AlcoGait. Not the catchiest of names, but it’s a prototype with big ambitions. As computer science professor Emmanuel Agu explains it, the idea is to provide a reality check for those who underestimate how drunk they are., “What happens is when you drink alcohol, the first part of your brain to be affected is the part that tells you if you're too drunk to drive,” says Agu., Using the gyroscope and accelerometer that are already built into every smartphone, AlcoGait’s algorithm captures your movements when you’re sober—specifically, your gait. It only needs about a minute to memorize your so-called sober walk. Once it does that, it’s able to detect changes in your strut as you drink. The idea is to turn on the app right when you start drinking. It works passively, so you don’t need to enter anything as the night goes on., “If you sway much more than your sober baseline, then it concludes that you're drunk,” Agu says., Christina Aiello wrote a lot of the code behind AlcoGait, and she walks me through how it works. After launching the app, she enters my profile info-- gender, age, height and weight. This also allows it to track my blood alcohol content., “Now we need to get a baseline, so we need to know how you walk when you're sober, so we're going to do that first,” Aiello says. “I'm going to click 'start,' lock the screen, and you have to put it in your pocket, then you're going to hear a dinging noise, and that's when you know you start walking.”, Aiello slips the phone into my pocket. I go for a walk up and down the halls of Worcester Polytech’s Fuller Labs. It takes a few tries for the app to register my walk because I’m wearing a skirt. For now, AlcoGait works best in pants pockets but that’s something the team is working to improve., The app now knows how I walk when I’m completely sober. The true test is what happens after I put on the Drunk Buster Goggles, which blur my vision and completely disorient me. This particular pair simulates impairment associated with a blood alcohol content of .15-.25. For me, that’s about 3-4 drinks in an hour., “At that point, you're way past the legal limit and nearing the point where you're probably going to want to go to the hospital, honestly.” Aiello says.                                        , I stumble down the hallway again, occasionally bumping into the wall. When the AlcoGait app detects the swaying movements, an alert goes off. The alarm is persistent—and that’s the point. Aiello says the user can set it up so that the alert will notify a friend. In this case, the Aiello is alerted., “What the app has told me is that my friend, who's using the AlcoGait app, has reached an estimated BAC range of 0.25 or higher.” Aiello says, looking at her smartphone.         , Aiello says that friend can then call an Uber or send a taxi over., But the question remains—would people actually use AlcoGait? After all, don’t many of us like to think we exercise good judgment?, Nancy Barnett, a professor of behavioral and social sciences at Brown University, studies the intersection of alcohol use and internet-based technologies. She says she’s always hesitant when an app comes out making a claim like this., “There are many, many more apps out there that say they are supposed to help you do things,” says Barnett. “Everything from lose weight to stop smoking-- that haven’t been well validated or tested. So I’m always hesitant.”, That said, there is growing interest in one’s own bio-data. Just look at the rise of the Fitbit, the smartwatch and the growing number of apps that capture our daily movements. People are interested in what their bodies are trying to tell them and Barnett says that would be the driving factor., “I do think that you know, someone who is interested in using this is interested either in the fun of it like ‘oh I wonder if it will tell me I’m too drunk or when I’m too drunk’ and being curious about that but also people who are serious and saying I want some feedback.”, The breathalyzer will always be the gold standard but so far, AlcoGait’s accuracy rate is 90% based on the 50 people they’ve monitored-- but it will take a large-scale study with lots of booze to put the app to the ultimate test. Agu is optimistic it will happen if funding comes through this spring., In the meantime, just be careful., Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

1421,[Homeless Families Turn To Emergency Rooms For Shelter],"[An emergency room is, by definition, a destination of last resort., Dr. Lois Lee, an emergency medicine physician at Boston Children’s Hospital, has worked at the hospital's Emergency Department since 1999., Mostly, she oversees the treatment of critically ill children., But not all the emergencies Dr. Lee sees are medical. Last December, a woman showed up at the emergency room, pregnant and with her two-year-old twins., The twins weren’t sick. The family was there because they had nowhere else to go. They had found themselves homeless., Emergency rooms are not meant, of course, to serve as emergency housing., But hospital officials and some advocates for homeless families say that the number of homeless families turning to emergency rooms — and not the state — for shelter is on the rise. And data reviewed by WGBH News suggests an increase in the proportion of families turning to state shelter in Massachusetts —the only “Right to Shelter” state in the country — after having already gone without adequate shelter., The woman and her twins at Boston Children’s Hospital were assigned a hospital social worker to help seek alternative shelter., But when shelter couldn’t be secured, the family was given one of the hospital’s small rooms to sleep in. They would end up staying a week., “If there truly is no safe place for them we cannot in good conscience send these families back out,” says Lee. , It’s hardly an ideal solution for anyone. Families, Lee notes, risk exposure to contagious disease. Children could witness traumatic events in E.R. And the potential for trauma doesn’t end there.,  “These are just really families trying to do the best they can for themselves and have just come to a place where they — they can’t,” Lee said. “And that’s very hard.”, Lee says she regularly sees probably between ten and fifteen families a month, and similar reports have surfaced at other area hospitals., During busy hours, families might have to wait in the waiting room. When things calm down, staff will try to find them a room., And the number of these families appears to be growing., Since Lee and her colleagues began collecting data on these visits, about eight years ago, the number of families reporting to the Children’s Hospital E.R. because they were homeless has grown from just seven families showing up without a place to sleep in 2012 — to some one hundred forty families in 2015., In just the first two months of 2016, the last for which they collected data, they saw over forty families — about the same number who showed up all year in 2013., What the numbers don’t explain is: why?, Some advocates for homeless families blame changes made years ago to the state’s “Emergency Assistance” program for homeless families — as well as a recent push by Governor Charlie Baker to eliminate the use of hotels and motels as emergency housing., State officials, meanwhile, deny those claims and emphasize that families facing homelessness are placed in the state’s Emergency Assistance program “presumptively,” — with an assumption, in other words, of eligibility for assistance., Massachusetts is the only state in the country that guarantees that homeless families be provided shelter, at the state’s expense, immediately., But a 2012 change to the law spelled out certain eligibility criteria, including fleeing domestic abuse, fire or natural disaster, eviction, substance abuse or safety threats — or having spent the previous night in a place “not meant for human habitation.”, It’s that last threshold that has caused the most controversy., Prior to the change, said Kelly Turley, director of legislative advocacy for the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, families who found themselves suddenly upended from housing — kicked out of a friend’s house, for example — “would apply for shelter and they would be placed that night.”, “But now they have to wait to show that they’ve gone to the extreme of staying in an unfit place,” Turley said — like an emergency room., Paul McMorrow, a spokesman for the state Department of Housing and Community Development, says that families are placed in the state’s Emergency Assistance program “presumptively,” — with an assumption that they are eligible — and that no family should ever feel forced to approach an emergency room for shelter., McMorrow said the Department has met with hospital officials to work on the issue., Some critics of the state’s apparatus, meanwhile, point to another change in the landscape of shelter for families: the rapid decline of the state’s use of hotels and motels as temporary housing., Under a directive by Governor Charlie Baker the state has gone from housing over fifteen hundred families in hotel rooms just over one year ago to fewer than ninety now., The use of hotels has long been controversial, and there is widespread agreement that they are hardly ideal shelter for families., But as the use of hotels has dwindled, while some capacity has been replaced with shelter units — not all of it has (the state has increased the use of vouchers and other programs to “divert” families who might otherwise become homeless)., In December, the nonprofit law firm Greater Boston Legal Services sued the state’s Department of Housing and Community Development, which oversees the state’s Emergency Assistance program, alleging, in part, that in its push to end the use of hotels the state has been failing to meet its legal obligations to house families., According to a complaint filed this January, one of the named plaintiffs, a mother of two girls, aged 7 and 9 and who is pregnant, was denied emergency assistance after the family was told they had to leave a friend’s house where they’d been staying. After spending the night sleeping on the floor of an un-named nonprofit, the complaint alleges, the family re-applied for state assistance., “They still didn’t place her then, so the next night she went to the emergency room, having no other place to go, and stayed there,” says Ruth Bourquin a senior attorney at GBLS., State officials forcefully dispute the claim that eligible families are being turned away and say that the department is meeting its obligations under the law., State data reviewed by WGBH News does not indicate that the state’s placement rate for homeless families has changed substantially over the last year (though critics contend that the numbers don’t include families turned away before they apply)., But the proportion of families seeking shelter after having stayed in a place “not meant for human habitation” did increase, according to state records — from 11 percent in 2015 to 19 percent last year., Legislation recently submitted by State Representative Marjorie Decker, of Cambridge, would change the program’s requirement language, removing the criteria of having already spent the night in an unsafe place., “The idea that someone who is not really entitled to emergency shelter wants to spend one night voluntarily in a shelter, with their children —” said Decker, “To suggest that they have a better alternative, but they’re not choosing it, is absurd.”,  ,  , Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"
1422,[Who Governs Harvard? The Faculty Or The Bureaucrats?],"[A battle between Harvard’s growing administration and its Arts and Sciences faculty is in full-swing, with a (likely temporary) truce declared last week. The contest, which might seem to some to be a form of “inside baseball” of interest only to Harvard-watchers, actually has potentially vast implications for students’ rights, faculty governance powers, and the reigning in of the increasingly bureaucratic academy throughout the nation., Harvard administrators last year took up an old pattern of bureaucratic intrusion into students’ private lives. In May of 2016, University President Drew Faust and College Dean Rakesh Khurana unilaterally announced a policy that would bar undergraduate members of private single-gender social clubs from eligibility for campus leadership positions, team captaincies, and Rhodes and Marshall scholarships., Khurana and Faust’s goal, in the name of “diversity and inclusion,” is to force the clubs to either become co-ed or disband. (An earlier stated rationale du jour of decreasing sexual assault lies largely abandoned as statistically dubious since most assaults occur in dormitories.) The Khurana-Faust edict constituted an attack on undergraduates’ right to freely associate and would be wrong however imposed., But this incursion also usurped faculty governance powers contained in university statutes. The new policy, written by administrators behind closed doors, has effectively become a referendum not only on micro-management of students’ social lives, but also on who governs -- teachers or administrators., Faculty critics of the Faust-Khurana policy, led by computer science professor and former Dean of Harvard College Harry Lewis, argue that the administration should not infringe the associational rights of students. They also cite the administration’s indefensible selectivity in recognizing certain officially favored affinity groups, among them the Organization of Asian American Sisters in Service and the Black Men’s Forum., In response to the policy, Professor Lewis and 11 other professors proposed a simple motion to the Faculty: ""Resolved: Harvard College shall not discriminate against students on the basis of organizations they join, nor political parties with which they affiliate, nor social, political or other affinity groups they join, as long as those organizations, parties or groups have not been judged to be illegal."", It is a declaration of student independence, with an underlying message of faculty supremacy over bureaucratic micro-management of undergraduate life. (It is of some consequence that more than 53 percent of undergraduates are against the new policy, according to The Harvard Crimson.), A factor potentially aggravating the situation is the fact that Faust has not clearly said whether she would honor a faculty vote against her and Khurana’s initiative., Tension between Harvard’s faculty and administration is nothing new. In an infamous incursion into students’ private associational rights, undergraduate deans in the 1920s held a secret inquisition that resulted in the expulsion of eight students who, the deans concluded, were involved in homosexual activity., Contrary to standard Harvard practice, it was the deans, rather than the faculty governed Administrative Board, that heard the evidence in secret and then decided these students’ fate. Indeed, two of the convicted students had done nothing more than associate with their gay classmates., During the 1950’s Red Scare, Harvard punished members of its faculty for holding Communist sympathies. It took Harvard’s administration years to live down these violations of faculty independence and academic freedom., Yet four years ago, administrators secretly ordered – in violation of faculty rules – the search of emails of 16 resident tutors to find out if any had leaked embarrassing information about a cheating scandal., Faculty members erupted in anger. The administrators responsible for the intrusion were not fired. It seems that Harvard’s current administrators are unable to see their recent actions in the context of Harvard’s long and troubling history of punishing students and faculty for their associations according to the moral panics of the day., Further, they seem to lack a sense humility that might allow them to see that just as their predecessors were wrong to punish suspected homosexuals and communists, they too might be mistaken in targeting a group they deem to think in ways contrary to Harvard’s current values., Tenured faculty, by contrast, are less prone to enacting such hasty and aggressive policies in response to the latest moral panic., This hesitance to wade chin-deep into the personal lives of students is partially due their having other matters with which to concern themselves (namely, teaching and research), whereas the bureaucrats do not., But it also seems that the faculty take long views, adopting an institution-wide sensibility that grants them a wisdom seemingly absent from the administrators. Time and again, the Harvard faculty have understood the utmost importance of allowing basic freedoms to reign at the university. Administrators, alas, have too frequently failed this test. , Faust and Khurana were obviously sufficiently concerned about the incipient faculty rebellion that they have taken last-minute evasive action to derail the faculty’s oppositional motion. It's a bit of slight of hand, because the substance of the sanctions are preserved., In a January 25th letter to the faculty, Khurana announced a vast “faculty-led committee” composed as well of students and administrators to “make recommendations” for how the “policy can be improved.” While “faculty engagement is both welcome and necessary,” Khurana wrote, the end-result will be that the essence of the policy will remain intact “to achieve this goal” of “a non-discriminatory Harvard experience.”, Professor Lewis and his faculty allies withdrew their motion, assuring a relatively peaceful February faculty meeting. But he warned the administration that the Faculty group was prepared to restart the campaign for student and faculty rights if this latest administrative twist turns out to be a chimera., Harvard sets the standard in higher education – what happens there often spreads nationally. The gradual takeover of higher education by bureaucrats at the expense of faculty power is evident in myriad ways and is much to the detriment of our students’ educational experience., Although studies show that the ideal operating ratio is about three tenure-track faculty members for every one administrator, by 2008, administrators actually outnumbered faculty two to one., The Harvard faculty’s success in re-asserting its powers and student autonomy would reverberate throughout all of higher education — so too would its failure., Harvey Silverglate is legal counsel for one of the “final clubs.” He is the co-author of The Shadow University: The Betrayal of Liberty on America’s Campuses (The Free Press, 1998), and a board member of The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.]"

1424,[Somerville Holds Rally In Support Of Sanctuary City Designation],"[Hundreds of residents gathered at Somerville High School on Saturday to rally against President Donald Trump’s executive order to strip federal funding from so called “sanctuary cities.”, “Today we are here to celebrate and support our sanctuary city status,” said Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone at Saturday’s One Somerville rally. “But let me be clear, when we say we are one Somerville - it goes well beyond that. Somerville will stand with you regardless of your race, your creed, your color, your nationality, legal status, religion, disability, gender identity or sexual orientation. When we say, we are one Somerville - we mean all are welcome and equal here.”, , This year marks 30 years since Somerville was designated a so-called “sanctuary city."" Somerville is among a number of  Massachusetts cities and towns with the designation, including Boston, Chelsea, and Holyoke., In the weeks following last month’s executive order, Curtatone and other Somerville officials have said Somerville would remain a sanctuary city regardless of President Trump’s policies., On Saturday, hundreds of residents with signs gathered to show their support for Somerville’s sanctuary city status., Anne-Marie Fitzgerald, of East Somerville, went to the rally to show her support for her neighbors and friends in the community., “This is what we spend our weekends now … I think that there’s something about physicality that sends a message,” said Fitzgerald “I’ve lived here for 20 years and I never really thought about Somerville as a sanctuary. But I know what my neighborhood looks like and I’d like to keep it that way.”, , Alongside Mayor Curtatone, a handful of other speakers - many of them immigrants - told the crowd their stories of immigrating to the United States., Habib Ulah Akhlaqi is a student at Somerville High School. He and some of his classmates were among these speakers. Akhlaqi was born in Afghanistan, but grew up in Iran. He said growing up, he constantly asked himself who he was and where he belonged., “None of those countries accepted me because Afghanistan is a war and Iran government and some of those people didn’t accept me because they don’t like refugees,” said Akhlaqi. “Before I get to America, I hear a lot about America which is: it doesn’t matter your religion, it doesn’t matter your gender, your nationality - everyone is American.”, The rally was organized initially to support Somerville’s so called ""sanctuary city"" status, but many residents were also there to show support for all immigrants and refugees in light of last week’s temporary ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries., , Jeremiah Jordan was at the rally with his wife and twin sons. Jordan said his family came to the rally because keeping Somerville’s diversity is important to them., “It’s important that we respect all people - no human is illegal,” said Jordan. “Somerville is a city that does respect everyone and it’s important to have that diversity, to have that culture. I personally get frustrated every time someone says they’re not here illegally. I say, go back a couple generations in your family and see if someone didn’t come here illegally. It’s just a different time, a different era. Everybody needs their chance.”, Mayor Joe Curtatone echoed Jordan’s sentiments in his rally speech, but also urged attendees to start conversations with all citizens - regardless of their opinions or views.,  “We have to start bridging our political divides by talking to one another and finding where we share common ground,” said Curtatone. “I struggle with this daily. There are family members of mine, friends that are on the other side of this issue. So I’ve had to do something that is very hard which is not get angry with them and have some empathy and listen to them and ask them questions to find our shared values because I still, like you, believe we Americans share core common values of humanity, of civility, and equality for everyone.”]"

1440,[Travel Ban Repercussions],"[Those hoping to immigrate to the U.S. from one of the seven countries affected by President Trump’s immigration order now face uncertain futures.  For those seeking refugee status, it’s even more unclear. Many of those people have risked their lives helping U.S. troops overseas, providing intelligence, aid and translating for Americans on the ground. Thousands of Iraqis have resettled in the U.S. since 2008 under special visa programs created specifically to help those who put their lives in danger to help American soldiers. That process takes on average, 18 to 24 months, and more than 50 thousand are still waiting to be processed, according to the International Refugee Assistance Project.

To Bypass Immigration Enforcement],"[Hundreds gathered on Beacon Hill on Wednesday to try to stop Massachusetts tax funds from being used to enforce federal immigration law, a cause inflamed by President Donald Trump's recent crackdown on travel to the U.S. from seven Muslim countries., Protesters came out to Boston Common on Wednesday morning to support the Safe Communities Act, a bill that would restrict how local authorities interact with immigration enforcement., According to sponsor Sen. Jamie Eldridge's office, the bill would prohibit the federal government from accessing state databases in order to compile a registry based on national origin, religion, or other characteristics. The bill would ban local and state public safety officials from enforcing federal immigration rules and would stop county sheriffs from being deputized as immigration agents. It would also order that people detained by state or local authorities be informed of their right to an attorney and to decline an interview with federal immigration officials., A release from Eldridge's office publicizing the rally called Trump's orders ""xenophobic executive actions on immigration,"" and said the proposed legislation aims to ""protect the civil rights of all state residents by making sure our tax dollars are not used to help the Trump administration deport immigrant families or to create a Muslim registry."", The bill is sponsored in the House by Rep. Juana Matias, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who was elected to represent Lawrence this past November. Matias defeated Marcos Devers, the incumbent representative, in the Democratic primary race., “I want all immigrants to our state and all our Muslim friends and neighbors to know that you have many allies in the Massachusetts Legislature,” Eldridge wrote in the release. “We know that many of you risked your lives fleeing political oppression and economic despair to come here so that you can enjoy equality, liberty, and opportunity – and we will stand firmly against those who want to take that away from you.”   The Safe Communities Coalition, the group behind the rally, includes advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union, Centro Presente, the Democratic Socialists of America, the Essex County Community Organization, First Parish Brookline, Jewish Voices for Peace, the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition, Service Employees International Union 32BJ District 615, and more., Mike Deehan is WGBH News' State House reporter.]"
1443,[Dershowitz: 'This Is Not President Trump's Nomination To Make'],"[In a primetime televised event last night, President Donald Trump chose federal court judge Neil Gorsuch as his nominee to the Supreme Court. , If confirmed, Gorsuch would fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February of last year. President Obama chose Merrick Garland as his nominee to replace Scalia in March, but Senate Republicans — led by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — refused to grant Garland a hearing or subject his nomination to a vote., Famed Harvard Law professor and attorney Alan Dershowitz joined Boston Public Radio to weigh in on the decision. Dershowitz's latest book is ""Electile Dysfunction: A Guide for Unaroused Voters."", Read part of their conversation below., ALAN DERSHOWITZ: I can’t wait for the Democrats on the Senate committee to ask him the following question: 'Mr. Gorsuch, you’re a constitutionalist. Do you think the Republican senators acted properly by denying President Obama the right to have a vote on his nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland? What do you think of what the Republicans did? Do you approve of it?, JIM BRAUDE: And what does he say?, DERSHOWITZ: He’ll probably duck the question and say, 'Look, it’s a political question.' But what if it changes his performance as a judge? I don’t think he can justify what the Republicans did, and that’s the only basis on which his nomination may conceivably be stalled. You can’t oppose this guy on his credentials. He has superb credentials from Harvard Law School, Oxford University. You can’t really win a debate by opposing him on his ideology. He is an ideologically conservative candidate, but the president has a right to basically pick his candidate., The only basis you can really oppose him is this is not President Trump’s nomination to make. It was stolen from President Obama by unlawful and unprincipled failure to give the previous nominee even a hearing, or certainly an up-or-down vote. I think we’re going to hear some of that in the Senate confirmation. It will be interesting to hear how he responds., BRAUDE: If an uncommitted Democratic senator called you on the phone and said, 'I buy into that stolen seat mentality, even though I think he is qualified on the merits,' would you urge them to vote no and essentially do unto Gorsuch what was done unto Garland?, DERSHOWITZ: No. I think it would be better to take the high road and say, 'What the Republicans did was wrong, and we’re not going to play tit-for-tat politics. The Supreme Court is too important.', So in the end, I would say: 'Let’s ask hard questions. Let’s also try to find out where he stands on immigration, on some of the executive orders that have been issued. Let’s try to lock him on to not espousing radical views.' Try to find out where he stands on precedent. For example, hard question: He may personally disapprove of Roe v. Wade, but does he believe a new Supreme Court justice should vote to overturn a decision made so many years ago and that has become part of our jurisprudence? There’s some very good questions that could be asked. But in the end, I don’t think I would play tit-for-tat politics with the Supreme Court nominee., To hear more from Alan Dershowitz, tune in to Boston Public Radio above., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

1445,[Firing &amp; Hiring],"[It is a big day in federal legal circles, with a high profile departure from the Justice Department. Last night, President Trump fired the acting attorney general for refusing to defend his executive orders instituting a 90 day travel ban from seven majority Muslim countries and indefinitely suspending the relocation of Syrian refugees. Sally Yates is an Obama appointee who had been the acting attorney general while the senate confirmation of Senator Jeff Sessions played out. Yates instructed judiciary employees not to enforce Trump's executive order, believing it didn't pass constitutional muster.  Some Democrats are comparing Yates sudden termination to President Nixon's so-called 'Saturday Night massacre,’ when he fired his attorney general and deputy attorney general after they ignored his instructions to get rid of a special prosecutor during Watergate. The Trump administration says Yates “betrayed” the Justice Department by refusing to defend the ban., In addition, the country is awaiting a decision with the potential to influence just about every aspect of American life for decades to come – President Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court. SCOTUS justices are appointed for life and while tonight's nominee will replace a conservative, two of the older justices are liberal. Bader Ginsberg is now 83, Justice Stephen Breyer is 78 and Justice Anthony Kennedy –  a swing vote for liberals on abortion and affirmative action –  is 80 years old. There are reportedly two leading candidates. Massachusetts native Thomas Hardiman, currently an appeals court judge in Philadelphia, was raised in Waltham.  He is a big advocate of gun rights and would be the only justice who did not attend an Ivy League school.

1448,"[Walsh, Evans Plan To Work With Police Union On Body Camera Extension]","[As the embattled six-month police body camera pilot program nears completion, Boston Police Commissioner Bill Evans says he’s hoping to extend the trial and anticipates the cooperation of Boston’s largest police union., “We’ve started to talk to [Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association] and they haven’t really fought back on this,” Evans said during an interview with Boston Public Radio Tuesday. “They’ve seen how it’s used in a positive manner, whether it’s diffusing the crowd when they’ve been surrounded by angry crowds or having a gun arrest on video tape, I think they haven’t gotten a lot of complaints from their membership.”, Evans’ confidence in union cooperation comes after a long history of conflict; back in July, The union reached an agreement with the city to create a volunteer body camera program for police officers, yet — mysteriously — not one officer volunteered. Evans fired back with a mandatory six-month assignment, and the union responded by a lawsuit, requesting an injunction to prevent the mandatory program from going into effect. The request was denied by a Suffolk County Superior Court Judge, who cited the 1962 ‘Commissioner’s Statute’ which gives Evans unilateral power over how officers are deployed, and what equipment they wear — including cameras., “I never thought they were opposed so much to the whole idea, it’s just that change is tough to come by,” Evans told WGBH. “I think they’ve seen that it’s not such a bad thing.”, According to Evans, the extension would allow Northeastern University researchers more time to evaluate the benefits of body cameras, should they be permanently implemented year-round. “We’ve had it through more of the quieter months, not in the summer when we’re busiest,” he said. “If we extend it, it will give a better snapshot of every month of the year and how the officers interact.”, In an interview with Boston Public Radio on Jan. 24, Mayor Walsh, a former union leader, expressed his support for negotiation an extension on the pilot., “I think there’s an opportunity here for us to really kind of clean the slate a little bit, and since the program has been in place, I haven’t really heard a lot of pushback from officers — I think that’s key,” Walsh said. “... [Boston Police Union President] Pat Rose has an obligation as a union head to represent his members — I didn’t agree with the letter he wrote — but he has an obligation to push for his members. If we can all sit in a room and talk about doing a potential extension, it could be helpful.”, After 18 weeks, the department has captured 13,634 videos and 1,905 hours of footage, an average of 108 videos per day over the 100 officers included in the program, Evans announced during a City Council meeting Thursday night in Mattapan. “We got a lot of input from the community,” Evans said about the meeting. “Some people wanted it extended, some didn’t.”, When asked if he would take the union to court, should they resist the extension, Evans said, “If we decided, absolutely.”, To hear Commissioner Evans full interview with Boston Public Radio, click on the audio link above. , Tori Bedford (she/her/hers) is a reporter at WGBH News and produces the All Rev’d Up podcast.

1450,[Locals Remember John Kelly Before He Was White House Chief Of Staff],"[President Donald Trump has described John Kelly as one of the “stars” of the administration for his service over just six months as Secretary of Homeland Security, and today Trump used twitter to announce the retired four star general was his new chief of staff.  , Kelly grew up right here in Brighton, just down the road from the WGBH News studios. Back in January, not long after he’d been sworn in as Secretary of Homeland Security, I reached out to some distinguished locals, to get a sense of General Kelly’s Boston roots., I started with a childhood friend. William Galvin, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth, grew up alongside the young John Kelly, whose father was a postal worker in Brighton. The boys shared a daily commute from Boston to high school in Waltham, and Galvin remembers his friend having “a certain quick wit and charm which I assume he retains.” Brighton had fewer businesses and more residents in those days, and Galvin recalls it fondly as a place where neighbors knew each other. “It was a diverse community for its time in terms of different ethnicities easily commingling…. It was more mixed than many other neighborhoods of the city at the time. And it was a nice place to grow up.”  , John Kelly joined the Marine Corps in 1970, and after his discharge in 1972 he came home, graduating from UMass Boston in 1976. He re-enlisted in the corps, became an officer, and finished his career as Commander of the United States Southern Command. Tom Lyons is the Managing Director of Government Affairs &amp; Corporate Communications at MassHousing, and he’s known General Kelly for 25 years., “I’ve seen a guy from our hometown rise through the ranks to become a four-star general in the Marine Corps,” he said, “and all along the way, he never forgot his family, friends, in Brighton where he grew up”, That feeling seems to be pretty much shared by everyone who knows Kelly. Dan Magoon is a Boston firefighter, and combat veteran who founded Massachusetts Fallen Heroes, which honors those who have died in the war on terror since 9/11., Magoon says that in 2010, when they began organizing for a memorial, the first person he called was Kelly, who agreed to speak at a fundraiser that December.  “Unfortunately,” Magoon recalls, “in November of that year, we were notified that General Kelly’s son Robert had been killed in action in Southern Afghanistan.”, Kelly was now both a four-star general, and a gold star family member., But he still came to Boston for the Fallen Heroes event, delivering an inspiring speech about sacrifice. He didn’t mention his own loss. Tom Lyons says, “as a gold star family member, he knows how important his message is when he’s talking to people about the tragedies of war but also the importance of how we remember those that have given their lives for our freedom.” , Lyons tells a story he says reveals the depth of Kelly’s connection to Boston, and his commitment to those who serve., After the Boston Marathon Bombing, Lyons got a call from his old friend. “The general called me and said, as he usually does, ‘Lyons: I’m coming up on this day, I want you to get as many first responders who were at the marathon that day together, ‘cause I want to talk to them, I want to tell them how marvelous they are, I want to tell them what great Americans they are but I also want to tell them that as a marine who led marines in combat, if they need any support they have to reach out to family members or just reach out to someone who they can tell their story to.’ , ""And that, to me, said an awful lot about him caring about the people who are in public service,"" Lyons said., Lyons adds the men and women who work in homeland security — including his own son, an Immigrations and Enforcement Agent — are lucky to have the general’s support and guidance. , This post was updated on July 28, 2017., Arun Rath is the host of WGBH News' All Things Considered. ]"
1451,[The World Responds To Trump's Travel Ban],"[President Donald Trump’s travel ban is sparking protests nationwide and prompting a mostly negative response from the global community., World leaders have called the policy “insulting,” “cruel” and “divisive.” Many of the seven countries affected have released statements, as well as Britain, France, Germany, Canada, and Turkey. Australia was one of the few countries to defend Trump’s executive order., “This resonates around the world in a way I don’t think Americans have fully taken on board. The United States of America is a beacon for the whole world,” said Charlie Sennott, director of the GroundTruth Project, on Boston Public Radio today. “This is not who we are.”, The temporary ban bars travel from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Libya and Somalia for 90 days and closes the border to all refugees for 120 days. It bans refugees from Syria indefinitely., The president has denied claims the ban is racist, saying the order is designed to protect national security interests., “Donald Trump can say all day long this isn’t about a ban on Muslims,” Sennott said. “It is, and it really needs to be confronted.”, Critics have been quick to note Muslim-majority countries that have been excluded from the ban are some of those tied to Donald Trump through his business., For example, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey are excluded from the ban; Trump has golf courses in the UAE and two luxury towers in Turkey., Sennott also pointed out the administration’s ties to Saudi Arabia., “15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 came from Saudi Arabia,” he said. “Saudi Arabia has deep oil connections with people like Rex Tillerson, and Big Oil is absolutely in play in who we choose to be one of these countries [affected by the ban].”, Sennott said the order may backfire if ISIS decides to use it as a recruiting tool-- proof that the West mistreats its Muslim residents., “This plays into a narrative that Islamic extremists-- particularly ISIS-- around the world want to conflate their war, and say that the United States of America really is against all Muslims,” he said. “This feeds the fire of that argument and I really worry about that.”, Many American citizens see the order as a betrayal of national values. They say the U.S. was founded on the principles of freedom of religion and immigration has been a bedrock of the country., “The world is watching, and the world is observing that America has gone back on what was one of our greatest strengths,” Sennott said. “I think we really eroded and hurt our place in the world when we did that.”, Charlie Sennott is news analyst here at WGBH, where he also heads up The Ground Truth project.

1462,[Here's Where Boston Could See Cuts If Trump Pulls Federal Funds],"[
	On Wednesday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that could pull federal funding from so-called ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" like Boston that, in the order's words, ""willfully violate federal law in an attempt to shield aliens from removal from the United States.""
	 
	Boston Mayor Marty Walsh responded with defiance after Trump's announcement, vowing to shelter undocumented immigrants in his City Hall office if need be. ""If people want to live here, they’ll live here. They can use my office. They can use any office in this building,"" Walsh said as he stood flanked by city officials.
	 
	That stance could put $501 million in federal funds to various city departments on the line, but experts disagree over whether the federal government has the legal authority to follow through on that threat., , ""The federal government can't demand that state officials or local officials do their work,"" Barry Friedman, director of New York University's Policing Project, told NPR., “It appears to me, based on my review from case law, that there are severe limits on the federal government’s ability to control state and local entities by controlling the purse strings,” Susan Church, of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told The Boston Globe., Other experts disagree. The administration can use its vast federal spending powers to bring cities in-line with its interpretation of the law, according to Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, who has advised the Trump administration., ""The Trump administration can largely get the results it is seeking and a real meaningful end to most of these sanctuary policies through a combination of carrots and sticks,"" Vaughan told USA Today., The thorny legal issues involved could mean a long legal battle. In the meantime, Boston could stand to lose around $501 million in federal funding for public housing, schools, and other city departments, according to projections provided by the city for fiscal year 2017. Below is a breakdown of what that money is budgeted for., ,  , WGBH News reporter Tina Martin contributed to this story., Joshua Eaton is a freelance reporter who covers politics, security, and religion.]"
1463,[Crackdown On Sanctuary Cities Could Mean A Loss Of Millions In Mass.],"[Sanctuary cities in Massachusetts could face huge cuts if President Trump follows through on his threat to cut them off. This fiscal year, Boston’s getting a half billion dollars in federal grants that could be cancelled if police don’t cooperate in detaining people suspected of being in the country illegally., In Somerville, which is also considered a sanctuary city, Mayor Joe Curtatone estimates they get about $12 million in federal funds a year — about six percent of the city budget., “This is money that goes to fund programs around free and reduced-priced lunch programs to keep our kids from starving,"" Curtatone said. ""Special education, veterans and senior services, highway safety, homeland security projects — the very programs to help the most vulnerable populations.”, Despite the president’s threat, Curtatone says, Somerville isn’t going to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Other self-described sanctuary cities in the state include Amherst, Cambridge, Chelsea, Holyoke, Northampton, and Lawrence., The Trump administration is accusing these cities of deliberately violating federal law, according to WGBH legal analyst Daniel Medwed. “That it violates what’s called the supremacy clause,"" he said. ""And that withholding federal funds is not coercive, but rather a means of punishing states, in effect, for flouting federal law, and potentially [a way of] prompting cities to fall in line.”, The cities believe they’re not violating federal law because they’re not actually interfering with federal immigration policy, Medwed said. They’re just not cooperating., “So it boils down to a debate over the scope of federal power and whether the activities of sanctuary cities here are truly interfering with federal law or not,” he said., Jeff Beckwith of the Massachusetts Municipalities Association argues that it would be an economic burden for the federal government to require local police departments to hold people for up to two weeks for immigration reasons., “Say ICE doesn’t come for a week or two weeks. Who pays actually to keep that person in custody?"" he asked. ""It would be the local taxpayer [who] would pay for that. The city or the town would have to pay for that.”, Cities and towns could also be vulnerable to lawsuits for denying people due process if they hold anyone for longer than two days, Beckwith said., “So there’s an unfunded mandate,"" he explained, ""and there are real legal issues regarding whether or not communities can even take action that ICE would want to hold people until they get picked up.”, The vast majority Massachusetts municipalities haven’t challenged federal immigration rules. But Beckwith said they won’t gain if the sanctuary cities lose money. It just means less funding coming into the state for things like public safety and economic development., “If the federal government is going to come in with edicts that essentially impose not only unfunded mandates but punitive, extremely damaging penalties on communities if they don’t conform with the White House’s idea of how a community should be run, then that actually is a troubling development,"" Beckwith said. ""We’ve never had something like that before.”, Both Medwed and Beckwith agree that if the Trump administration does decide to hold back money, it’s all going to be argued — for years — in federal courts., Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

1465,[Where's The Fresh Food In Harvard Square? ],"[Harvard Square stands as a bustling intersection full of trendy restaurant chains, convenience shops and seasonal community festivities. One thing it lacks: a nearby fresh food supermarket., According to guidelines from the United States Department of Agriculture, Harvard Square is one of several areas in Massachusetts that can be categorized as food desert- a place with limited access to healthy, fresh and affordable food within a mile. Cradled adjacent to Harvard University and relatively close to heart of Cambridge, Harvard Square’s deficiency poses a challenge to students and residents alike., Stuart Dash, Director of Community Planning for the City of Cambridge spoke with WGBH’s Morning Edition host Bob Seay about how the city is planning to address this issue., Dash explains that the lack of space proves to be the biggest contribution to Harvard Square’s food accessibility plight. Dash says supermarkets seek to locate to high in-demand areas with lots of open space, allowing the capacity for a parking lot. Harvard Square possesses the qualities of an attractive retail location but lacks the wide space that supermarkets require., Dash says the Economic Development Division of the city’s Community Planning Department works actively to locate small, local businesses to meet the basic needs of the community. Dash says the department considers areas with vulnerable populations when scouting new locations for grocery stores looking to come to Cambridge. Transportation has been a primary focus in their efforts to help alleviate the issue of food insecurity. Dash also adds that city officials understand that there is a large part of the population who are constantly seeking alternatives to traveling long distances to access a supermarket., , Dash explains that while there are no current negotiations in the works for the arrival of a closer supermarket, Broadway Market stands as the closest grocery store- within about a 0.4 mile distance.  The square also offers several seasonal farmer’s markets throughout the growing season. Dash says the  Food and Fitness Policy Council, a city-wide, cross-departmental committee, is constantly working to find a more permanent solution to food inaccessibility for all Cambridge residents.  , Cambridge’s low-income residents, considered most vulnerable to food insecurity, are provided federal aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. This government funded assistance program provides subsidized groceries for low-income residents whom apply. The City of Cambridge’s SNAP match program provides a one-for-one match for every dollar spent at a local farmer’s market associated with the Cambridge SNAP Match Coalition. The state’s Department of Agricultural Resources says the match program was created to encourage EBT/SNAP users to shop at local farmers markets more frequently., State Republicans have expressed interest in cutting funding and blocking grants to the SNAP program prior to the ushering in of a new Republican president and Congress this year. Many state Democrats fear possible alterations or cuts the program may experience and what it will mean for the thousands of people in the Bay State who depend on it. Dash declined to comment on how President Trump may or may not alter the program but said that the city of Cambridge will continue to accept SNAP coupons and provide healthy food choices at places where food stamps are accepted., Ciku Theuri is a former Associate Producer for WGBH’s Morning Edition.]"
1466,[Celebrity Photographer Roger Farrington Unveils Special Boston Exhibit],"[WGBH’s midday news anchor Henry Santoro … the host of Henry In The Hub… sat down with well-known Boston Celebrity Photographer Roger Farrington to discuss his upcoming photography exhibit, Roger Farrington: Celebrity in Boston, 1976-1996. To listen to the extended audio interview, click on the audio file above., Henry Santoro: Opening at Boston's Panopticon photographic Gallery and the Commonwealth hotel, is a one man show featuring the work of Roger Farrington. Who's Roger Farrington, you ask? Well he's been taking photos of Bostonians and internationally-known celebrities since the mid 70s. He's one of those guys who seems to be everywhere capturing some unique moments in time. And it's my pleasure to welcome Roger to Henry and the Hub to Weekend Edition. Morning!, Roger Farrington:  Morning, great to see you again Henry., HS: Great to see you, Roger. Always a pleasure. This exhibit features 50 photographs from the hundreds of thousands of negatives that you have. How do you winnow it down?, RF: Well that's the big question and it's taken us a little bit a little while, but I've been working with Jason Landry from the gallery and Jim Fits, who's a former curator of the photographic Resource Center in Boston, literally for a full year. But we go back five years before, that when I had an exhibit of my John Lennon photos that I took in New York, and they helped me put that together after a book came out explaining how the Double Fantasy record was made. And I said, ‘well, you know, I probably have a few other shots of celebrities, and we started the process of going through the negatives., HS: And you must have come across probably hundreds of photographs that you forgot you even had!, RF: I printed about 97 different images and we went out it down to about 50, 51., HS: How did you get started in photography?, RF: Well I think college… photographing various things ,shows, entertainment things that were happening on campuses. I even did high school yearbook stuff; kind of self-taught. I picked up classes, workshops in college and in the summertime I even took a course in NESOP when it started in Kenmore Square; great place still there. And I just started shooting people more than anything else. And I did my fair share of weddings, certainly, after college, but it was when I was started to work at the Charles Playhouse in 1976 that it became apparent to me that I should bring my camera with me everyday to work-, HS: Because big time celebrities were coming through there., RF: Yes. And the comedy connection was just opening up in there. That was one of the very beginnings of comedy in Boston which as you know went on to be the same. And so a lot was happening in Boston at the time and I think I was sort of there as everything kind of began. And as I say, the Charles Playhouse was a very cool place to be in the early mid 70s early 80s., HS: You and I actually were fixtures on the scene for a while., RF: Yes., HS: Is it the job of the photographer to blend in with the background and sort of not let anybody know you're there?, , RF: Completely. And I think that's certainly the tact I took when I was starting out, is that you just try to be invisible, be part of the gang, fit in as best you can, and whatever, whatever the feeling in the room is …sometimes there's tension in the room. Sometimes they see a camera, so you don't take a picture at that time you wait for the appropriate moment. And that's an instinct that I think has held me in good stead., HS: How do you know when you've got the shot?, F: Well that's a great question, Henry, because when we were shooting film course you never knew, you never knew. And that's been part of the fun. I mean really that's been the real joy of putting this together because most of the shots I took were for certain press purposes, and I would get those shots, those might be posed and that I might keep shooting. And I never printed those little gems of that person while they were leaving the room. Raquel Welch was the last shot on the roll leaving the press conference.  She has a beautiful smile and it was the only genuine moment that I saw., HS: Back in the late 70s, Beatle John Lennon took five years off from making music so that he could raise his son, Sean. Then, in 1980 when he was ready to go back the recording studio and record what would be his final album, Double Fantasy, you got a call asking you to be the official photographer for the project.  How did that all happen? I mean, why you?, RF: Well that's a big question too, Henry. I guess I've never told you the whole story but I think secrecy was the number one issue at that time., HS: They didn't want a New York photographer., RF:  Right. What I heard was that everything was sort of being outsourced. What I've learned since is remarkable, when Ken Sharp did the book that I was involved in…that was six, seven years ago now. He interviewed every single person involved. And suddenly I really figured it out for the first time. But we were all vetted for things, like our birthdates, when we were born. We had to pass the astrology test for Yoko and John, which I had., HS: You had to be a cosmically good fit!, RF: Absolutely. That was true. And if you want the answer, that could be the answer! But yes, they wanted a photographer who was not connected to any media outlets. They wanted a photographer who could shoot and get the stuff out to the world because I'd had a photo in Time Magazine early on, too. So I had the chops but it was a job that I'm sure other people might not have wanted because there was no guarantee I was going to get in the door. There was no guarantee that I could say “oh, I'm with John Lennon. I'm his photographer.” That was not part of the arrangement. So it was it was pretty tricky., HS: Those shots are absolutely stunning. And in part because John Lennon was as handsome, probably the most handsomest he's ever been, in that setting. He was just dressed in black. He had this really cool hat. And of course the John Lennon glasses. And you just captured every moment., RF: Well thank you. It's really nice to hear. He was great. He was so energized and, again, when the book came out. More of that information made it clear, what my thinking was at the time, that he was really ready to go. He was so excited, the band jelled and and they had a really exciting first day. And I remember like ‘well I got enough shots and they want these to be used to announce that they're in the recording studio. I better leave right now!’ Because I felt responsible to get the message out. And when I was leaving, I probably could have stayed longer, I probably could listen to the whole session. So I kind of regret that today., HS: And then in 1985, Andy Warhol came to Boston. I know this because I was one of only three people who got to interview him, but you got to photograph him on Boston's Newbury Street, no less, and that photo is in the show.  How did that photo come to be?, , RF: Well again, I probably have a picture of you somewhere in the background there, Henry, I better go take a look. It was one of those things that, as best I recall, it was a that last minute thing I heard. I didn't know he was coming well in advance. I think I may have only had a few hours notice, and I know because I brought with me a roll of film that was already in the camera that had another job on it. So, I remember arriving right at the moment when he was coming in. So, I was able to get a couple of shots on the straight that are absolutely out of focus, and then get just ahead of him as he came into the gallery. And it was packed, and I just happened to be very close up front, that when he came in he was literally five, six feet in front of me so my recollection was that, you know, I got one shot that I could use for the newspaper. But I really didn't get that really quintessential Andy Warhol photo. But looking back at the negatives, I found a couple of em’.  Yeah, there it was. And after all these years it was great to print it., HS: Who else are you excited to see in this exhibit?, RF: Well, so many of them really were surprises… the Richard Pryor shot when he came to Boston in 1978. I'm sort of proud of that shot because the tension in the room was really intense. This white kid with a camera during a very difficult time in Boston history, and Richard Pryor was great but it was tense and I'm glad that's in the show. I have to give a shout out to Liza Minnelli and Mark Gero because I went to college with Mark Gero, and when he married Liza Minnelli, we were all very impressed. So it was fun to put that in the show too. So many shots you know, Richard Avedon. I was absolutely in awe of his work long before I met him and he came to the CIA for his in the ‘American West Show,’ which was only I think in three galleries in the United States. It was a pleasure to meet him and spend some time with him. The Wang Center film Series, that was a wonderful opportunity Boston had so many great celebrities came to Boston. Lee Remick, Jack Lemmon, Charlton Heston. It was so much fun in those days., HS: Do you have get yourself in a certain frame of mind when photographing celebrities as opposed to just going out and getting those candid shots?, RF: I think you do. But I think everything seemed so connected and fast paced. I was definitely on a roll for a long long time., HS: You were everywhere., RF: I just kept going! I was like the energizer bunny! And I would shoot, you know, something during the day, I would shoot something at night, or two things at night, and it would be, you know, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or you know, I would not really have a day off. And I'd be printing because we you had to develop the film. So I'd be up early developing printing, making deadlines. It was amazing, and it went on for 20 years., HS: Very cool. Well Roger Farrington’s one-man show opens at Boston's Panopticon Gallery in the Commonwealth Hotel. You do not want to miss this show, you absolutely want to see these celebrities in Boston up close and right there on the wall; the show is up until April. And yes, limited prints are available correct?, RF: Yes they are. Thank you., HS: So, Roger thanks so much great to see you., RF: Great to see you, see you at the opening!]"

The town of Arlington has recently been weighing whether it wants to pass a resolution to designate it a “sanctuary town,” but there is now a lot more at stake in that decision., The Arlington Human Rights Commission and many town residents are behind the proposals to make their community a sanctuary town., The Board of Selectmen held a meeting Monday to address the matter. In her testimony, resident Meghan Bailey said she was opposed to President Trump’s stance on undocumented immigrants., “I don’t want him to break up this community by threatening to round up immigrants through racial profiling, detention and deportation,” Bailey said., As far as Arlington police chief, Fred Ryan, is concerned, his department already acts like it is in a sanctuary town, underscoring that it isn’t in their jurisdiction to enforce immigration laws., “We don’t train our police officers to enforce immigration laws. We don’t ask people their immigration status—ever. The only time it comes up is when somebody is under arrest for a crime,” Ryan said., On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer made it clear it sees no role for communities providing any special help to undocumented immigrants.,  “We’re going to strip federal grant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants,"" he said."", This kind of threat puts the town of Arlington in a tough spot as it considers joining roughly nine communities in Massachusetts that have vowed to protect law-abiding undocumented residents from stringent federal immigration laws. Arlington is at risk of losing $5 million in federal funding, which according to town manager Adam Chapdelaine, would affect the town’s most vulnerable population., “That money goes towards programming at the Housing Authority for homework aid to low-income students,” he said. “It goes to support senior citizen services. It goes toward the promotion of affordable housing. So, it’s really focused on the people that need the help most in town.”, Chapdelaine is of two minds—one’s in favor of protecting the budget, the other protecting the town’s values., “My job is to balance the budget and provide services, so I am concerned about losing funding,” said Chapdelaine. “On the community side, I completely understand the concerns of the community and the want for our community’s values to match up with our community’s policies.”, This story was updated on Jan. 30., Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

What’s that about?, OTTESSA MOSHFEGH: It’s hard to see yourself blown up in a picture like that in the newspaper., BRAUDE: How about a tiny picture on the book jacket?, MOSHFEGH: I never wanted my picture on the books. I find it weird that people can see what I look like. The whole point of being an author is I’m invisible. If I wanted to be a movie star that would be another thing…I hate having my picture taken. I hate it., MARGERY EAGAN: You wrote a book, ""Eileen""...tell us how that came to be., MOSHFEGH: I grew up in New England and I write a lot about New England. I’ve written two novels set in new England. My first was my first book ""McGlue,"" which takes place in 1850 about this drunken sailor from Salem. So New England has always been looming huge in my imagination. It’s where I grew up. It’s where I learned how to be, in many ways. I left because I hate the winter. I moved to California about six years ago. So when I sat down to write ""Eileen,"" I wanted a character that felt captive in her environment, and there was nothing more oppressive to me when I thought about New England in the winter where you can barely get out the driveway. That’s where ""Eileen"" started., JIM BRAUDE: For ""Eileen,"" I read you followed something called the ""90-Day Novel,"" by Alan Watt., MOSHFEGH: It’s a true story, but I think it’s an easily misinterpreted story. I started out as an experimental writer. Playing with form and structure and language in ways that aren’t necessarily commercial. When I was 30, 31 I moved to L.A. and I was completely broke. I knew I wanted to be a writer. I knew I had to be a writer, that it was who I was and I didn’t want to have to get a job that would take up my whole day so I had no time or energy to write when I got home. I thought, in this very Victorian way, actually, I should write a novel so I could sell it and make a little bit of money., Though it seemed like a ridiculous idea, it was also a huge creative challenge. I had written a novella before, I had never written anything that long. I had never thought about the structure of a novel in any kind of formal way, I just absorbed them and loved them. I found this book, ""The 90 Day Novel,"" and took it on as an experiment. What would happen if a weirdo writer like me decided to write a commercially viable novel? It turned out I didn’t exactly do that. It’s not a perfect, three-act structure the way you see Hollywood movies work. But it was really interesting as an experiment and I learned a lot from writing the book…, I ended up with a terrible book. No offense to ""The 90 Day Novel,"" but you can’t crank out a book and it be good in 60 or 90 days. There’s a lot of editing. I ended up rewriting it several times but that was part of a creative experiment. I didn’t pull it out of a hat., BRAUDE: You write a lot about dysfunctional women, and we are all fine reading about dysfunctional men or men like this. That we’re comfortable or used to. But we’re not so comfortable reading about women similarly situated., MOSHFEGH: Why is that?, BRAUDE: That’s my question. In your story ""Bettering Myself,"" Miss Mooney has some issues. I was wondering if Miss Mooney was Mr. Mooney, how would I have felt differently? I haven’t resolved that kind of thing yet., MOSHFEGH: We’re sexist as readers, definitely., BRAUDE: How do you get around that?, MOSHFEGH: Oh, I don’t care. People are going to be sexist, they’re going to be racist, they’re going to have expectations and I’m going to write whatever I want to write…, I think we’re uncomfortable with women who are dysfunctional because we’ve all had mothers and we want women to be caretakers. It’s a really easy button to press on somebody, the moment a woman is not hospitable. We get really uncomfortable., To hear more from author Ottessa Moshfegh, tune in to Boston Public Radio above.

So we give any sorts of grants upwards of 35,000 in a case like that that’s a handicap van and you have to spend a little bit more to provide the vehicle ..and then smaller amounts to cover some utilities to help people get back on their feet can be as small as 200 and 300.”, While the Letters Foundation operates with a strict budget, there is no budget when it comes to giving Tevis said., “If anyone has worked closely with Doris she always speaks about how she wants her last check to bounce.”, The Buffet family is also very hands on.

1480,"[LISTEN: Cambridge City Councilor On Trump Order To End Federal Funding Of ""Sanctuary Cities""]","[
	President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at slashing federal funding for so-called ""sanctuary cities.""
	 
	There are several such cities in Massachusetts, including Boston, Somerville, Cambridge and Chelsea.
	 
	Local leaders, including Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and Somerville Mayor Joe Curtatone, are denouncing Trump's order and saying they will do what they can to protect their residents - regardless of their immigration status.
	 
	Cambridge was one of the first sanctuary cities, adopting the status back in 1985. Cambridge City Councilor Marc McGovern spoke with WGBH All Things Considered host Barbara Howard about how Trump's order could affect his city.
	 , ""There are certain responsibilities that the federal government has, and then there's certain responsibilities that local law enforcement has. Our view, and the view of our police commissioner, is that it is not the job of local law enforcement to track down people who might be illegal immigrants. If someone is arrested for a crime, and it turns out that they are an illegal immigrant, then the federal government is notified of that. But the Cambridge police do not regularly ask people their immigration status and don't make it their duty to go out and find people."", ""It's very important that we are a welcoming community to all people. and I think in this time in particularly under this administration it is going to be more important than ever that local municipalities stand up and protect particularly minority groups because as we can tell from this administration - just even in its first few days - that certain groups of people are going to be under attack by this administration."", ""One of the first things I did after President Trump was elected was to not only reaffirm our commitment in Cambridge to being a sanctuary city, but also to ask our city manager to start preparing to fund programs that may be cut should the president follow through with this action. We get about 14 million in federal funding and that goes to everything from helping to pay for school lunches, to money that goes towards homelessness, that goes towards housing. It would affect a variety of programs."" , Barbara Howard is the former anchor of WGBH’s All Things Considered. ]"
1481,"[Juliette Kayyem: Trump's Executive Action On The Wall Fulfills A Campaign Promise, But Is Short On Details]","[Today, President Donald Trump signed an executive order ordering the ""immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border"" with Mexico., It was a promise he made repeatedly on the campaign trail, but homeland security expert and host of ""The SCIF"" podcast Juliette Kayyem said the order does little to lay out a concrete plan about where the wall will go or how it will be funded., ""It's a big nothing,"" she told Boston Public Radio Wednesday., ""It will not have details on where the wall will be built, because there's nowhere to build it, and it won't have any money tied to it, and it certainly won't require Mexico to pay,"" Kayyem said., There is already over 650 miles of border wall in place from previous administrations. Kayyem said geographical barriers and objection from neighboring American states have made constructing additional miles difficult., ""Where there's no wall is because you have a mountain or river, [or] it's tribal lands, which raises other issues, or because the state—in most cases, a red state like Arizona or Texas—doesn't want it there, for a variety of reasons including commercial agricultural reasons,"" she said., Funding the wall is another point of contention. While Trump promised on the campaign trail that Mexico would pay for it, he now says U.S. taxpayer dollars will be used for construction, to be reimbursed by Mexico at a later date. Mexico has rejected that idea., Kayyem was skeptical that Trump would be able to secure Mexican reimbursement for U.S. taxpayer funds. She pointed to Trump's meeting with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto in September of last year, after which the then-candidate Trump said he and Nieto had discussed the wall but not who would pay for it., ""He talks tough, and then he gets into a room with the Mexican president and doesn't mention the wall,"" Kayyem said., To hear more from Juliette Kayyem, tune in to Boston Public Radio above., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

1483,"[When It Comes To Mass. State Liquor Laws, There's A Thirst For Change]","[,  , In the kitchen of Seven Star Street Bistro in Roslindale, owner and chef Chris Lin cooks up a wide range of cuisine, from Asian standbys like Ma Po tofu at dinner to American brunch fare during the day. But if you visit Seven Star, you won't be able to have an alcoholic drink with your meal — even though he says many customers would like to., ""Last night ... we had customers sit down, and when they realized we didn’t have liquor, they ended up taking their food to go,"" Lin says. ""Which we totally understand."", In Boston, the demand for liquor licenses far outpaces the supply — and the state, not the city, strictly controls the creation of new ones., A few years back, Lin considered buying a liquor license on the resale market. But he balked at the cost, which can range anywhere from $50,000 for a beer-and-wine license to $400,000 for a license that allows proprietors to serve beer, wine, and booze., Later, when Boston released a new batch of licenses, Lin thought he’d locked one up. But he was stymied at the last minute., ""They were only designated for areas in economic need, or Main Streets districts,"" Lin says, referring to a special development designation employed by the city., ""We happen to fall two blocks out of a Main Streets district, so we didn’t qualify. I was very upset, because I thought with the support we had behind us it was, like, a slam dunk."", That rejection also meant the loss of what could have been a key source of revenue., ""I’ve been in the restaurant industry all my life,"" Lin says. ""I’ve worked at restaurants and seen restaurants who really are only financially viable based off of their ability to sell liquor. Food does not make them any money whatsoever."", Lin eventually purchased a beer-and-wine license secondhand, for an unusually low price, but ended up selling it when he needed extra capital. Now he hopes to land one of Boston’s new bring your own bottle, or BYOB, licenses — customer-friendly, he says, but not lucrative., As he waits, he dreams of an alternate reality where serving alcohol with food is no big deal., ""I wish a normal person, a business owner like myself, could go to City Hall and apply for a license — and as long as I take on my responsibility as a business owner, and I’m responsible for my license, I should be able to own and maintain that license,"" Lin says., In the future, that vision could actually come to pass. State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg, who controls alcohol regulation in Massachusetts, is forming a new task force charged with sizing up existing alcohol laws that date to just after Prohibition., ""Basically, everything is on the table,"" Goldbeg says., Wide-ranging reform of the state's alcohol status quo could also be good news for Ian Hunter and Jesse Brenneman, who make handcrafted gin and two types of rum at Deacon Giles Distillery in Salem., ""The state franchise laws are first and foremost in our mind,"" Brenneman says, referring to laws that govern the relationship between producers like Deacon Giles and the wholesalers who distribute their products across the state., Under existing law, Hunter says, the producer is in a weak position if the relationship with their wholesaler goes sour., ""It’s very hard to terminate that relationship once it’s established,"" Hunter says. ""It’s very costly. It involves a lot of lawyers and a lot of time."", Hunter and Brenneman also suggest a reduction in the red tape required to make and pour spirits. Hunter recalls giving the state a wealth of information to get a license to manufacture gin and rum then sending that same info a second time to get clearance to sell drinks made from those spirits in an on-site pour room., ""We essentially submitted all the same information, from financial data to personal information, for our pouring permit, which we couldn’t require unless we had our distillery permit,"" he says., Streamlining processes like that might not prompt an outcry. But other shifts in the liquor status quo could — for example, from people who already own a valuable Boston liquor license or from liquor wholesalers reluctant to give up their clout., The good news for people like Lin, Hunter, and Brenneman is that Goldberg thinks the status quo is untenable., ""This is for real,"" she says of her new reform push. ""This isn’t so we can say, 'OK, we did that, good, here’s a couple recommendations and we can move on.' I’m looking at a 21st century industry."", If she gets it, business involving alcohol could be done very differently than it is today.,  , Adam Reilly is a reporter at WGBH-TV's Greater Boston.]"

Â ,  âAnyone know how long [Mandela] was in jail?â Chaffee calls out., A handful of students reply, â27 years.â, This is just a glimpse of the class curriculum, which centers on social justice and injustice dating back to 1492. Itâs a collaborative classroom where Chaffee urges students to think critically and problem solve together., âI try to create an environment where itâs OK to be wrong,â says Chaffee. âThatâs how we get smarter, and then normalize it, weâre a community, weâre a team, letâs be nice to each other.

I love the fact that we really focus on building relationships with kids, that we see kids as whole people.â Chaffee said., This mutual respect and admiration is palpable. Chaffee jokes around with her students but sheâs toughâ one of the reasons why Thabiti Brown, head of the school, nominated her for Massachusetts Teacher of the Year., âSydney is very lovable,â says Brown. âWarm personality, big heart. You combine that with her ability to perform and a deep knowledge of content and her deep knowledge of pedagogy and it makes for a really great teacher.â, Chaffee has fused her passion for social justice and experiential learning by partnering with the Huntington Theater Company, where students explore the themes they learn in class onstage. This project is one of the reasons she became a finalist to be national teacher of the year. But what students like 9th grader Jordyn Davis tell meâitâs more than that., âShe is a mother figure to me and itâs just, like, sheâs been there.

I think there’s a view of America that was revealed in the language of President Trump’s inaugural address that was just very unusual.”, Sennott explained that though Trump’s message was bleak, it contained some bipartisan truths about states in the middle of the country that have been overlooked. He said drawing the public’s attention toward those left behind, despite a surge in innovation in the U.S., is a part of “the brilliance of Trump.”, “It’s really important to remember not to get so wildly divided and partisan that we overlook some of the deep truths that were in that messaging, even though it was pretty dark in the way it was expressed,” said Sennott, Despite the surprise around the world at Trump’s inauguration speech, similar movements are afoot in Europe, said Sennott, as evidenced by the Brexit vote and the upcoming French presidential election., “The way President Trump has articulated the values that he holds in this new spirit of change that he wants to bring to the country is something that’s really resonating in Europe,” Sennott said. “The far-right is on the rise in Europe.”, He was also quick to point out that despite the popularity of the movement championed by Trump, some aspects of his ascension should raise red flags., “There are elements of watching the way this administration is dealing with the media that absolutely remind me of authoritarian regimes I’ve covered all over the world,” he said. “It’s like a playbook.”, Charlie Sennott is a news analyst at WGBH and heads up the GroundTruth Project.

Among them: Ben and Laura Soussan, who drove to D.C. from their home in Hampton, New Hampshire., ""I'm not often speechless. I'm speechless,"" said Laura Soussan as she walked into the ballroom. ""He did it. We're here. It's like the fairy tale."", She was dressed for the moment in a sparkling gown. Soussan describes the color as ""Trump gold"". She booked the hotel for the weekend a year and a half ago, began asking for tickets to the ball before then-candidate Trump had even won a primary. They met him many times because at each of his New Hampshire rallies, they showed up to volunteer. It gave them enough access that they both have iPhones filled with photos of themselves posing with Trump., ""How many people can say I've met the president?"" asked Ben Soussan. ""He shook our hands. He knows our faces."", In some ways, the Ball was not that different from a campaign event. The goal was to get as close as possible to the star of the show. The Soussans made their way to a lit stage at one of end of the cavernous room and found a spot near the front to wait for the president to appear. It gave them a bird's-eye view of the entertainment. The Rockettes were probably the best known performers. A-list celebrities stayed away from President Trump's inauguration. The Soussans view the rejection of Trump—from entertainers, politicians, and anyone else—as largely irrelevant.  , ""Even the protesters are going to benefit,"" said Ben Soussan, referring to the many protest groups who filled Washington, D.C.'s streets during Inauguration Day. ""They're going to benefit from Trump just like we are."", ""If you think standing on a street corner and stamping your feet is going to do something, you're misguided,"" said Laura Soussan. ""Take action, be part of a committee, run for office yourself."", The Soussans say part of the fun of the inauguration was being around so many like-minded people. Yet, they pride themselves in also being able to put politics aside. They were looking forward to stopping in New York City on their way home and sharing a meal with a cousin whom they describe as a ""big liberal."" , ""But we'll have a good time together,"" said Laura Soussan., Dinner was not quite the perfect ending to their fairy tale weekend. The cousin had been part of the Women's March in New York City.

1502,[Fresh Voices Energized The Pre-March Rally On Boston Common],"[The easy-going tone at the Boston Women’s March for America began with the soundcheck., “I’m really not that funny,” said the man at the podium, after he switched his “check one-two” to a “check two-one,” a move met with applause and audible laughter., From that point on, speakers’ voices echoed across a very responsive audience of more than 100,000 people gathered in the Common. (The crowd eventually grew to an estimated 125,000.), The crowd was peppered with pink hats, American flags, and creative signs-- “Cinnamon Rolls, Not Gender Roles,” and “Grab Him By The Putin” among the many puns spotted., The speakers included Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Senator Ed Markey and Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, but some of the most rousing speeches were by lower-profile individuals and groups., The Boston Children’s Chorus sang “God Bless America” but instead of the original lyrics, sang “And crown thy good with sisterhood,” smiling with each other afterword as they reveled in extended applause from the audience., After their song, the master of ceremonies, Mariama White-Hammond, a minister at Bethel AME Church in Boston, asked the crowd to acknowledge the deaf community in the crowd, and a sea of hands went up in visual applause. She also asked that everyone in the crowd affirm a stranger using eye contact, a means of bringing in people with autism or anxiety., Signs from the crowd descended and flags stopped waving as everyone listened enraptured to the Cherokee version of “Amazing Grace” sung by Savannah Fox Tree, daughter of Claudia Fox Tree, a professional educator of Arawak descent., The crowd listened to speeches, cheered frequently and bobbed up and down to Mary J. Blige’s “Real Love,” which wove itself between speakers as they entered and left the stage., One of the marchers, Sunindia Bhalla of Boston, said she was pleasantly surprised to hear from Senator Ed Markey., “We always hear how vocal Elizabeth Warren is, and it’s nice to hear how Mike Capuano and all of our legislators are really aligned and have the same views,” said Bhalla., The Senator Markey brought up other legislators on stage with him and reminded the crowd that Boston has been the birthplace of a number of movements-- from the revolutionary war to abolition., Many speakers highlighted the progressive history of the Bay State, and the organizers clearly made an effort to achieve intersectionality between different movements., This effort likely came in the wake of criticisms of the national movement, the Women's March on Washington., Some have spoken out saying the Washington organizers failed to adequately represent and include people of color., The program organized in Boston seemed to fly in the face of that criticism., “The intersectionality of so many movements and of feminism...It’s just been an inspiring, inspiring day,” said Ayanna Pressley, Boston City Councilor-at-Large., Pressley said she is proud, after the speeches and demonstration, to represent Boston and to be a resident of the city., “We have an embarrassment of riches here in Massachusetts,” she said. “Boston showed up and showed out today.”, For a list of all the speakers from the Boston Women’s March for America, click this link., Molly Boigon is a former associate producer and reporter for Learning Curve, WGBH’s K-12 education desk.

But Kennedy – with his mother Sheila Rauch, wife Lauren Birchfield, and one year-old daughter Eleanor – joined roughly 125,000 protesters gathered on Boston Common Saturday at the Boston Women’s March for America., Not surprisingly, Kennedy was disappointed with the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump., “[Trump] had an opportunity to try and unite a country, while he had the world watching him, and decided not to do that,” Kennedy said. “It’s extraordinarily disappointing and disheartening, and it’s up to us to make sure he understands that there are an awful lot of people out there that don’t share those views, that are willing to stand up for each other, that are willing to fight for each other, and fight for our country. I think the statement today is pretty loud and clear.”, When asked if his intention was to protest President Trump, Kennedy, a Democrat, said he was keeping a watchful eye., “I’m not a fan of the new president, he ran a campaign that I think is against an awful lot of values that I believe in,” he said. “I think my job is to stand up for those values where we can, and if he tries to reach out to people that don’t necessarily share some of his views and recognize that he’s now the president of 320 million Americans, and not just the 60 million that voted for him, then great.

Those issues, for the most part, represent the antithesis of Donald Trump’s nationalist agenda: equal pay for equal work, reproductive choice, police and criminal justice reform., , The nation’s largest gathering was in Washington, DC where an estimated 500,000 rallied. Dublin, London, Berlin and hundreds of other cities saw crowds dominated by women, but containing sizable numbers of men. All told, estimates of world-wide participation hit 3 million., One thing seemed to be almost universal, though: The pink knitted caps known as ""pussyhats"" among the marchers, in protest of Trump's past comments about women., Among the elected officials on the Boston stage were U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, and Attorney General Maura Healey., The prevailing mood was positive, upbeat, celebratory – and occasionally funky and sassy., Throughout the crowd, there was no mistaking the resolve to oppose much of the Trump agenda and resist the efforts of the Republican controlled Congress to move the nation in a more conservative direction., “Organized people will overcome organized money every time,” said Carol Rose, the ACLU Massachusetts executive director., Sen. Warren, with full-throated feistiness vowed, “We will not build a stupid wall.”, Even more animated than Warren was Mayor Walsh who – in the course of calling on the crowd to all become activists – said, “It’s not what we do today that matters, it’s what we do tomorrow.”, ""Donald Trump has a dream,"" warned Sen. Markey, ""that one day our nation will have no more Muslims, or mosques, or Social Security or Planned Parenthood."", At day's end the organizers of the march issued the following statement, claiming an even higher total of participants: ""Today, we were so proud to stand in solidarity with 175,000 people in Boston. United by more than 600 sister marches happening throughout the world, we sent a clear message to elected leaders that we are a country that stands for equality, dignity and justice. We thank the City of Boston, all public safety officials, and our thousands of marchers for a peaceful, positive event."", In terms of events such as the Women's March For America, it's rhetorical to say that a crowd is massive and people are spread out as far as the eye can see, but in Washington DC this was literal., The event grew from humble origins — a simple Facebook invitation after Election Day — to the much more massive demonstration seen Saturday. By the time marchers hit the streets, the Women's March on Washington developed a broad platform of progressive political positions, a slate of celebrity performers and a series of sister marches planned across the world — on all seven continents., Tori Bedford (she/her/hers) is a reporter at WGBH News and produces the All Rev’d Up podcast.

1507,[Two Mass. Organizers Discuss The Women's March On Washington],"[A day after the pomp and circumstance of President Trump’s inauguration, millions of women will descend on Washington, D.C., for what could be the largest ever protest in response to a presidential inauguration. WGBH’s Marilyn Schairer interviewed Tammy Gouveia, a lead organizer for the Massachusetts chapter of the Women's March on Washington, and Natasha Chabria, the lead organizer in Boston and a law student at Northeastern University. Below is a lightly edited transcript of their conversation., I understand up to 9,300 women from Massachusetts are planning to attend the march in D.C. What's the purpose of the march?, Gouveia: The purpose of the march is really to come together in solidarity and have our voices heard — that women's rights are human rights, and that we want to continue to build on the progress that we've made in this country over the last hundred years in terms of women's rights and rights across all spectrums for social justice and equity for all., So what exactly have you been doing to get more women involved?, Chabria: As the Boston lead organizer, I've been reaching out to colleges and universities to really get students involved, and we've kind of been reaching across generationally and across diverse communities to really get all women and all allies involved in this., Natasha, what have some of the younger women been saying to you?, Chabria: That's actually been something that's been really exciting after this election cycle. A lot of people were down. But what I noticed was that young people were really starting to arise from the woodwork. So people were coming out and saying, you know, I've been thinking about these issues for a while. These are really important to me. How do I help? How do I get involved in making change that will not only impact me but future generations? So that's been really, really exciting., Are men taking part in the marches?, Gouveia: Absolutely. Men and women, and people who identify as gender non-conforming or non-binary. We have a lot of folks who are transgender, lesbian, gay, and bisexual folks. People from all different religious backgrounds are marching — both in Washington, D.C., and also there are three hundred sister marches happening across the globe. So it's a very broad, diverse spectrum of folks. This is really intergenerational. We have been hearing from so many people that they are marching with their grandparents or with their grandchildren or their nieces and that kind of thing. So it's really an opportunity for the younger generation to learn from what previous generations have really been fighting for in terms of human rights. And it's an opportunity for those who have been fighting for so long to feel like the fight is continuing and that people are picking up that torch and saying, ""Yep, there's still a lot more for us to do in terms of social justice in this country."", Now there is some concern that this might be misconstrued as an anti-Trump march. How would you respond to that if someone said, ""You're raining on his parade. It's his time. He's now the president.""?, Gouveia: We've heard that from a lot of folks. This is not an anti-Trump rally. This is a pro-human rights and a pro women's rights march. And what we say to folks is that we are marching on this first day because we are at a very pivotal point in our society, in our country — installing a new president. We really do want the incoming administration to hear our voices, that we want to achieve social equity for everybody., You said there were 300 marches around the country. I know here in Massachusetts there are several planned as well. Boston has one. There's one out in Pittsfield, in Falmouth. What can people expect? Will there be speeches? Will you actually be marching? And will they be peaceful? I mean, some people have concerns about that. Natasha?, Chabria: I haven't gotten too much of a chance to interact with the leaders of those different movements. But from what I have heard and what I've learned, it seems like they're really going after the same goals that we are. This is supposed to be a peaceful, nonviolent protest to sort of echo the fact that these are human rights that we're all fighting for., Is this a movement that will remain active in Massachusetts, and around the country for that matter, throughout the presidency of Donald Trump?, Gouveia: Absolutely. I think even beyond whatever the next two to four years really look like, we are hearing from a lot of people who are forming their own different groups to sit down and figure out how do they want to impact policy and impact human rights at the local level. And we're hearing from a lot of people from all across the state that they really do want to continue this effort moving forward. The march is just a punctuation or a beginning point for that movement.,  , Marilyn Schairer is a reporter and producer for WGBH News., Ciku Theuri is a former Associate Producer for WGBH’s Morning Edition.]"

But he acknowledges that it will still be difficult for Democrats to block any of their confirmations., ""Let's be honest, GOP, in a modern era stands for 'Gas and Oil Party,'"" Markey told Boston Public Radio Thursday., ""To have any of these Republicans who are in the Senate break off from the party of orthodoxy in order to block any of these nominees is not going to be easy,"" he said., Markey has said he is particularly concerned about Pruitt, as well as Trump's nominee for Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson—former Exxon Mobil CEO—and former Texas Governor Rick Perry for Secretary of Energy., ""This is no longer the party of Teddy Roosevelt. It's no longer even the party of Richard Nixon, who created the E.P.A. in 1970. It's a completely different Republican Party, and we're going to have to fight as hard as we can,"" Markey said., Ironically, a rule change implemented by the Democrats themselves in 2013 is making their resistance to Trump's nominees now more difficult. Three years ago, Democrats voted to change Senate rules and lower the threshold for cabinet confirmations and federal judgeships from 60 to 51 votes. , But Markey says all the party can do now is look forward., ""Looking in a rearview mirror really isn't helpful. All we can deal with is what we've got right now, and for the time being at least, we've still got a 60 vote threshold for Supreme Court justices. We'll live with whatever it is we have to deal with right now,"" Markey said., To hear more from Senator Ed Markey, tune in to Boston Public Radio above., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

""We’ve never been in this situation before.”, Weingarten explained that DeVos’s track record has proven her preference for school privatization., “Her endgame has been making money off of public schools, and frankly, privatizing,” she said. “Others have said her endgame... was to displace public schools as the center of community and replace [them] with Christian education and with the kingdom of God.”, DeVos and her husband were recorded an interview in 2001 talking about changing the public school system instead of just donating money to Christian schools., Betsy DeVos said her hope was “to confront the culture in which we all live today in ways that will continue to help advance God’s Kingdom, but not to stay in our own faith territory.”, Weingarten talked about how for-profit charter schools, another school choice championed by DeVos, can disadvantage students., She said parents in districts with run-down public schools will choose the for-profit charter schools. The process further depletes resources for public schools, and benefits investors., “The privatizers get a twofer. They don’t have to spend money on public schools or public school kids, and at the same time they get the funding that was going to public schools for privatization,” she said. “And in Michigan, they’ve made a lot of profit off of it., Weingarten stressed the importance of public education, saying while some students have benefitted from charter schools and vouchers, many more have benefitted from public education., “There are millions of kids who would not have any opportunity but for a public education, and we want to lift up not only those kids, but also, every kid who hasn’t gotten a fair shake,” she said. “We want to make sure those parents have viable neighborhood public education choices.”, Randi Weingarten is President of the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.

1517,[Inauguration Boycotts: Justifiable Or Harmful To The Union? ],"[It’s probably not entirely a coincidence that the two members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation who are boycotting Friday’s presidential inauguration happen to represent the state’s two most Democratic-leaning districts (per the Cook Political Report’s ratings). Katherine Clark of Melrose was the very first member of Congress to announce her non-attendance, last week; some 50 others were on the bandwagon when Somerville’s Michael Capuano added his name Wednesday., Both Capuano and Clark can be a little, shall we say, pugnacious. Clark, in just her second term, helped plan and execute last summer’s congressional sit-in to protest the lack of gun-control legislation. Capuano, with a long history of scrappy politics, is rumored to be contemplating the end of his nearly two-decade run in the U.S. House of Representatives., When Clark, working with Georgia congressman John Lewis, pulled off that sit-in stunt, most of her Bay State colleagues were quick to join them. Not so with the Trump inaugural boycott, even though Lewis again took the symbolic lead—prompting a nasty Twitter attack on the civil-rights icon, from the President-elect, which deeply offended many of them., Listen to WGBH All Things Considered's host Barbara Howard's interview with Congresswoman Katherine Clark below. , , I think two things have been holding them back. One is Lewis’s explicit linking of his decision to boycott with his belief that Trump is not “a legitimate President,” due to the alleged Russian meddling., That’s a bridge too far for most voters, and a grave offense to many. Individual members can, and have, expressed their own, differing reasons for boycotting. But, in the court of public opinion, the boycott is inextricably linked with Lewis, and by extension his comments., That’s not a helpful association for representatives of the state’s more purple districts, including Bill Keating’s Cape Cod, Seth Moulton’s North Shore, and Niki Tsongas’s Merrimack Valley. It’s also potential baggage for anyone contemplating a future state-wide campaign, as Joe Kennedy III may have in his future plans., All that political calculation aside, however, the other issue is a genuine belief that many public officials hold in the importance of the symbolic trappings of the great American experiment in democratic self-governance., After all, we are learning through Trump’s counter-example that many of our system’s greatest protections lie in norms—most notably the peaceful transfer of power, but also financial conflict-of-interest disclosure and access of press coverage—that exist by more by mutual consent than enforcable law., It might seem corny, or perhaps sheep-like, but many elected officials take seriously the symbols and rituals of the American political system—especially veteran pols, including Capuano, Stephen Lynch, Jim McGovern, and Richie Neal., Bear in mind that those four all had to stand there, as Nancy Pelosi handed the Speaker’s gavel, and all the power it represents, to their political enemy John Boehner in January 2011. And as they watched, they could remember their Republican colleagues watching, four years earlier, as their party transferred that same gavel to Pelosi., So, I’m not surprised that the Massachusetts delegation has felt a strong obligation to honor the peaceful transfer of power, despite their concerns with the man receiving that power., But, I’m also not shocked that after a week hearing from constituents in liberal Somerville during the House recess, Capuano decided to join the boycott anyway.]"
1518,[Environmental Advocates Unimpressed By EPA Nominee In Confirmation Hearing],"[Environmental advocates and at least one U.S. Senator from Massachusetts were unimpressed with testimony Wednesday by Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt at his confirmation hearing for the top job at the Environmental Protection Agency., Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts asked Pruitt if he agrees with the man who nominated him climate change., “Do you agree that global warming is a hoax?” Markey asked., “I do not, Senator,” Pruitt replied., Markey followed up, asking him if Trump is wrong, and Pruitt just repeated that he didn’t believe climate change is a hoax.,  “OK, that’s important for the president to hear,” Markey added., “I suppose it’s a good thing that he at least acknowledges that climate change is happening,” said Ben Hellerstein, state director for Environment Massachusetts. “Although I don’t know how much that is worth if he’s not willing to do anything about it. The bottom line is that we need to move even more quickly than we have been towards clean energy. And Scott Pruitt is pledging to stand in the way.”, George Bachrach, the president of the Environmental League of Massachusetts, said Pruitt’s comments betray his professional past., “I mean he is a climate denier,” Bachrach said. “He is someone who has fought the EPA tooth and nail on behalf of the big oil, big gas industry that he has represented in Oklahoma. He can’t walk away from that, and he’s just being disingenuous.”, During the hearing, Senator Markey tried to get Pruitt to pledge to recuse himself from eight ongoing lawsuits that he filed against the EPA as Oklahoma’s Attorney General. Markey said not recusing himself would give the impression of the fox not just guarding the hen house, but destroying it., “Because you haven’t distanced yourself from the actual litigation that you have initiated on most of the key issues that you are now going to have responsible for protecting, in terms of the public health of the entire country,” Markey said., “And Senator,” Pruitt responded, “I can say to you unequivocally I will recuse as directed by EPA ethics counsel.”, Greg Cunningham of the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation says Pruitt’s statement that he’ll wait for the input of EPA lawyers, rather than recusing himself at the outset, is troubling., “He’s now proposing to represent the agency and would continue to be involved in cases in which he is claiming wrongful action by the EPA,” Cunningham said. “And those cases really get at some of the fundamental actions and authorities of the agency.”, Those include the authority of the EPA to limit the toxic emissions from power plants, and the finding that carbon emissions should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

1526,[What Ever Happened To Post-Racial America?],"[On election night a couple months ago, many voters were calling it a night after the suspense slowly dissipated, state after crucial state going to Donald Trump., Twitter seemed to quiet down and spectators at Hillary Clinton’s victory party started to leave. The mood darkened., Meanwhile, on CNN, commentator Van Jones put aside his facts and figures for a personal moment., “This was a whitelash against a changing country,"" he said. ""It was whitelash against a black president in part. And that's the part where the pain comes."", Since that night, details have emerged about how the 2016 election was tied to race., But Cornell Belcher, a pollster and political strategist, has been interested in race’s impact on elections for years., “I started doing research around race, and how race would impact the elections starting actually in 2007,” he said during an appearance on WGBH’s Boston Public Radio. “And I kept it going.”, Belcher explained how the election of Barack Obama led to an unexpected reaction from white voters., “[It] was sort of the wolf at the door for Americans who were afraid of a changing, more diverse America,” he said., That fear, according to Belcher, was a catalyst for the support for Donald Trump., He said Obama's victory, won without majority support from whites (he received only 38% of the white vote), led to an increase in “racial aversion.”, Belcher described this concept as “negative attitudes and views about other groups""-- not the same as racism, he said., “Racism is such a hot word... I don’t want to call people racist and have that negative back and forth because in the end, demographics are destiny,” he said. “We’re not going to become a whiter nation, so we have to understand our differences, and move forward with our differences.”, Belcher explained that he, like many others, had been optimistic for a post-racial America after the election of Obama, but that hope never became reality., “What my research over the last eight years shows is that it wasn’t a lessening of racial aversion, it was actually an increase of racial aversion, and particularly really spiking at the right moment creating the perfect storm for Donald Trump,” he said., Belcher said that when white voters feel “uncertain or threatened,” they turn inward and become more conservative., 58 percent of white voters cast their ballots for Trump in 2016, while the majorities of every other racial voter category went for Clinton., “When people say they want to take back their country, they really do think they're losing their country,” Belcher said., Cornell Belcher is a pollster, political strategist and president of Brilliant Corners Research &amp; Strategies.

1527,[Mass. Scored A Victory In Its Exxon Lawsuit. What's Next?],"[Bob Seay, host of WGBH's Morning Edition, interviewed WGBH News legal analyst and Northeastern University law professor Daniel Medwed about Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey's recent victory against ExxonMobil in an ongoing lawsuit against the company. Below is a lightly edited transcript of their conversation, My understanding is the attorney general is suing ExxonMobil for failing to provide accurate information about the effects of its products on climate change.  What is the basis of the suit, and why might Massachusetts have jurisdiction?, The theory is that ExxonMobil violated the Massachusetts consumer protection statute for decades by neglecting to disclose information about the impact of many of its energy products on the climate — information that would have altered consumers spending preferences and basically consisted of fraud. Because ExxonMobil has long conducted business in Massachusetts, the attorney general claimed that the Commonwealth and its residents were substantially affected by Exxon’s misbehavior., How unusual is this type of case — for a state attorney general to go after a large multinational corporation that lacks any direct ties to the states and is headquartered elsewhere?, This litigation reminds of me the tactics used several years ago by some state attorneys general to go after “Big Tobacco.” The main difference, of course, is that with the tobacco litigation one could show a direct effect between the behavior — misleading information — and the effect on the consumer — purchasing the goods and contracting lung cancer. Here, the effect is more attenuated — that consumers purchased ExxonMobil products when they might not have otherwise done so, and that contributed to climate problems which, in turn, has jeopardized all of us., Specifically, what happened last week to alter the trajectory of the case?, Several major developments occurred at the state trial court. First, the Superior Court judge rejected Exxon’s attempt to remove the case to federal court in Texas. Second, and more notably, the court ordered Exxon to turn over 40 years of documents related to what it knew and did not know about the effects of its products on climate change. This, of course, is critical to the Commonwealth’s case — it’s very much unclear what Exxon knew and at what time it knew it. These documents will go a long way in filling in the frankly sizable gaps in the attorney general’s case, What should we expect in terms of next steps in the case?, ExxonMobil has announced that it is reviewing the decision to determine its course of action, but I anticipate two moves., First, Exxon will probably appeal this decision to the Massachusetts appellate courts. That is unlikely to produce a different outcome because appellate courts often defer to trial courts when it comes to preliminary determinations like this. Still, it would prolong the case — and delay is often the name of the game for large, deep-pocketed civil defendants., Second, even if ExxonMobil is eventually compelled to turn over these documents, I suspect there were will be epeated skirmishes about which documents are and are not relevant, which portions should be redacted or excised somehow because they contain sensitive information, and so on. So we’re far from done here, Bob., Now Exxon has also claimed that Healey is suing for political reasons and should be removed from the case. Is that claim likely to be a factor?, I doubt it — the trial court judge also denied Exxon’s request to formally remove Maura Healey from the case. As to whether this case is politically motivated, I very much doubt it — our attorney general is one of the most principled lawyers in the public realm. But sure, few decisions like this are entirely divorced from politics; there is the old adage that “A.G.” stands for ""almost governor."", Marilyn Schairer is a reporter and producer for WGBH News.]"
1528,"[Once A Campaign Talking Point, Walsh Ethics Committee Quietly Ceases Activity]","[At his 2014 inauguration, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh delivered a speech outlining his goals and promises to the city, among them a pledge to create a special committee to bring a new standard of transparency to City Hall., That spring, Walsh made good on his promise. In a press release, the mayor announced the creation of a city “Ethics Committee” to review and revise existing policies around financial disclosure and other ethics issues and establish “an even stronger culture of ethical behavior and transparency in city government.”, In the nearly three years since, the committee has released no public reports, public recommendations, public advisory opinions, or public findings that WGBH News was able to obtain (city officials say it was not asked to issue written reports). It has not met publicly, has no web site, and is not listed among the city’s myriad other boards, commissions, or committees. , And, city officials confirmed to WGBH News last week, the committee has ceased meeting, at least for now — with little of the fanfare with which it was created., One of the committee’s four original members says that he was unaware it was meeting in the first place.  , “I attended an introductory meeting, and at the meeting we did discuss some areas that the [committee] intended to look at,” said Peter Sturges, one of Walsh’s four appointees to the committee. Sturges is board chair of Common Cause Massachusetts, which advocates for government transparency., But after that, Sturges said, “There was no meeting that I was aware of.”, Sturges resigned from the committee in 2016., With issues of financial disclosure, transparency and ethics in government coming to the fore of national politics, Walsh has not been immune from calls to push for greater transparency in Boston government — last week, the Boston Globe reported on Walsh’s still unachieved goal of requiring lobbyists of city government to disclose their lobbying activities. , It was after questions by The Boston Herald and WGBH News that Walsh's charitable foundation assented to disclose many, though not all, donors to a 2015 fundraiser (a list which included developers and other companies with city business) and pledged to release all donors in the future., The establishment of an ethics committee was a talking point for Walsh on the 2013 campaign trail, at his inauguration, and in office. But it seems to have fallen largely out of public view since then., Nicole Caravella, a spokesperson for Walsh, emphasized in emails to WGBH News that the committee did meet, “either by phone or in person,” at least four times since 2014, and “conducted dozens of hours of work and exchanged many phone calls” over that period — though the office did not provide exact dates. As a purely advisory body, the committee did not maintain meeting minutes or agendas, according to Caravella. , The Mayor’s Press Office did not offer an explanation as to why committee member Sturges would recall being invited to no such meetings, or whether he was indeed made aware of them; but the office did confirm that Sturges had resigned from the committee., The Mayor’s Office did not offer, as requested by WGBH News, any formal or informal memos, recommendations, or other documentation that might have been produced by the committee, noting that it was not tasked with producing such written reports. , Sturges acknowledged that the committee may have gotten together after its initial meeting, but said that if it did he was not aware of those meetings., Walsh spokesperson Caravella said that the committee’s work over the past few years involved various reforms to city disclosure policies, including:, Working with the city’s law department to streamline the city’s Statement of Financial Interest forms., Implementing, with the help of the city’s Department of Innovation and Technology, at virtually no extra cost to taxpayers, an online filing system for the disclosures, which were previously filed in hard copy. (They will remain unavailable online to the public but can be obtained via records request.), Creating a new ethics education and training curriculum for city employees that has since been implemented.  , In many other big cities — Philadelphia, New York, and, in a smaller city closer to home, Somerville — ethics commissions serve as independent watchdog agencies with clear investigatory and enforcement powers., Walsh never promised an ethics body along those lines. And the few specific goals he did outline were indeed among those tasks the Mayor’s Office says the committee took up., But the committee’s stated scope of reviewing “any relevant changes to the City’s Ethics Policy” appears to have ended there., The Mayor’s Office confirmed that that the committee is no longer meeting, “now that the initial goals of the committee have been achieved,” spokesperson Caravella said in an email., Two other committee members, committee chair and city Corporation Counsel Eugene O’Flaherty and University of Massachusetts-Boston Chancellor Keith Motley, did not directly return calls for comment.  , Elissa Flynn-Poppey, a fourth member of the committee who also works as Walsh’s personal attorney, serves as president of his charitable foundation, and does financial work for his mayoral committee, directed inquiries to the Mayor’s Press Office., Asked whether Walsh plans to reconvene, reconstitute or replace the now-dormant ethics committee, spokesperson Caravella wrote: “The Walsh Administration will continue to uphold only the highest ethical standards and prioritize efforts to improve transparency.”, Isaiah Thompson is a reporter WGBH News.]"

Where we need to be careful is to make clear that we’re asking questions for the public,” he said. “We’re not important. What we do is important.”, John King is CNN’s Chief political correspondent.

1537,[Ralph Nader: 'Even Al Gore Knows I Didn't Cost Him The Election'],"[In 1965, Ralph Nader came to prominence by way of his best-selling book ""Unsafe At Any Speed,"" a seminal work which shook up the auto industry and led to a whole host of new safety requirements designed to protect the lives of drivers all across the country. (If you've ever worn a seatbelt, for example, you have Ralph Nader to thank.), Today, 50 years on, his latest book shakes up the animal kingdom by giving voice to alligators, flamingos, earthworms and more. It’s a work of fiction entitled ""Animal Envy: A Fable""—and it even has a blurb from Patti Smith, who calls it a clarion call.  Of course, Nader is not just an author, he’s a leading consumer advocate and Green Party presidential candidate, and he joined Jim Braude and Margery Eagan live at NPR's headquarters in Washington, D.C. to discuss all that and more., MARGERY EAGAN: I wonder, Ralph Nader, you've been watching the political scene for a while and were a candidate yourself. Anything you've learned about the United States of America on November 8th that surprised you that you didn't know?, RALPH NADER: When you only have 2 choices and they’re Trump and Clinton, you get a lot of impulsive behavior by voters who are fed up with government turning their backs on the people and selling out to wealthy donors and not solving problems. So they attached that syndrome to Hillary Clinton, yesterday’s candidate. And enough of them for the electoral college—she won the popular vote—enough of them in the electoral college voted for Trump simply because they didn’t like her and they didn’t like the establishment she represented. If we had a multiparty system, I think we would have had a greater mix of agendas and redirections to give people more choice., EAGAN: Do you think the Democrats messed up by not going with Bernie sanders?, NADER: Well, I happen to think Bernie Sanders probably would have defeated Trump. He was scandal free, compared to Trump’s baggage.  He could talk to white male workers in the Midwest which is, of course, a critical pivot in the election that threw it to Trump. And he’s got a record to be proud of. You could say, 'well, he’s a Democratic Socialist and that’s a negative,' but he came from the most rock-ribbed Republican state in the Northeast, Vermont, and he they kept reelecting him with larger majorities. I think he would have been a better choice. I think actually a lot of people could have defeated Trump: Elizabeth Warren, senator from Massachusetts, Vice President Biden is probably kicking himself why he dropped out., JIM BRAUDE: When the 'unfavorables' for both candidates were in the low 60s, any sane person was saying if there was ever a year for a third party candidate, it was this one. Both performed abysmally. Is that because people can’t accept the third party thing, or because [Gary Johnson and Jill Stein] were abysmal candidate?, NADER: Ever since they’re in middle school, they’re taught only one of the two major party candidates can ever win. So they start out saying ‘these people can’t win.’ Because Stein and Johnson didn’t have big money, they didn’t give them the benefit of the doubt. Whereas if Bloomberg—the former mayor of New York City—came in, it would have been an instant 3-way race, instant polling and instant recognition by the press. The press has some responsibility in marginalizing third party candidates—I speak from considerable experience., BRAUDE: Speaking of your experience, we’re proud to say I believe this is the first interview you’ve done in 16 years where we’re not going to ask you if you cost Al Gore the 2000 election. You want to thank us for that?, NADER: I do. Even Al Gore knows I didn’t cost him the election. He has other sine qua nons that he knows about., To hear more from Ralph Nader, tune in to Boston Public Radio above.

1538,"[Cost Control: With MassHealth Rolls Surging, Baker Plans Employer Assessment]","[Companies that do not offer their employees health insurance would pay a $2,000 annual assessment per full-time worker to the state under a plan Gov. Charlie Baker plans to offer later this month to blunt the impact of escalating, enrollment-driven costs in the state's Medicaid program, the State House News Service has learned., The proposal — the bulk of which is expected to be filed within the governor's budget due on Jan. 25 — would also impose growth caps on the rates health providers can charge for medical services in an effort to control the cost of care in the commercial market and make it more affordable for employers., Both ideas come as the state is grappling with questions about how to control growth in health care costs in the public and private markets and as enrollment in MassHealth has reached an all-time high — a projected 1.93 million people in fiscal 2017 — putting unsustainable pressure on state finances., Provider price caps in the commercial market are also part of the administration's plans, according to officials, as a cost control measure designed to make insurance plans more affordable for employers and employees and to discourage avoidable enrollment in MassHealth., The employer assessment, which would bring an estimated $300 million into state coffers, represents a revival of the so-called fair share contribution plan that was a linchpin of the 2006 universal health care law in Massachusetts before it was repealed to make way for the federal Affordable Care Act., The details of Baker's multi-part plan to address the costs that come with surging enrollment in MassHealth despite low unemployment, population growth, and the highest rate of insured residents in the country were laid out in an internal policy planning document obtained by the State House News Service. The administration subsequently confirmed the contents of the 15-page document., The state employer mandate was repealed in 2013 as lawmakers and former Gov. Deval Patrick worked to bring Massachusetts into compliance with the Affordable Care Act, and a parallel federal mandate that would have fined employers with over 50 employees that did not offer insurance has never gone into effect., The expansion of insurance subsidies under the ACA has also led to an increase in full-time workers choosing MassHealth over employer-sponsored coverage., ""The unintended consequences of Massachusetts' compliance with the Affordable Care Act are forcing taxpayers to cover the cost of a growing number of employed individuals' healthcare as these workers increasingly move to the publicly subsidized healthcare system. To protect taxpayers from this growing problem, the administration is proposing reforms aimed at maintaining MassHealth's sustainability, addressing the affordability of health care, and increasing the state's flexibility in ACA implementation, while also reducing administrative burdens on employers, and reintroducing an employer contribution requirement for employers with over 10 employees,"" Tim Buckley, senior advisor to Baker, said in a statement to the News Service., MassHealth, the state's Medicaid program providing subsidized health care coverage to low-income residents, is projected to grow by $1.25 billion in fiscal 2018 with a net increase of $563 million for the state without reforms, according to the documents. The Baker administration attributes $600 million in increased costs to enrollment growth., Baker, in a letter to Congress last week, explained that since 2012 the number of residents insured through commercial coverage has declined 7 percent, while MassHealth enrollment has increased at the same rate., The trend, according to officials, can be explained in part by expanded eligibility under the ACA and the absence of penalties on companies that don't offer insurance that has led to employees either choosing MassHealth over employer-sponsored plans or not being offered coverage through their workplace at all., Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders and Administration and Finance Secretary Kristen Lepore said the combined effort to control costs for employers, impose a new assessment, improve internal controls and seek greater flexibility from the federal government would hold the net growth in MassHealth expenses after federal reimbursement to roughly 2 percent in the coming fiscal year., The package of insurance market reforms would also impose a moratorium on new coverage mandates and the elimination of vision and non-emergency transportation benefits - excluding mental health and substance abuse disorders - for members of MassHealth CarePlus program. CarePlus is a program covering the population that became newly eligible for subsidized insurance under Obamacare., The administration had considered eliminating dental coverage within CarePlus, according to the document, but Sudders and Lepore said the final benefit changes would not impact dental coverage., Before the ACA took effect, Massachusetts employers were required to offer health coverage to full-time workers and any employer with 11 or more workers that failed to comply had to pay a $295 fee per worker. Employees offered qualifying health coverage through their jobs were also made ineligible for MassHealth, but that restriction changed under the ACA allowing full-time workers to choose MassHealth over employer-sponsored coverage., Baker's plan would impose a $2,000 fee for all full-time workers - defined as someone who works 35 hours or more - for the same sized businesses, offsetting about half the average cost of insuring someone through Medicaid. The fines would apply to business that don't cover at least 80 percent of their workers and share at least 60 percent of the premium cost with employees., The plan differs from the Affordable Care Act that called for fines to be assessed on companies with more than 50 employees. The federal employer mandate, however, was delayed several times and though it is due to take effect in 2017, according to the IRS, Congress's interest in repealing the ACA and the lack of progress toward implementing the fees have led to doubts about its future, Sudders and Lepore said., Both Cabinet officials said the administration would not ""double assess"" companies if the ACA fines remained in place and took effect, and another senior administration official said the governor could be willing to unwind the assessments if the federal government gives Massachusetts greater flexibility to control MassHealth., ""By implementing these reforms, taxpayers would no longer be forced to pick up the cost of more and more employed individuals' healthcare and the Commonwealth would bring back key elements of the original, bipartisan Massachusetts health law passed years ago,"" Buckley said., To make insurance more affordable for companies, Baker intends to seek a waiver from what the administration sees as onerous reporting requirements under the ACA employer mandate and impose provider price caps on the delivery of health care services., The administration may also seek waivers from ACA-mandated rating factors and other provisions depending on what reforms the Republican-led Congress adopts., The price cap policy proposal, which is still being developed, would exclude primary care and behavioral health, Sudders said. The cap levels would most likely be set by the Division of Insurance (DOI) through regulations, and provider rates would have to be approved by DOI., The administration also wants to eliminate facility fees charged by providers for satellite clinics and outpatient care, make it easier for small businesses to shop through the Connector and empower the Center for Health Information and Analysis to post rates for common procedures on its website for easy comparison by consumers., College students not covered by their parents' insurance would also be required to join the plan offered through their university rather than enroll in MassHealth, and the state would pay the difference., The idea of price caps is one that has come up in the work of a special commission led by Rep. Jeffrey Sanchez and Sen. Jamie Welch on cost containment. House Majority Leader Ron Mariano, a member of the provider price variation commission, told the News Service in November that he sensed little support for a return to rate setting, but left the door open to caps., ""The use of rate caps as it applies to a percentage of Medicaid may be something you could look at as a short-term solution to close the gap so there is an opportunity to maybe take a look at that and see if it fits what we're trying to do,"" Mariano said., Most of the policy changes will be filed by Baker as outside sections to his fiscal 2018 budget proposal, which must then be vetted by House and Senate lawmakers over the coming months, according to a senior administration official, who said there may also be standalone bills related to the reforms.]"
1539,[Seeing Is Believing: Using Multimedia To Tell The Climate Change Story],"[On Nov. 16, as Boston’s coast reached its highest tide of the year at around 12.5 feet, graduate student Emily Duwan stood ready at downtown Boston’s Long Wharf with her tripod and GigaPan robotic camera., As Long Wharf locals and visitors waded through the waters of the so-called “King Tide,” the GigaPan captured more than 400 images to create a 360-degree view of the waterfront. Duwan, a student in Brian Helmuth’s lab at Northeastern University’s Marine Science Center, is completing a thesis project to test the efficacy of these types of “virtual tours” in classrooms, to see if the use of virtual reality in education leads to enhanced excitement and interest in climate change., “The increase in technology has really changed how we can communicate science,” Duwan said. “Anyone that’s in the middle of the country that hasn’t even seen an ocean before can now be immersed in that environment with new technology.”, Duwan is part of a growing movement to develop effective tools to communicate the dangers of global climate change to the public. According to a March 2016 study from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, nearly 30 percent of Americans remain disengaged, doubtful, or dismissive of future climate impacts. The severity of climate projections has increased over time, but the trend of skepticism has persisted. To combat that, journalists are exploring new and creative ways to communicate climate change., Matthew Nisbet, an associate professor of communication studies at Northeastern University, has conducted extensive research on what is referred to as “the science of science communication.” He says one of the major challenges is communicating the realities of climate change without scaring people away., “One of the downsides of climate journalism is that there is a tendency to overemphasize the most catastrophic outcomes and the most dangerous risks,” Nisbet said. “It’s often important to focus on some of these more severe risks, but you also have to provide information about what … people can do to address that risk.”, It’s also important to give people a first-hand experience of what’s happening in the affected environments. Duwan’s virtual tours are one way to do that. She hopes the technology can be used to stimulate widespread action on climate change, especially when it comes to localized issues like sea level rise., “I’m hoping that people that don’t get the chance to come out here and see what the King Tides look like, they’ll have a better idea of what the waterfront will look like with future sea-level rise [after watching the virtual tour],” Duwan said., , Whether the King Tides, which occur annually as a result of the fluctuating lunar cycle, are seen virtually or in person, they’re a dramatic sight. Many observers simply saw the tide as a unique opportunity to wade through the water washing out of the Boston Harbor, but others found it a stark confrontation with the reality of climate change., Marc Silverman, who works for the Massachusetts Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), spent his lunch break observing the King Tides alongside colleague Paul Hunter, director of the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program., “I live about a quarter mile from the water,” Silverman said. “Soon, [my home] will be waterfront property.”, Hunter emphasized the need for greater visual representation of climate change impacts., “It’s got to be pictorial,” he said. “There’s a lot of projections that people can do in terms of showing what the impact will be on local businesses and properties.”, Julie Wormser, vice president for policy at Boston Harbor Now, a nonprofit organization dedicated to planning the future of Boston’s waterfront, says the King Tides are an important way to raise awareness of the changes that are occurring throughout the city, especially since climate change is not always top of mind for many Boston citizens., “There are things we need to be doing to engage people,” Wormser said. “You want to start from a place where people believe it.”, She says that helping the public understand Boston’s future is all about the intersection between “really good science, hope, and beauty.”, During the first King Tide in October, Boston Harbor Now invited visitors to share photos of their experience on social media, then compiled those photos at a website called MyCoast. It’s a small step, but will hopefully make a difference in communicating how Boston will be affected by sea level rise in the future., “We’re trying to get people to think creatively,” Wormser said. “We’re trying to say, ‘Here are things you can do that are people scale.’”, Though there was no social media push for the King Tide in November, that didn’t stop observers from taking time out of their workday to see the tides and “engaging in ‘whoa,’” as Wormser describes it., “It’s a pretty unique experience,” said David Dudek, information technology specialist for Jobs for the Future. “How often do you get to step in the Boston Harbor without leaving the ground?”, Silverman says the tides are indicative of greater changes to come. “I think the past year has proven that the weather patterns in this country and the whole world are changing drastically, and people haven’t seen the worst yet,” he said., Successful climate change communication involves the intersection of a number of people and groups, including citizen journalists who post photos on social networking sites. Still, it starts with the media., “We rely on journalists as professional news-gatherers to use their training and experience to tell us what’s important and to tell us what are the pressing problems that we face,” Nisbet said., Danielle Fino, manager of marketing and digital communications at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), says that’s become an even greater challenge as the ways people receive their news are increasingly divided., “There’s a lot of content out there about climate change,” Fino said. “On social media, we’re being channeled and siloed even more. We’re not even seeing the other information.”, As part of the WHOI communications team, Fino works to develop strategies to share up-and-coming marine science research while also increasing ocean awareness and literacy. She says photo and video demonstrations are often more effective than text within the “barrage of content” that permeates the web today., “Visuals are so key because that’s the easiest way for people to notice something, especially if it’s emotional,” she said. “People will relate and engage with something that they have an emotional connection with,” and then hopefully will promote it on their own social media site., Fino says that awareness and appreciation for the ocean have increased, but that promotion of content is now just as important as the quality of the content itself., “There’s a greater awareness of the ocean and the threats it faces than ever before,” she said. The question is, “How do you make sea level rise enough of a part of somebody’s interests that they actually want to share content about it and tell other people about it?”, It’s an enormous challenge that will only increase for the next generation of communicators. Passionate young people like Duwan hold the key to telling the story of climate change in a way that makes sense for people, hopefully leading to future climate action., “If we’re able to see what’s going to be impacted now, we can kind of prepare for that,” Duwan said. “Hopefully with the use of new technology, we can have a broader impact and reach more people about different environmental problems.”, This multimedia story was produced as part of WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy's class in Digital Storytelling and Social Media at Northeastern University.]"
1540,[Mass. Coalition Fights To Promote The Rights Of Immigrants And Refugees],"[Joel Rivera grew up in Pasadena, Texas, as the son of Mexican immigrants. Rivera went to schools with large Hispanic populations for an extensive period of his life, keeping him grounded in his background. Growing up, he has been grateful for his two cultures but has occasionally struggled with balancing both., “At the end of the day, I’m rooted in a Mexican culture and language and food, things like that, and traditions, as well as American ones,” Rivera said. “I’m both, and it feels like it’s a lot of work, but I think I’m fortunate.”, But not everyone is as fortunate as Rivera. In efforts to change that, he works as a field organizer for the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA), where he works to protect and promote the rights and integration of refugees and immigrants. With the changing political climate and ongoing uncertainty of refugee and immigration policy, it’s important now more than ever to protect those who cannot protect themselves.  , MIRA is an institution that works with more than 130 organizations that are service providers for immigrants and refugees. It also works with legislators at the Statehouse to help draft pro-refugee and pro-immigrant legislation, both at the state and federal levels. Additionally, it has a citizenship team that hosts clinics in local communities with high immigrant populations. These clinics aim to help immigrants through the citizenship process. They have a few lawyers in the office that deal with legal matters., According to the American Immigration Council, one in six Massachusetts residents are immigrants. More than half of the immigrants in Massachusetts are naturalized citizens, and are thus eligible to vote. New Americans, a term that refers to immigrants and their children, make up 15.5 percent of the registered voters in the state., Though life at a nonprofit is busy and engaging, everyone at MIRA is enthusiastic about what they do., “I love everyone that I work with and they’re all very passionate,” Rivera said. “They have unique roles, and they’re good at what they do, and I think we’re all fighting the good fight.”, , MIRA started in 1987 and is widely involved at the national level, as it is one of the first statewide coalitions to advocate on behalf of refugees and immigrants. MIRA organizers look to work with legislators who are sympathetic toward immigrants and put pressure on those that aren’t. Though Massachusetts itself is considered a generally welcoming state towards refugees and immigrants, there is a lot of work that needs to be done at the national level., “We have a lot of good support for immigrants,” said Sue Parsons, development coordinator at MIRA. “For instance, a lot of support for English language programs, for citizenship programs that help people not simply be legal residents but to actually gain their us citizenship, be able to vote. However, overall, because we have such a lack of good immigration policy nationally at the federal level, that impacts all of us at the state.”, Aside from the central advocacy portion of MIRA, there is the part that looks at what programs and policies will help immigrants integrate through social, civic, and economic means. This might include language classes, small business development initiatives ,or programs that help place working immigrant families with better child care. This is mainly handled through the New Americans Integration Institute, which was launched as a part of MIRA in 2011., “It’s more focused in a way on economic development and education than MIRA’s traditional organizing and advocacy focus,” said Jeff Gross, director of the Institute., With the new presidential administration looming, the people at MIRA must brace themselves for the policy impacts that are to come and reassess how they can best serve the immigrant and refugee community. In the wake of the election, the organization has made calls to members to reassure them that they will keep fighting. The future of programs like Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) seem unsteady, and with that comes a lot of anxiety from the immigrant community., “The future is always where we go from here. We want to have longer term strategies, but in our field, we have to be very captive to history,” Gross said. “I think probably one thing we’ll end up doing is, probably, as we’ve been doing for the last several years is focus more on state because there’s gonna be so little progress to be made at the national level.”, As the child of immigrants, Rivera’s background fits well with his work and what he hopes to accomplish in the future., “My line of work, effectively, is like a gift, and something that I cherish,” Rivera said. “I think education has always been, like, very important, and using what I have naturally developed to help others has always been something that’s very central at home, something that’s been pushed as just what we’re about.”, This multimedia story was produced as part of WGBH News contributor Dan Kennedy's class in Digital Storytelling and Social Media at Northeastern University.]"

In fact, his papers are housed at the university to this day.  After King was assassinated in 1968, BU instituted a program in his name that admitted minority students to the university.,  The MLK commemoration at BU has evolved into a celebration concert that includes music, poetry and performances. Now in it's 45th year, today's concert theme is “Hope, Despair, and the Blues.""  It features Dorchester native and a composer who worked with Duke Ellington, Randall Keith Horton.,  Horton told me why he's always had an affinity for Ellington's three Sacred Concerts.  “The choral music that is drawn from the Bible is definitely what distinguishes what is known Ellington… known by the populace… you know by the public… and the sacred music has gorgeous choral music in it,” says Horton., WGBH’s Eric Jackson, host of the jazz program, “Eric In The Evening,” was a recipient of BU’s MLK scholarship and attended the university's first commemoration after King's death. And he says that Ellington and King crossed paths at least once.,  “ I know that there is at least one picture of them meeting together. That may be the only time they met,” says Jackson., But what Ellington and King had in common was a philosophy of love, tolerance, and healing. While King spread his message through impassioned speeches and civil disobedience during the tumultuous years of the Civil Rights Movement, Jackson says Ellington did so through his music.,  “ Ellington, as long as I can think back in his career, always made a point of shining a positive light on African-American culture… even in the titles of the songs that he would make,"" says Jackson., Ellington himself considered his sacred music concerts the most important music he ever composed. But Randall Keith Horton says not everyone embraced the jazz greats foray into the spiritual realm.,  “Folks in the religious community especially in the African-American community…. not all but there were some… who said that this man… who has been in nightclubs all his life …. doing music in no way edifies God… has no business…all of a sudden turning to religious or sacred music. So, he was rejected by a lot of the black churches,” according to Horton., Horton says Ellington was hurt by the backlash because he considered himself a man of deep faith.,  “The way Ellington got through all of the confusion and the madness that was in the jazz world was his faith. He had a firm faith but he wasn't able to express it because of the realities of his performance venues and the genre in which  he presented his music,"" says Horton., Horton hopes that by performing Ellington’s Sacred Music at Boston University Martin Luther King Jr. concert…it'll bring alive the shared experience of two men dedicated to breaking down barriers.  , To listen to the MLK Story click on the audio file above., To listen to extended interviews with WGBH ME host Bob Seay and Conductor Randall Keith Horton click on the audio. , To listen to extended interviews with WGBH ME host Bob Seay and WGBH Jazz host Eric Jackson click on the audio file. ,  ,  , Marilyn Schairer is a reporter and producer for WGBH News.]"
1543,[Author Rowan Jacobsen: Oysters Are The Jewel Of New England],"[For Bostonians who love oysters, there's no shortage of places to get these nectars of the sea., There are restaurants which have free oyster nights, and places like Row 34 and Island Creek Oyster Bar shuck more oysters per night than one can imagine. But New England isn't alone — oyster appreciation s at an all-time high across the country., Enter James Beard Award-winning author Rowan Jacobsen, who feelt writing one book about oysters wasn't enough. He's the author of ""Geography of Oysters,"" ""The Living Shore,"" and is now out with a beautiful book called ""The Essential Oyster"" — a salty appreciation of taste and temptation. Below is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation., Why did you feel there was a need for a third book about oysters?,  , , This is the end of my trilogy. I've definitely completed my always geology at this point. When I wrote that first book, it was nine years ago and it was kind of when that the whole oyster wave was just taking off. There was no information out there. So that first book, I really wrote [it] to be a useful tool so somebody could saunter up to a bar with confidence and know what they are ordering and know how to go about oyster eating. So much has changed in the country in the past few years. Oyster mania has taken off — and in regions of the country that had no oyster cultivation at all. There's now super energetic farming going on, so I can write the new book to capture the essence of oyster culture all around the country., Why do you think it's taken off so big? I mean, it's really everywhere., It's everywhere. I keep asking myself that. Like, why is this happening now? And I think it's because oysters are so real. As more and more of our world goes virtual, the thing that came straight out of the water unchanged that's on your plate, that's this whole creature with these rocky shallots, just so real — I think we're starting to value that. So they're kind of like the LPs of food, maybe., I like that. There's more information on oysters in the first 10 pages of this book, ""The Essential Oyster,"" than one person can imagine. But the main gist of the book and your words is to make us confident enough to walk into a raw bar and order with confidence and swallow with confidence., So what do you prefer — cooked or raw?, I’m a raw guy. I’m a raw guy. I used to actually be kind of a big jerk about it, and I've mellowed over the years. I do love certain oyster recipes. But nine out of 10 times, raw., Because you've got some great recipes in the book. There are over 38 pages of this book that are devoted to Massachusetts and Rhode Island oysters, and it's amazing how in close proximity some of these oyster farms are, yet how much they differ in both size and in flavor., Yeah, it's crazy. In the same bay, like Duxbury Bay, there's maybe a dozen people growing there. But you can tell them apart. I was actually with Skip Bennett of Island Creek Oysters the other night at Row 34 in Portsmouth, and we made him taste — blind — a few different oysters, all from Duxbury Bay. He nailed them all. It was amazing., He did?, He did. Every one., That's very impressive. Finally, Rohan, was it really a brave soul who ate the first oyster?, I think it was a really hungry soul, personally., To listen to the entire interview with Rowan Jacobsen and WGBH's Henry Santoro, click on the audio file above.]"

To just turn a doorknob.”, The pain continued, and Townsley went from doctor to doctor seeking help. After several years she got a diagnosis: juvenile rheumatoid arthritis., There is no cure. So, she embarked on a life of frequent treatments and medications, including injections into her spine and pelvis., , At age 28, things were going well, and her pain was under control. But in October 2012, she got a call from her doctor: three injections she’d received were contaminated., Townsley spent her 29th birthday, not at home in Alabama, but in Minnesota getting treatment at the renowned Mayo Clinic., “My face was flaking off,” says Townsley., The tainted injections had given her fungal meningitis, triggering a cascade of medical problems that, she says, continue to today., Townsley was not alone. Those tainted vials had made their way to 20 states, affecting more than 750 people and killing at least 64 of them., The FDA, the CDC and state health officials managed the crisis response. , ""We basically had to run it as a public health emergency,” says Joshua Sharfstein, who ran Maryland’s health department during the 2012 meningitis outbreak. “We just couldn't expect that people would go to the emergency department and get correctly diagnosed because it was so unusual."", An investigation traced the bad injections to the New England Compounding Center in Framingham, MA.

He’s accused of second-degree murder and racketeering. If found guilty, he faces up to life in prison., Although it has taken years to litigate the charges against Cadden, lawmakers and regulators didn’t wait. , The outbreak and the ensuing investigation “led Congress to pass a law significantly expanding the regulatory oversight of compounding pharmacies,"" says Sharfstein. , These pharmacies are much smaller than big drug manufacturers. But there are two broad types., Some produce on a tiny scale – often making drugs for just one patient at a time. These are used for patients who have a special need: perhaps for individuals with rare allergies or children who need a smaller-than-standard dose.  Others compounding pharmacies make medications in larger batches., Congress mandated that the FDA oversee the bigger compounding pharmacies. But states remain the primary regulators of the small-dose pharmacies., Massachusetts—where the outbreak originated—stepped up its regulations following the outbreak., As the rules changed, Stephen Bernardi changed his compounding pharmacy—Johnson Compounding and Wellness Center outside of Boston—to keep pace., Bernardi says he’s invested over a million dollars building his pharmacy’s labs, where pharmacists and technicians are subject to new procedures following the outbreak., ""Prior to that, you might have gotten inspected twice in 12 years. Now you’re getting inspected 12 times in one year,"" says Brenardi., The state has revamped regulations related to drug testing, cleanliness standards, and expiration dates. And this is not just the case in Massachusetts., In the years since the outbreak, 18 states have enacted laws related to compounding pharmacies, and other states are following suit. But experts say there’s still a lot of variation state by state. , Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"

1553,[Growing Pains in Massachusetts],"[Marijuana is legal in Massachusetts, but it will be at least another year and a half before retail shops are allowed to sell it.   It means – for now – the only way to get pot legally is with a medical marijuana card or by attempting something that’s becoming increasingly popular:  grow it at home., “It’s people in their sixties, 21 and up, anyone and everyone wants to do it,” said Charis Dunn, who works at Boston Gardener in Roxbury.   She says since the law legalizing marijuana went into effect in December it’s been a struggle to keep the shelves stocked with supplies for growing it.   “We have back orders for people.”, One customer, who did not want to be identified, told WGBH News he’s spent $800 dollars for a home grow operation that includes a tent, lights, fan and exhaust system.   He set it up in a spare bedroom inside his Boston apartment and pointed with pride at the six plants he’s grown from seed., “It’s a great little hobby.  I’ve enjoyed it every step of the way,” he said. The man did not want to reveal his identity because he’s worried the plants could make him a target for thieves.   He figures each one is worth about $200., “If this was taken from my home there’s nothing that makes it legal or illegal except the person that possesses it,” he said.  “When it grows fully, it will have a high value and that could be easily turned into a street value with a simple burglary.”, Concern about the black market is echoed by Nicholas Vita, the chief executive officer of Columbia Care which runs medical marijuana facilities in Massachusetts and six other states.    He says he’s seen sophisticated underground operations develop when home grown pot is legalized., “If you look at any market where there’s been an introduction of these programs,” said Vita, “you also see an increase in black market activity.”, He says home growers who flaunt the law can sell their product for less and don’t need to comply with the standards required for medical marijuana operations.    He says laws allowing residents to grow marijuana also make it difficult for police to trace its origin., “Law enforcement doesn’t really know how to distinguish and they aren’t able to distinguish between a black market product that’s imported from Mexico or Canada or somewhere else and something that’s grown in Massachusetts,” said Vita.  “There’s no trait, characteristic or bar coding that would allow them to actually go back to the primary source.”, Vita stops short of calling for more regulations on home grown pot.  He says he just wants a level playing field.  He compares the practice to home brew beer.  Most people, he says, will decide the store bought variety is better., Inside his Boston apartment the grower who does not want his name published is hopeful his marijuana plants will continue to thrive.  He says he was spending as much as $300 a week buying medical marijuana., “I’m growing it just for my own medical consumption,” he said.  “It’d be so much better to have it for free.”, Stephanie Leydon is a feature reporter for WGBH News.]"

It claims the encounters were secretly taped and the evidence being held over Trump’s head as blackmail., While Keating didn’t say he believed the report, the congressman talked about the “mind games” he experienced while visiting Russia., “They wanted to keep us in the rooms they had assigned because they were wired,” Keating said. “They knock during the night to sleep-deprive [visitors] for meetings. They have spies going around.”, Keating went on to say he wasn’t pleased with the way Donald Trump has responded to the press in the wake of the leak., “The attack on CNN, calling them fake news-- That’s disconcerting going forward, because one of the last defenses we have in our country is having a free press,” he said. “What makes our country different is the freedom of the press and the ability to criticize.”, Trump’s press conference yesterday carried a combative tone as the president-elect called out media outlets, including CNN, for carrying the story., BuzzFeed News has come under fire for publishing the report in full despite its allegations being unsubstantiated, while CNN declined to publish the specific claims because they could not be verified., Trump called BuzzFeed News “a failing pile of garbage” and CNN “fake news.”, Keating said he’s noticed during his trips abroad that the nation's legitimacy is hurting because of Trump’s behavior., “We’re trying to export this sense of democracy and freedom around the world, and when people are seeing what’s going on now here-- to say that it undercuts that message is an understatement,” said Keating., Congressman Bill Keating is a senior member on both the House Foreign Affairs and Homeland Security Committees.

Kennedy has long been a public champion of the idea that vaccines cause autism, a claim that has been roundly rejected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the National Academies of Sciences, and others, according to The Washington Post.  As the paper writes: ""The scientific consensus on vaccines and autism is thorough and solid: There is no evidence of a connection."", Arthur Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University's Langone Medical Center, said the continued promotion of such a link came exclusively from celebrities—not medical professionals., ""[Kennedy] has been running around touting autism links to vaccines forever. He continued to do it, and he's joined in this activity by celebrities that Hollywood doesn't seem to want to condemn the way they go after, say, Mel Gibson, like Rob Schneider, Jenny McCarthy, and Jim Carey,"" Caplan said., ""They keep saying vaccines are known to cause autism,"" he continued. ""In fact, this has been debunked."", The vaccine-autism link stems from a 1998 paper by British scientist Andrew Wakefield, which linked a mercury-containing vaccine additive called thimerosal to rising autism rates in children. The paper was later revealed to have fraudulent data, and numerous U.S. agencies investigated the claim and found there was no link between the additive and autism. However, public health officials and vaccine manufacturers agreed to reduce the amount of thimerosal in childhood vaccines. Since 2001 thimerosal has been eliminated entirely or reduced to trace amounts in all vaccines required for children under the age of six., ""We pulled the mercury out of vaccines...It didn't change the autism rates, which kept climbing,"" Caplan said., Caplan also pointed to the fact that medical advancements have allowed doctors to diagnose autism in children at much younger ages—at points before they would be exposed to any vaccines., ""You're starting to be able to diagnose autism at six or eight months in children. You don't get the [mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR)] vaccine until you're older. So that's pretty good evidence,"" Caplan continued., To hear more from medical ethicist Arthur Caplan, tune in to Boston Public Radio above., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

But the scattered cheers from the crowd of around 35 Obama die-hards could only occasionally puncture the overall sense of dread these deep blue voters feel about the next four years., ""It was bittersweet, but I think he did a good job drawing contrast between his vision and the incoming administration's vision,"" said Keith Chaney, who owns a small business in Lawrence., Chaney said Obama also did a good job in the speech by helping the audience prepare themselves for the Trump era., ""There weren't too many people here in the room that weren't a little bit apprehensive about the incoming administration,"" Chaney said., After outlining his accomplishments, much of Obama's speech focused on inspiring younger Americans to become more involved in civic institutions or to even run for office themselves.

There's two sides of the aisle... I think he did a real good job outlining some of the things he wanted to do and considering the opposition that was laid in front of him, I think he did a decent job,"" Chaney said., Patrick Long is an attorney from Dorchester and thought Obama would have been more successful if he had been tougher with Congress., ""So much of a nice guy.

There were a lot of executive orders, there were a lot of things coming top-down. But I do think it came from a well-meaning place,"" Gebru  said., Awet Teame said she personally benefitted from Obama's policies during the recession., ""I was one of the people who was laid off and I tried really hard to find a job and I kept trying and trying, so when he did the extensions, I actually needed the unemployment extension.

He described melting glaciers and spoke of rising sea levels and an increase in severe storms., “And unless we take the steps necessary to change the course that our planet is on, the impacts that we have already seen will pale in comparison to what we will witness in years to come,” he said., The question, he said, is whether the country can transition to clean energy sources in time: “We face resistance of a strange combination of doubters and people making a lot of money off today’s paradigm.”, While coal might seem like a cheaper option now, Kerry said, energy sources that contribute to climate change are far costlier in the long term.  President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to bring back coal jobs, has called climate change a hoax. And Trump’s pick to run the Environmental Protection Agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, has fought EPA regulations of greenhouse gases., Kerry said climate change shouldn’t be a partisan issue. “It’s an issue that all of us should care about, regardless of political affiliation,” he said., The outgoing secretary of state seemed hopeful the new administration will keep an open mind on the subject., “I’m not going to speculate about the policies that the president elect and his secretary of state will chose to pursue,"" he said. ""But I will tell you this: In the time I’ve spent in public life, one of the things I’ve learned is that some issues look a lot different when you’re actually in office, compared to when you’re on the campaign trail.”, Even if the Trump administration doesn’t take steps to reduce greenhouse gases, Kerry struck an optimistic tone as he looked forward., “Today, I am confident that the United States is going to meet all of the emissions targets we that have set, not because of future government action, but because of the market-based forces that are taking hold all over the world,"" he said. ""The energy curve is bending towards sustainability.”, In the U.S., Kerry said, more people are now employed in renewable energy than by either the petroleum or coal industries, while cities are taking crucial steps to reduce their climate impact. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who was in the audience for Kerry’s speech, said the new administration may cause Boston to intensify its efforts to reduce greenhouse gases., “The White House can only set policy. It’s carried out by cities and industry,"" Walsh said. ""And I think that whether or not the White House believes in it, as long as cities and towns and industry around America continue to move forward, that’s where the work is carried out anyway, regardless of what the policy is.”, In November, Walsh and 13 other mayors in the region pledged to eliminate their communities’ carbon footprint by 2050. , Craig produces sound­-rich features and breaking news coverage for WGBH News. ]"

The President even saying publicly if he had a son he would look like Trayvon. That statement impressed Jamie Mitchell,, “That took a lot for a president to come out and say that.”, People we spoke to wanted to see the president do more and were disappointed he couldn’t, Christine Bond believes he didn’t have support, “He had the support of congress and the senate and didn’t have all those people that met on inauguration night while we were celebrating him and all of them worked for the united states and the people of America his legacy could’ve been even more.”, But all appreciate what he accomplished., Tina Martin is reporter for WGBH News.]"

1575,[Murder Trial Begins For Framingham Pharmacist Linked To 2012 Meningitis Outbreak ],"[Courtroom 21 was packed. On the seventh floor of the Moakley federal courthouse, opening statements and testimony got underway in the murder and racketeering trial of former pharmacist Barry Cadden., Cadden was the head pharmacist and co-owner of a compounding pharmacy whose drugs, investigators say, caused a 2012 meningitis outbreak. The outbreak was traced back to steroid injections that were contaminated with mold. 750 people fell sick from the injections. 64 of them died., According to federal prosecutors, Cadden’s greed drove him to flout regulations. He oversaw a highly unsanitary pharmacy and asked his employees to use expired ingredients. Prosecutors say Cadden knew that medications from his pharmacy could harm or kill patients, yet he still shipped them to doctors around the country.,  “[Barry Cadden] prioritized profit over patients,” said prosecutor George Varghase., Defense attorneys painted a very different picture. Cadden was just one man in a company with about 60 employees. As soon as he realized things were amiss, he acted aggressively to right what was wrong and warn physicians about any problems. The tainted injections were an isolated situation – not something systematic, defense attorneys claimed.,  “Of course, mistakes were made. Every business makes mistakes,” said defense attorney Bruce Singal. “Cadden made mistakes. They weren’t criminal. They weren’t murder.”, Cadden faces 97 charges, including second-degree murder for the death of 25 patients. If found guilty, the maximum sentence is life in prison., The Long-Awaited Trial, The much-anticipated trial is expected to last several weeks and could extend even longer. It got off to a late start as two jurors were stuck on a commuter train experiencing signal delays. Once they arrived, federal prosecutor George Varghase made the first opening statement., He told the story of two people: Douglas Wingate of Roanoke, VA and Godwin Mitchell of Ocala, FL. Varghase described two men leading active lives when they received the contaminated steroid injections. It wasn’t long before they were both dead. Varghase went on to name all 25 individuals Cadden is accused of killing., He portrayed Cadden as a callous, greedy man who was intimately involved in every aspect of the New England Compounding Center (NECC), the compounding pharmacy at the center of the case., “NECC was his baby,” said Varghase. “Everything happened because of Barry. Barry Cadden was NECC.” He argued that Cadden oversaw everything at the compounding pharmacy from the sales pitch to the clean room procedures. And thus, the responsibility rests with Barry Cadden., Varghase described filthy conditions -- flies and mold in the cleanroom where drugs were made, mice in the building and oil seeping through the floor. And it didn’t stop with cleanliness. Prosecutors presented emails and documents in an effort prove that Cadden had authorized the use of expired ingredients, allowed improper drug testing and let employees fabricate prescriptions. , Varghase said Cadden relabeled expired drug ingredients to make them appear as if they were still usable. Varghase showed email exchanges between Cadden and the supervisory pharmacist, Glenn Chin, who is also charged with second-degree murder. In one email, dated January 9th of 2009, Cadden wrote to Chin about retinoic acid injections. He said to relabel expired ingredients to make them appear usable. “Just relabel the old stuff…it’s not worth the time to make a new lot,” the email read., When defense attorney Bruce Singal made his statement, he acknowledged that the outbreak and the deaths were a tragedy. “There is no monopoly on empathy in this court room,” Singal said. “Everyone in this courtroom with a beating heart understands how tragic this is.”, However, Singal insisted that “there’s no evidence” to hold Cadden responsible for what happened. He showed video of the cleanroom, explaining how the company went above and beyond what was required by law to make sure the environment was safe., Singal said that the contaminated vials were an “isolated, aberrational, extraordinarily out of the ordinary” event. He said the pharmacy had a long and reliable safety record, having sent out more than 850,000 uncontaminated vials., Further, he said that when Cadden found his employees and contractors were not acting properly, he responded quickly. “He’s not sitting back and ignoring it. He’s trying to do something about it, and very aggressively.” In response to evidence of employees keeping inaccurate cleaning logs, Singal said: “Barry is insisting they do it right, and the people in the cleaning room are trying to trick him., By the end of Monday’s session, the prosecution had called its first witness: Benjamin Park of the CDC. Tomorrow, the trial continues as both sides present further evidence about Barry Cadden’s role in the death of 25 patients.,  , Gabrielle Emanuel is a reporter for GBH News.]"
1576,[Meggie Noel And Kylie Webster-Cazeau Take Time To Reflect],"[Two Boston Latin students made headlines last year after releasing a YouTube video that exposed the school for mishandling complaints of racism., Now, those two students, Meggie Noel and Kylie Webster-Cazeau, have graduated BLS and are taking some time to look back on the movement they started there., “It’s been one crazy year,” said Noel on WGBH’s Boston Public Radio today., The two women explained that their journey began after reading racist things their classmates were writing on social media., “We realized that a lot of students, particularly in our grade, were saying ignorant things,” said Noel., Many of these comments were in reference to deaths of people of color at the hands of white police officers, including the fatal shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson., Webster-Cazeau said seeing the things her classmates wrote online made her question the culture of her school., “I wasn’t necessarily surprised that people had these thoughts, but I was surprised that people were okay with putting them out in public and putting them out on Twitter,” she said. “I was really afraid of, honestly, how I was going to focus in class, knowing this is how people really felt about students of color.”, Some students, including Noel, presented the offensive tweets to the headmaster, Lynne Mooney Teta. A year passed. No action was taken., Webster-Cazeau said she and other students were patient for a while, given the sensitivity of topics like race. But, their patience ran out., “It’s kind of hard to understand and really figure out what you need to do [as administrators], but it was still too long,” said Webster-Cazeau., One day, the two students recorded a video voicing their complaints that went viral. They said they were surprised by the speed with which it circulated., “When we first made the video, we had absolutely no idea what was going to happen,” said Noel. “We released it, and then everything happened and kind of blew up.”, The video was viewed 14,000 times the first day it was posted, according to the Boston Globe., What followed was the resignation of the headmaster of Boston Latin, an investigation by Boston Public Schools, and a citywide discussion about race initiated by Mayor Marty Walsh. , They caused the city to reconsider its identity as a beacon of progressive thought., For Noel and Webster-Cazeau, the conversation they started isn’t done, though their peers at BLS say things have improved., “I think our only regret is not doing it sooner,” said Noel., Meggie Noel and Kylie-Webster-Cazeau were named the Bostonians of the Year by the Boston Globe for bringing awareness to the racial climate at Boston Latin.

1581,[Shirley Leung: Millennium Partners' Story Looks Shady],"[Developers and Boston residents convened at a meeting Thursday night to discuss a shady controversy: the shadow that will be cast over the Boston Common by a building on the site of the Winthrop Square garage., The developers, Millennium Partners, say they simply overlooked the state’s laws meant to prevent shadows on the Common., But, not everyone buys that excuse., Shirley Leung, the business columnist for the Boston Globe, joined WGBH’s Boston Public Radio to explain her hunch about the development and talk about her column published Thursday., “I was not only suspicious of the developer,” Leung said. “City hall said, ‘We didn’t really know the magnitude of the shadow issue,’ and I feel like was being spun.”, She said it’s unlikely Millennium Partners and the city of Boston didn’t know about the shadow laws., Millennium knows that any building over 365 feet will cast a shadow, she said, but the developer still pushed forth proposals for 600- and 700-foot buildings., “They were very tall, so all of the other proposals would have violated the shadow law,” she said. “Why didn’t the city figure this out?”, Leung noted that money that’d be brought in by the development would benefit the city, which she said could motivate City Hall to side with developers., But, from her perspective, concerns about the public should come first., “It shouldn’t be about the money.

1582,[Boston Public Library Puts Its World-Class Collection Of Rare Shakespeare Works On Display],"[“To be, or not to be—that is the question.”, Those might be the most famous words in all of English literature. But are they the original words in ""Hamlet?"", That is also the question, and just one of the many things you’ll encounter at the exhibit “Shakespeare Unauthorized” at the Boston Public Library, which includes some of the earliest and rarest surviving copies of Shakespeare’s greatest works., Jay Moschella, the curator of the exhibit, joined Boston Public Radio to discuss the collection. , JIM BRAUDE: You have one of the largest Shakespeare collections anywhere. Why did I not know this?, JAY MOSCHELLA: We have a major, world-class Shakespeare collection. We have the first major Shakespeare collection in the United States. This is something that’s been with the BPL since 1873. It’s not a new development. It’s a worldwide center of scholarship…We purchased it from a very major collector who was in the circle of Andrew Jackson, a wealthy country gentleman who spent his whole life in the 19th century building a personal collection of Shakespeare, going around Europe scouring auction houses there. He put this whole thing together himself. It was his life’s work. He died in 1869 and through a complicated series of intrigues, the city put together the funding to buy it from his widow a few years later., BRAUDE: This is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, and the city also did something to commemorate the 300th year. How high-profile has Shakespeare and the stuff you have been when you've not been doing a major terrific show like this one here?, MOSCHELLA: It’s high-profile for scholars and people coming to use it. People from Boston don’t necessarily always know we have these collections. We’re not a museum, so we don’t have these things on exhibit all the time. They’re not the kinds of things you’d walk through and see. We provide a different kind of service. The visibility is not always the same., MARGERY EAGAN: Tell us about this ""First Folio"" that’s significant., MOSCHELLA: This is one of the more exciting things here. It’s one of the very few rare books that exists in popular culture, the ""First Folio,"" like the Gutenberg Bible. This was the first collected edition of Shakespeare's works. It was printed seven years after his death. Those facts don’t sound inherently exciting on their own, but what the ""First Folio"" was was essentially the first edition of half of Shakespeare's plays. It’s one book, you can see it in the gallery right now. It’s the first edition of ""Macbeth,"" for example. It’s the first edition of ""The Tempest"" and of ""Julius Caesar."" What goes beyond in importance is those 18 plays, it’s reasonable to assume, would have been lost if not printed in this particular book. Most of the plays from Shakespeare’s era no longer exist., EAGAN: What does it look like?, MOSCHELLA: It’s a printed book. If you see it, you’ll recognize it – it contains a very iconic portrait of Shakespeare right on the title page. It has a large engraving. It’s about the size of an encyclopedia. It’s a beautiful book to see. , BRAUDE: This was written after Shakespeare’s death, but you also have things that were contemporaneous., MOSCHELLA: We do. These kinds of books, the individual books of his plays printed during his lifetime, are tremendously rare. We have a significant collection of those and many of them are on display in the hall. For instance, you can see the first edition of ""A Midsummer Night’s Dream"" which is a tiny little book, one of eight copies that exist in the world. There are many things like that on display right now., BRAUDE: Do you have notes and things of his? Of Shakespeare himself?, MOSCHELLA: Would that we did! One of the interesting back stories about this is that, despite what you might think, Shakespeare—the most important writer in the English language—basically almost none of his handwriting exists. There are 14 words that are undisputedly in his hand, 12 of those are the name “William Shakespeare” written six different times. One of the biographical mysteries or challenges we explore in the exhibition is: how do you know what Shakespeare really wrote if his handwriting doesn’t survive?, To hear more from Jay Moschella, tune in to Boston Public Radio above.

1587,"[Take A Walk Inside The World Of Cyber Warfare, Right Here In Cambridge]","[While Donald Trump is casting doubt on the seriousness of cyber attacks, that's not the case for businesses that fear a security breach. IBM has created X-Force Command, a cyber range in Cambridge that simulates cyber attacks so people from all industries can detect a breach and respond diligently., The cyber range is the brainchild of Caleb Barlow, vice-president of threat intelligence at IBM Security., “The key thing we are trying to build here is the leadership skills to not only identify that you’re being attacked,” says Barlow, “but just as importantly, know how to respond to an attack when it occurs. This isn’t any different from practicing a fire drill.”, With that approach, the cyber range is not just for the IT department of a company to come in and train. Barlow says a cyber attack affects every level of a business or organization., “This is a very popular misconception—that this is just an IT problem. It goes all the way from IT to human resources to the board of directors to your customers and partners. You need to know how you’re going to respond and how those relationships are built ahead of time.”, Organized crime vs. nation states, The Department of Justice reports the number of ransomware attacks are on the rise, clocking in at 4,000 attacks daily. And these attacks are increasingly coming via phishing scams. A recent report out of IBM Security found that 40% of phishing attacks in 2016 had ransomware in it—a staggering increase over .6% in 2015., It’s relatively easy to track where an attack comes from, however, the use of proxy servers can elude security analysts of the true origin. Knowing the motive for an attack is even murkier but the reality is that 80% of cyber attacks come from organized crime. Nation states conducting cyber espionage have been dominating the headlines lately but they make up the minority of offenders, “We have to recognize that the underlying challenge that we have to deal with as a society is organized crime,” says Barlow., Several industry insiders say companies will often blame nation states to keep the Securities and Exchange Commission from launching an investigation. This further amplifies the idea of nation states playing a more prominent role in these attacks., Attack mode, IBM’s Global Security Executive Advisor, Diana Kelley, walks me through a malware attack that’s taken over “my company’s” network., “We’ve created an attack where a phishing email came,” says Kelley, “So an email that someone clicked had malware attached to it and the malware infected the system.”, This isn’t pretend—it’s real malicious software but it’s all contained within IBM Security’s cyber range., Kelley shows me the backend of the network, and the number of IP addresses going red is doubling, tripling. The malware is rapidly making its way through the network. Since I’m no security expert, I don’t know what it means—but now I know what it looks like. And Kelley says there’s value in that for company executives who can be generally clueless about these things., “Here you can be better at detecting because you can identify the activity. We have an attacker so you can see what it looks like. But also very importantly, being better at improving your response.”, I’m a CEO now, Part of the whole experience at IBM’s cyber range includes teaching a CEO how to deal with the public fallout of a breach. This involves sitting executives down in front of a TV camera in a fully operable TV studio IBM built for this purpose. Of course, Caleb Barlow delights in reversing roles and plants me in front of the green screen. I’m now the CEO of a company that’s dealing with a major breach. Stocks are in freefall. There’s a lot at stake., “You don’t know how your company is going to fare,” Barlow says, “But everyone out there is talking to reporters speculating on this breach. And you need to get in front of this problem and show leadership and that you’ve got in under control. Let’s see how you do.”, A breaking news segment begins, and I’m suddenly fielding questions from a very convincing actress playing a hostile CNBC-type host named Amy, asking me when I found out about the breach, the magnitude of it and she even asks me if I’ve been asked to resign. Amy is disgusted with all my answers. Remarkably, my palms get sweaty and I find myself getting defensive but I keep my cool and manage to answer these questions as though I am the CEO of this fictitious company. When it’s all over, I get the point—all of us need to be prepared., In the meantime, back up your computer., Cristina Quinn is a reporter and news anchor.]"

But Will It Fail In New York Like It Did In Massachusetts?],"[With Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders at his side, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced yesterday a proposal that would make in-state college tuition free for eligible students in his state., The proposal—which Cuomo says would be rolled out over the next three years—would make both two-year and four-year programs free at first for families earning less than $100,000, and eventually encompassing families earning less than $125,000 per year by 2019., But Paul Reville, professor at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education and head of the Education Redesign Lab, said it would likely face the same barriers that blocked similar programs in Massachusetts: cost., ""Nobody is really opposed to the idea,"" he said. ""A lot of people subscribe to [the idea] that the new reality is thirteen years of K-12 education is not enough. You're going to need at least a couple of years of secondary education to be employable in a 21st-century high-skill, high-knowledge market."", ""The question is,"" he continued, ""can we afford it right now?"", Reville pointed out that Governor Deval Patrick proposed making community colleges free in Massachusetts in back in 2007. At the time, Massachusetts would have been the first state to do so (Oregon and Tennessee have since implemented similar plans.) But the proposal was quickly stymied by the economic realities of the 2008 financial crisis., ""We had it on paper,"" Reville said. ""We had a whole ramp-up plan about how we were going to do it. Then, by the summer of 2008, we found ourselves making 9C cuts, cutting back the budget."", For now, Cuomo maintains that the program would carry a fairly modest price tag, costing the state about $163 million per year. But lawmakers there are already skeptical about the administration's estimates—and its ability to pay., As New York Assemblywoman Deborah Glick put it: ""The cost estimate of $163 million begs the question: If it costs so little, why haven’t we done it before?”, To hear more from Paul Reville, tune in to Boston Public Radio above., Amanda McGowan is a producer for Boston Public Radio. ]"

It took a lot of collaboration,” said Raimondo., To construct the wind farm, which cost $300 million to build, her administration needed to get the go-ahead from deep sea fishermen and residents concerned about obstructed views, among other parties., “An advantage of being the smallest state is you can get everybody in the room and say, ‘This is what we’re doing,’” said Raimondo., The wind farm will power about 17,000 homes on Block Island, and will eliminate nearly 50,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions a year, according to the New York Times., She also said state pride pushed the group to compromise and work through differences., “We have a lot of pride in how clean our bay is, our fishermen, our ocean,” she said. “The Ocean State ought to be the site of the first offshore wind farm.”, Gina Raimondo is the governor of Rhode Island.
