72,First of two parts  Here s Part 2  Note  Report contains some offensive language BOSTON — With Boston public school students back in class  we recall a very different start to school 40 years ago  Then  classes began a week late to give students  schools and the police extra time to prepare for the first day of court ordered desegregation Earlier that summer of 1974  federal District Court Judge W  Arthur Garrity ruled that the Boston School Committee had deliberately segregated the city’s schools  creating one system for blacks and another for whites — separate  unequal and unconstitutional The remedy to achieve racial balance and desegregate schools was busing  Some 18 000 black and white students were ordered to take buses to schools outside of their neighborhoods  The Words  The Spit  Here s how The Boston Globe headlined that first day of court ordered busing   Boston Schools Desegregated  Opening Day Generally Peaceful   The headline was reassuring  if not exactly accurate  It was only Phase 1 of the federal desegregation plan  Just 59 of 201 schools were desegregated that day  and it was far from peaceful at South Boston High School Southie was ground zero for anti busing rage  Hundreds of white demonstrators — children and their parents — pelted a caravan of 20 school buses carrying students from nearly all black Roxbury to all white South Boston  The police wore riot gear One of those children was Regina Williams And Williams didn t  And neither did many other students assigned to the five schools affected by busing in Roxbury and South Boston  Just 20 white students attended Roxbury High that first day  and no whites showed up at South Boston High On the second day of school  South Boston High headmaster William Reid reported that things hadn t improved much at the five schools  I Don’t Want Nothing To Do With It South Boston parents who were most opposed to busing formed the group Restore Our Alienated Rights  They wanted to keep their children in neighborhood schools  and issued a call for whites to boycott classes  The group made up lyrics to the tune  My Way   sung by Frank Sinatra   Tonight  let us unite  and do it ROAR s way   the song said in part The song may have been hokey  but the white student boycott was devastatingly effective At the time a reporter for WGBH TV interviewed a student named Mike  Here it is Mike   Why am I not going to school  I m boycotting  Reporter   How come  Mike   How come  Why do you think  The cops are up there  they re locking up the schools from the outside  Plus there s busing  I don t want nothing to do with it  Reporter   How long are you going to stay out  Mike   All year  Reporter   If you stay out all year  what are you going to do next year  You re going to lose a whole year  Mike   Then I guess I ll have to lose it  That s all there is to it  Reporter   Do you think this is going to stop it  Mike   I think if we get a total boycott it ll stop it  The year busing began  there were 86 000 students enrolled in Boston public schools  more than half of them white  Today there are 54 000 students  and less than 14 percent are white Many parents who could afford it moved to the suburbs or sent their children to private or parochial schools  despite a plea by the city s Catholic leader  Cardinal Humberto Medeiros  not to disrupt desegregation efforts Among those who took his child out of public school was the president of the Boston School Committee  John Kerrigan  an opponent of busing  He said the schools were unsafe  Boston Has Gotten Out Of Control From the start of busing  police at South Boston High outnumbered students  Yet the violence continued  Then Mayor Kevin White  making a rare TV appeal  declared a curfew and banned crowds near the school  but said there was only so much he could do to protect students and enforce the federal mandate Law enforcement tactics toughened  and what had started out as an anti busing problem soon included anti police sentiment  Many of the police officers were Irish from Southie A decade later Roache would become Boston police commissioner  But as the 1974 school year wore on  there was no peace By October The Boston Globe wrote   What we prayed wouldn t happen has happened  The city of Boston has gotten out of control  A group of whites in South Boston brutally beat a Haitian resident of Roxbury who had driven into their neighborhood  A month later some black students stabbed a white student at South Boston High  The school was shut down for a month Then Gov  Francis Sargent put the National Guard on alert  State police were called in and would remain on duty on the streets of South Boston for the next three years But President Gerald Ford refused to mobilize U S  marshals  saying it was up to federal court judges to enforce the desegregation order The disagreement among city  state and federal officials took its toll on the very students the leaders were supposed to be helping  These white high schoolers were documented in the civil rights series  Eyes on the Prize  Four decades have passed since these students voiced their frustrations and fears for the future  but Ray Flynn — South Boston s state representative during the busing crisis  later mayor of the city and now 75 and retired — says they still have not been heard Later this month  WBUR is organizing an on air busing roundtable  We want to hear from former BPS students who were bused to school in 1974  If that s you  and you re interested in participating in our conversation  please send a note to reporter Asma Khalid This segment aired on September 4  2014

122,Pope Francis declared his two predecessors John XXIII and John Paul II saints on Sunday before hundreds of thousands of people in St  Peter s Square  an unprecedented ceremony made even more historic by the presence of retired Pope Benedict XVI Never before has a reigning and retired pope celebrated Mass together in public  much less at an event honoring two of their most famous predecessors Benedict s presence was a reflection of the balancing act that Francis envisioned when he decided to canonize John and John Paul together  showing the unity of the Catholic Church by honoring popes beloved to conservatives and progressives alike Francis took a deep breath and paused for a moment before reciting the saint making formula in Latin  as if moved by the history he was about to make He said that after deliberating  consulting and praying for divine assistance  we declare and define Blessed John XXIII and John Paul II be saints and we enroll them among the saints  decreeing that they are to be venerated as such by the whole church  Applause broke out from a crowd that stretched from St  Peter s to the Tiber River and beyond Benedict was sitting off to the side of the altar with other cardinals  He had arrived in the square on his own to cheers and applause  wearing white vestments and white bishops  miter  He stood to greet Italy s president and later Francis when he arrived  and sang along during the hymns that followed the canonization rite Italy s interior ministry predicted 1 million people would watch the Mass from the square  the streets surrounding it and nearby piazzas where giant TV screens were set up to accommodate the crowds eager to follow along By the time the ceremony began  Via della Conciliazione  the main boulevard leading from the square  nearby streets and the bridges across the Tiber were packed Polish pilgrims carrying the red and white flags of John Paul s beloved homeland had been among the first to push into the square well before sunrise  as the human chains of neon vested civil protection workers trying to maintain order finally gave up and let them in Most of those who arrived first at St  Peter s had camped out overnight nearby on air mattresses and sleeping pads  Others hadn t slept at all and took part in the all night prayer vigils hosted at a dozen churches in downtown Rome By mid morning  the scene in the square was quiet and subdued   perhaps due to the chilly gray skies and cumulative lack of sleep   unlike the rollicking party atmosphere of John Paul s May 2011 beatification when bands of young people sang and danced in the hours before the Mass Benedict had promised to remain  hidden from the world  after resigning last year  but Francis has coaxed him out of retirement and urged him to take part in the public life of the church In a dress rehearsal of sorts  Benedict attended the February ceremony in which Francis installed 19 new cardinals  But celebrating Mass together with Francis was something else entirely  a first for the 2 000 year old institution and a reflection of Francis  desire to show the continuity in the papacy  despite different personalities  priorities and politics Pope John XIII  who reigned from 1958 1963  is a hero to liberal Catholics for having convened the Second Vatican Council  The meetings brought the church into the modern era by allowing Mass to be celebrated in local languages rather than Latin and by encouraging greater dialogue with people of other faiths  particularly Jews During his quarter century papacy from 1978 2005  John Paul II helped topple communism through his support of Poland s Solidarity movement  His globe trotting papacy and launch of the wildly popular World Youth Days invigorated a new generation of Catholics  while his defense of core church teaching heartened conservatives after the turbulent 1960s Kings  queens  presidents and prime ministers from more than 90 countries attended  Some 20 Jewish leaders from the U S   Israel  Italy  Francis  native Argentina and Poland were also taking part  in a clear sign of their appreciation for the great strides made in Catholic Jewish relations under John  John Paul   and their successors celebrating their sainthood

138,When the Winter Olympics officially began with opening ceremonies Friday  one former Olympian and current Boston College Law student was there to cheer on the athletes Caitlin Cahow  along with tennis star Billie Jean King and figure skater Brian Boitano  was chosen by President Obama to represent the U S  as part of its official delegation  All three of them are openly gay  And although the White House hasn t said it explicitly  their selection is widely considered a rebuke of Russia s policy banning so called homosexual propaganda to young people WBUR s All Things Considered host Sacha Pfeiffer spoke with Cahow — who won a silver medal in 2010 and a bronze in 2006 as a member of the U S  Women s Ice Hockey Team — at BC s law library before she left for Sochi and asked her what it feels like to know she s intended to be a symbol Caitlin Cahow  I think I want to represent all Americans  you know  Not just one community  At the same time  I m very proud to be representing the LGBT community  I think it s really just an honor in every possible way  But  more importantly  I really identify with what Brian Boitano has said about his life  you know  He s not just gay  He s never thought of himself that way  That s the same way that I am  I m a daughter and a sister and a student and an athlete and an Olympian and an American  And it s just one more thing that makes up who I am Sacha Pfeiffer  While you re there at the Olympics  do you feel any desire or any obligation to be outspoken on gay rights issues  take part in protests of any kind I don t  I m going to be in Russia representing my country  representing myself  And I think that my presence there is far more indicative than any words I could possibly say of how many great strides our nation has made in the last few years  just in my lifetime alone  I mean  I went to college the year that the Goodridge case was handed down in Massachusetts The one that legalized same sex marriage here I went to Harvard University and remember the day  I never thought that I would see that  Even growing up on the east coast in a very supportive environment  I never thought that I would see gay marriage and just to see where we ve come If you were to get a chance while you re in Russia to talk to President Vladimir Putin or some other high level Russian government official  or make some kind of public statement  what would you want to say on the issue of gay equality That regardless of who you are or who you love  there s a common human dignity that flows between all of us  And I want to exhibit the best qualities of myself that I find I ve learned in part through my status as an Olympian However  this is a government in Russia — or at least the head of the government  Putin — who seems not to share that view based on recent political moves he s made  So what would you want to say to him I think it s the same thing that I say to anyone who disagrees with me or with my life  You know  I m not going to change everyone s mind  And far be it for me to cast stones  To me  the most effective form of protest stems from people like Martin Luther King  who had a peaceful and positive message  That s the same kind of protest that I wish to engage in  It s important to remember that while I am a presidential delegate  I m not a politician and I m not a diplomat  I don t speak for the United States of America  I speak for myself Is there anything frustrating about the attention you re getting  I mean  it s an enormous honor  a great opportunity  Yet now it s suddenly   Caitlin Cahow  Openly Gay Athlete   It s the thing that comes after the comma after your name  every time you re identified It certainly has changed my Google hits  But it is what it is  I ve gotten so much attention for my private life  And for the month since the announcement  on certain days it s really felt like I m in a time warp  So yeah  in a lot of ways  one of my main goals for the rest of my life is going to be living in a world where these classifications no longer matter and you don t just live and die by a box that you have to check on a form And what is your official role supposed to be  Has the White House spelled out for you what it would like you to do while you re there My official role is to represent the United States and cheer on our amazing athletes and make sure that they know that they are 100 percent supported by our nation  because they are  And that s what I hope comes from this Olympics  There s a lot of lead up  there s a lot of controversy  But when the games open  it s about the athletes  in my mind  So I want to make sure that they get their moment to shine Do you expect to wish you were out there playing It ll be difficult not to be on the ice  I ve dedicated so much of my life to being an athlete  But it s a new opportunity for me to represent my country  And I m excited to take it all in and not have to worry about  you know  getting sleep so that I can compete the next day  It s going to be an amazing opportunity to really witness and take in and experience the Olympics as a spectator  I m very excited This segment aired on February 7

the goal scoring dynamo and late season acquisition who led the playoffs with 14 goals to win the first title of his 13 season NHL career The trophy soon went to Doughty and Jeff Carter  who became the seventh and eighth players to win an Olympic gold medal and the Stanley Cup in the same year  Leading scorer Anze Kopitar raised it for the second time  and Quick gave a triumphant shout after his turn Chris Kreider scored a power play goal and Brian Boyle added a tiebreaking short handed goal late in the second period for the Rangers  who showed no nerves while facing elimination for the sixth time this spring Both teams had tantalizing chances in overtime  from shots off posts by Ryan McDonagh and Toffoli to Kreider s failed breakaway late in the first OT  Rick Nash had an open net in the second OT  but Slava Voynov deflected the shot just high with the shaft of his stick Lundqvist stopped 48 shots in another standout performance for the Eastern Conference champions  but the Rangers repeatedly came up one goal short against the Kings despite their goalie s brilliance Los Angeles  2012 title run was defined by that raw  eighth seeded team s improbable dominance  but the second crown was all about resilience for the third place team in the Pacific Division After fighting through three straight seven game series to emerge from the tough Western Conference  the Kings won the first three games of the finals  starting with consecutive OT wins on goals by Williams and Brown Game 5 was the Kings  26th playoff game of the spring  matching the NHL record for the longest postseason run  Los Angeles has played 64 playoff games over the last three years  setting another league record The Kings raised the Stanley Cup just over seven weeks after they faced a 3 0 first round series deficit against San Jose  Los Angeles confidently won four straight elimination games to become the fourth team in NHL history to rally from that deficit  and then won two more elimination games in a second round series against Anaheim The defending champion Blackhawks forced Los Angeles to a seventh game in Chicago  but Martinez s deflected overtime goal sent the Kings into the franchise s third Stanley Cup finals After three straight wins  New York staved off elimination with a 2 1 victory in Game 4 at Madison Square Garden Staples Center was packed well before the opening faceoff with fans eager for another celebration  rocking the arena with chants of  Go Kings Go   while both teams were still in their dressing rooms Los Angeles started out with yet another big game score from Williams  He got his ninth goal of the postseason on a loose puck after linemates Dwight King and Jarret Stoll applied pressure on Lundqvist The Rangers finally equalized when McDonagh found Kreider in front  Boyle then got a stunner after Carl Hagelin got the puck away from Voynov  skating around Doughty and wiring a pinpoint shot into the far top corner But the Kings showed the same determination that has characterized their entire spring run  and they finally equalized with Mats Zuccarello in the box Doughty s long shot hit Lundqvist in the chest and dropped in front of him before Gaborik alertly poked it between his legs for the Slovak star s latest goal in a spectacular postseason with his new club That s when the nail biting hockey started   and roughly 46 minutes later  Martinez drove in the final nail

146,Mario Goetze produced the piece of individual skill that Lionel Messi couldn t muster With two quick  deft touches  Goetze ended Germany s 24 year wait for another World Cup title with an extra time winner against Argentina on Sunday   denying Messi the one title he needs to forever take his place among the game s all time greats It was the moment of brilliance that ensured Germany s 1 0 victory in a tight and tense final Goetze  who wasn t born when West Germany beat Argentina in the 1990 final  controlled a cross with his chest in the 113th minute and in one fluid motion volleyed the ball past goalkeeper Sergio Romero and inside the far post from five yards out It delivered Germany its fourth World Cup title  equal second with Italy on the list of all time champions and just behind Brazil s five At the final whistle  Germany players fell into a pile in a mid pitch celebration  Messi walked past them with his hands on his hips   still in the shadow of his compatriot Diego Maradona  who led his country to the 1986 title The 22 year old Goetze went on as a substitute for Miroslav Klose near the end of regulation time and his fresh legs made the difference Andre Schuerrle broke down the left flank  sending his cross into the area  and the Bayern Munich midfielder did the rest with a clinical finish  The goal echoed that of Andres Iniesta four years ago  when the midfielder scored in similar fashion but from the other side of the area to give Spain a 1 0 extra time win over the Netherlands It went entirely to script  according to Germany coach Joachim Loew Germany became the first European team to win a World Cup in the Americas  and the victory ends a string of near misses since winning its last major title at the 1996 European Championship  The team lost the 2002 World Cup final to Brazil  the Euro 2008 final to Spain and was eliminated in the semifinals in both 2006 and 2010 Argentina had not been back in the final since that 1990 loss  and has now been beaten by Germany in the last three World Cups It is Germany s first World Cup title as a unified nation  having won as West Germany in 1954  1974 and 1990 The Germans faced Argentina in both the 1986 and 1990 finals  during Maradona s heyday  This time  they were up against Messi  the four time world player of the year who has set a slew of scoring records in leading Barcelona to every major club title and is widely considered the best player since Maradona But in the biggest game of his career  Messi came up short He had one good chance to score when he was sent free in the area just after the halftime break  but sent his shot wide  It was a difficult angle  but still the type of chance he so often converts for Barcelona Messi threatened intermittently throughout the match  but was effectively smothered by the German defense  His free kick in the 120th minute went well high Messi  who scored four goals in the group stage but none in the knockout rounds  then had to trudge alone up the stairs of the Maracana Stadium to accept the Golden Ball award for the tournament s best player  shaking hands with German Chancellor Angela Merkel along the way Until Goetze s winning goal  the game was more notable for top class defending than creative attacking  but both teams had their share of chances Gonzalo Higuain fired wide when gifted a chance in a one on one with goalkeeper Manuel Neuer  and later had a goal ruled out for offside Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes hit the post just before halftime with a header Germany had entered the game as the favorite after its 7 1 semifinal drubbing of Brazil  But Argentina proved to be an entirely different proposition After Germany s last win in 1990  then coach Franz Beckenbauer predicted that a unified Germany would be  unbeatable  in the future  It took 24 years to prove him right but with young players like Goetze  the next wait may not be as long

192,Mike Nichols  the director of matchless versatility who brought fierce wit  caustic social commentary and wicked absurdity to such film  TV and stage hits as  The Graduate    Angels in America  and  Monty Python s Spamalot   has died  He was 83 The death was confirmed by ABC News President James Goldston on Thursday  Nichols died Wednesday evening The family will hold a private service this week  a memorial will be held at a later date  Goldston said During a career spanning more than 50 years  Nichol  who was married to ABC s Diane Sawyer  managed to be both an insider and outsider  an occasional White House guest and friend to countless celebrities who was as likely to satirize the elite as he was to mingle with them  A former stand up performer who began his career in a groundbreaking comedy duo with Elaine May and whose work brought him an Academy Award  a Grammy and multiple Tony and Emmy honors  Nichols had a remarkable gift for mixing edgy humor and dusky drama His 1966 film directing debut  Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf   unforgettably captured the vicious yet sparkling and sly dialogue of Edward Albee s play  as a couple  Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor  torment each other over deep seated guilt and resentment Similarly  Nichols  2001 TV adaptation of the play  Wit  packed biting levity within the stark story of a college professor dying of ovarian cancer Nichols  who won directing Emmys for both  Angels in America  and  Wit   said he liked stories about the real lives of real people and that humor inevitably pervades even the bleakest of such tales He was a wealthy  educated man who often mocked those just like him  never more memorably than in  The Graduate   which shot Dustin Hoffman to fame in the 1967 story of an earnest young man rebelling against his elders  expectations  Nichols himself would say that he identified with Hoffman s awkward  perpetually flustered Benjamin Braddock Mixing farce and Oedipal drama  Nichols managed to capture a generation s discontent without ever mentioning Vietnam  civil rights or any other issues of the time  But young people laughed hard when a family friend advised Benjamin that the road to success was paved with  plastics  or at Benjamin s lament that he felt like life was  some kind of game  but the rules don t make any sense to me  They re being made up by all the wrong people  I mean no one makes them up  They seem to make themselves up  At the time  Nichols was  just trying to make a nice little movie   he recalled in 2005 at a retrospective screening of  The Graduate    It wasn t until when I saw it all put together that I realized this was something remarkable  Nichols won the best director Oscar for  The Graduate   which co starred Anne Bancroft as an aging temptress pursuing Hoffman  whose character responds with the celebrated line   Mrs  Robinson  you re trying to seduce me  Divorced three times  Nichols married TV journalist Diane Sawyer in 1988  He admitted in 2013 that many of his film and stage projects explored a familiar  naughty theme Not just actors  but great actors  clamored to work with Nichols  who studied acting with Lee Strasberg and had an empathy that helped bring out the best from the talent he put in front of the camera Nichols often collaborated with Jack Nicholson  Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson  Other stars who worked with Nichols included Al Pacino   Angels in America    Gene Hackman and Robin Williams   The Birdcage    Harrison Ford  Melanie Griffith and Sigourney Weaver   Working Girl   and Julia Roberts   Closer    In 2007  Nichols brought out  Charlie Wilson s War   starring Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts Just as he moved easily among stage  screen and television  Nichols fearlessly switched from genre to genre  Onstage  he tackled comedy   The Odd Couple    classics   Uncle Vanya   and musicals   The Apple Tree    Spamalot   the latter winning him his sixth Tony for directing  On Broadway  he won nine Tonys  for directing the plays  Barefoot in the Park   1964    Luv  and  The Odd Couple   1965    Plaza Suite   1968    The Prisoner of Second Avenue   1972    The Real Thing   1984   and Arthur Miller s  Death of a Salesman   2012   He has also won in other categories  for directing the musical  Monty Python s Spamalot   2005   and for producing  Annie   1977  and  The Real Thing   1984  Though known for films with a comic edge  Nichols branched into thrillers with  Day of the Dolphin   horror with  Wolf  and real life drama with  Silkwood   Along with directing for television  he was an executive producer for the 1970s TV series  Family  Nichols  golden touch failed him on occasion with such duds as the anti war satire  Catch 22   with Alan Arkin in an adaptation of Joseph Heller s best seller and  What Planet Are You From    an unusually tame comedy for Nichols that starred Garry Shandling and Annette Bening Born Michael Igor Peschkowsky on Nov  6  1931  in Berlin  Nichols fled Nazi Germany for America at age 7 with his family  He recalled to the AP in 1996 that at the time  he could say only two things in English   I don t speak English  and  Please don t kiss me  He said he fell in love with the power of the stage at age 15 when the mother of his then girlfriend gave them theater tickets to the second night of the debut of  A Streetcar Named Desire  starring Marlon Brando in 1947 Nichols attended the University of Chicago but left to study acting in New York  He returned to Chicago  where he began working with May in the Compass Players  a comedy troupe that later became the Second City May and Nichols developed their great improvisational rapport into a saucy  sophisticated stage show that took on sex  marriage  family and other subjects in a frank manner that titillated and startled audiences of the late 1950s and early  60s Their Broadway show   An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May   earned them a Grammy for best comedy recording in 1961 The two split up soon after  though they reunited in the 1990s  with May writing screenplays for Nichols   Primary Colors  and  The Birdcage   adapted from the French farce  La Cage aux Folles  After the break with May  Nichols found his true calling as a director  his early stage work highlighted by  Barefoot in the Park    The Odd Couple    Plaza Suite  and  The Prisoner of Second Avenue   each of which earned him Tonys Other honors included Oscar nominations for directing  Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf     Silkwood  and  Working Girl   a best picture nomination for producing  The Remains of the Day   and a lifetime achievement award from the Directors Guild of America in 2004 Never one to analyze his career and look for common themes  Nichols would shrug off questions that sought to link his far flung body of work    AP Drama Writer Mark Kennedy contributed to this report

201,From his parade stand as Boston s mayor  Thomas Menino saw three presidents  five governors and eight world champion teams pass by  He set his own world record in the long jump  perhaps  by getting to be mayor in the first place But once there  Menino set another record for longevity  He had his fingers in everything  you could find him everywhere  A 2009 Globe poll showed that 57 percent of city residents — not including school kids — had personally met Menino  And he still had five more years in office Former City Councilor Michael McCormack says Menino  who passed away Thursday at 71 after a battle with cancer  never wanted to be anything more than mayor Mayor Kevin White had dreams of national office  So too did Mayor Ray Flynn  who left the job to be ambassador to the Vatican  then ran for Congress  Menino never set his sights farther south than Hyde Park and his home in Readville Menino’s daily rounds were legendary  Days started at dawn — he told reporters to call him at home at 5 a m  if they ever had any questions  It was the same time he expected associates to tee up for golf  Days generally ended with the last neighborhood meeting Menino started the year 1993 as a district councilor  representing Hyde Park and Roslindale  without a citywide base of power  That Menino ever became mayor required all the stars in the heavens to align If Bill Clinton had not defeated George Bush   If Mayor Ray Flynn had not campaigned so hard for Clinton   If the president of the Boston City Council  Chris Iannella  had not died and created a vacancy   If Ray Flynn had not pushed city councilors into making Menino president   And if Clinton had not paid Flynn back by naming him ambassador to the Vatican       then Tom Menino would never have become acting mayor in July 1993 Friends say that Menino never let go of his resentment at the idea he only became mayor by accident  and he never stopped running to keep the position he never thought he could achieve Chance and coincidence may have made Menino acting mayor  but he needed more than that to get elected mayor in November 1993 — and he showed his political skill by acting like he was the mayor Here Menino emerged as the Urban Mechanic  Mr  Nuts and Bolts  He kept track of snow plows  street cleaning and potholes  Boston historian Jim Vrabel says Menino had seen how effective Flynn had been as an action figure mayor — going out into the neighborhoods  riding fire engines and snow plows  famously rescuing a Salvation Army Santa Claus from a burning car  and trying to heal the city s race wounds  Menino followed that example  but with less flash As the mayor of downtown  he was a notorious micromanager  He somewhat famously hated flat roofed skyscrapers  as he wrote in his recently published book  Mayor For A New America   So when a previously rejected developer returned to show Menino an alternative scale model he would like  the developer came with a dozen different tops  When the mayor pointed out the one he liked  the decision was made and the building went forward In some ways that saved time  because without Menino s approval  your projects did not go forward  even if you followed the permitting process He was well known for his public feuds and often called Tommy Thin Skinned  Back in the early years  when he was a body guy  constant companion and driver for Joe Timility  he had learned what it meant to be a loser from the brutal scarring mayoral election battles that Timility fought with the incumbent Kevin White  It was winner take all  Timility says In his book  Menino took a defiant stance to the critics  Sensitive to those who said that the  urban mechanic  lacked a big vision  he derided visionaries as people who can t get anything done  To those who called him a vindictive autocrat  he wrote that  fear is power  Sixty floors up in the Hancock Tower  Jack Connors — a business magnate  power broker and philanthropist — takes a high minded view  When asked about Menino s personality  the former ad man recalls an old TV ad for Perdue Chicken Connors expresses the greatest admiration for Menino When Menino asked Connors to help city kids dodging bullets in unsafe neighborhoods  Connors pledged $10 million  raised another $52 million and turned the city owned end of Long Island into Camp Harborview  which serves 800 kids each summer and beyond This segment aired on October 30  2014 
202,The Boston Bruins lost the game to the New York Islanders 3 2 and then waited to find out how long they will be without their captain and No  1 defenseman  Zdeno Chara The 2009 Norris Trophy winner left Thursday night s game in the first period with an undisclosed injury and didn t return  Coach Claude Julien said after the game he had no update  but inside the Boston locker room  Chara s teammates seemed resigned to a long absence Former Bruins backup Chad Johnson stopped 30 shots  and Kyle Okposo scored the go ahead goal in the second period to help New York snap a two game losing streak  Frans Nielsen and Cal Clutterbuck also scored for the Islanders Milan Lucic added goals for Boston  Niklas Svedberg  making his third start as Vezina Trophy winner Tuukka Rask got the night off  made 35 saves The Bruins played the Canadian national anthem and observed a moment of silence in memory of the soldier who was killed at the war memorial in Ottawa on Wednesday The team also played a highlight video for former Bruins defenseman Johnny Boychuk  a member of the 2011 Stanley Cup champion team who was traded to the Islanders on the eve of the season  He belatedly realized the cheering was for him  flashed a smile  and finally took off his glove and waved to the crowd Johnson served as Rask s backup last season Chara collided with Islanders captain John Tavares midway through the first  then played one more shift that ended with 8 04 remaining in the period  There was no outward indication of an injury at that time The team didn t elaborate on why Chara didn t return to the bench at the start of the second period except to confirm that it was an injury  The 6 foot 9 Slovakian  a third round pick of the Islanders in 1996  spends more time on the ice than any other Bruins player Julien said he wouldn t have an update until doctors have a chance to look at Chara The Islanders had a goal waved off in the first few minutes for goalie interference  but that barely slowed them down  They made it 1 0 six minutes into the game when Nielsen got to a puck in the crease and made a one handed reach with his stick to tip it in Lucic crashed the net for his first goal of the season to make it 1 1 near the end of the first  then Okposo made it 2 1 just 90 seconds into the second period Clutterbuck gave New York a 3 1 lead midway through the second before the Bruins mounted sustained pressure in the Islanders  zone in the third and cut the deficit to one on Kelly s rebound with 10 11 remaining

273,Susan Dackerman  former Carl A  Weyerhaeser curator of prints at the Harvard Art Museums and current consultative curator of prints  tells her friend Chris Barrett about the Harvard Art Museums  exhibit on Corita Kent   Corita Kent and the Language of Pop  Susan Dackerman  One of my colleagues asked me if I wanted to see this group of prints that his family had that had been made by Corita Kent  a nun and an artist working at a convent college in Los Angeles  And I was curious about the kind of art nuns made in the  60s  And they were similar to the work of artists we know really well  like Andy Warhol and Ed Ruscha and Roy Lichtenstein Chris Barrett  Why the 1960s Dackerman  The 1960s was the time of great religious reform under Vatican II  a movement to modernize Catholic liturgy  to make that ritual more relevant to contemporary life  Corita Kent and the nuns of Immaculate Heart were very much in favor of that kind of revitalization of Catholicism  finding a younger audience And I think that what happened is she saw pop art would serve to better convey ideas about the church than older forms that were  at that point  anachronistic  And so  where Warhol used Campbell soup  she too used consumer culture and its slogans to find a new scripture for modern Christian life There was a Chevy dealership that used the slogan   See the man who can save you the most   And then the tagline is  of course   Your Chevy dealer   And when she used that in her artwork  needless to say  she left off the part about the Chevy dealer  But she found in these modern slogans the means to articulate a new gospel  in a way Barrett  If you were to wander from room to room in this exhibition  the works you ve selected  is there a tone that emerges from them Dackerman  Her prints are comprised primarily of phrases  slogans  the words from street signs  She uses vivid  fluorescent inks  and the images just seem so happy and appealing  But the words usually seem somewhat disparate and disconnected so it s up to the viewer reader to make meaning by assimilating all of those different passages  And often  that meaning is quite subtle or subversive Barrett  Lots of people are going to come see this exhibition  What do you want them to walk out the door thinking about Dackerman  That what was important about the  60s is still important now  That those problems didn t get solved  That art can make the world a better place  And that there are people in the world that make a huge effort to make the world a better place Produced by Dan Collison with interviews recorded by StoryCorps  Harvard Art Museums   Corita Kent and the Language of Pop  is supported in part by an award from the National Endowment for the Arts and major corporate support from National Grid  Harvard Common Spaces has also provided support for the StoryCorps project WBUR is the media partner for the StoryCorps project  StoryCorps is an independent nonprofit organization  Its mobile recording booth travels the country recording conversations among loved ones  The recordings are archived at The American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress  and excerpts can be heard weekly on WBUR’s Morning Edition This segment aired on October 26  2015

278,For the first time since the civil rights movement  the Confederate flag was removed entirely from the South Carolina Statehouse  in a swift ceremony Friday before thousands of people who cheered as the Civil War era banner was lowered from a 30 foot flagpole Many people believed the flag would fly indefinitely in this state  which was the first to leave Union  but the killing of nine black church members during a Bible study in Charleston last month changed that sentiment  reigniting calls to bring down Confederate flags and symbols across the nation Dylann Roof  a white man who was photographed with the Confederate flag  is charged in the shooting deaths  and authorities have called the killings a hate crime The crowd chanted  USA  USA  and  hey  hey  hey  goodbye  as an honor guard of South Carolina troopers lowered the flag during a 6 minute ceremony  Gov  Nikki Haley stood on the Statehouse steps along with family members of the victims and other dignitaries  While she didn t speak  she nodded and smiled in the direction of the crowd after someone shouted   Thank you governor  Haley supported the flag before the shooting  but the Republican had a change of heart in the days after the killings  urging legislators to pass a bill before the end of the summer  She signed the legislation Thursday As she looked on  two troopers rolled the flag and tied it up with a string  They handed it to a black trooper who brought it to the Statehouse steps  When the trooper handed it to a state archivist  the governor clapped President Barack Obama tweeted minutes after the flag was down  saying it was  a sign of good will and healing and a meaningful step towards a better future   Obama delivered a eulogy at the funeral for state Sen  Clementa Pinckney  who was also pastor of the church where the killings took place The honor guard who took the flag down was the same group of men who carried Pinckney s coffin into the Statehouse for a viewing last month Denise Quarles  mother  Myra Thompson  received her license to preach just hours before the June 17 shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston Quarles said the group known as the Emanuel 9 smiled from heaven as the Confederate flag was taken down for good A van brought the flag to the nearby Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum  There  it eventually will be housed in a multimillion dollar shrine lawmakers promised to build as part of a deal to get a bill passed removing the flag South Carolina s leaders first flew the battle flag over the Statehouse dome in 1961 to mark the 100th anniversary of the Civil War  It remained there to represent official opposition to the civil rights movement Decades later  mass protests against the flag by those who said it was a symbol of racism and white supremacy led to a compromise in 2000 with lawmakers who insisted that it symbolized Southern heritage and states  rights  The two sides came to an agreement to move the flag from the dome to a 30 foot pole next to a Confederate monument in front of the Statehouse Many thought it would stay there  Now  even that flagpole will be torn down  No timetable was set on that Patsy Eaddy  a black woman  said there was a  sense of embarrassment  of seeing the flag still flying after all these years  She attended the ceremony to see an important milestone in the civil rights movement People who supported removing the flag chanted  take it down  before the ceremony and vastly outnumbered those who were upset about the move Haley did not answer questions  but earlier Friday on NBC s  Today  show  she said   No one should ever drive by the Statehouse and feel pain  No one should ever drive by the Statehouse and feel like they don t belong  Still  others were not celebrating  Clad in a black dress similar to those worn in the 19th century  Cindy Lampley clutched a poster showing photos of ancestors who fought for the Confederacy  Lampley said she is a historical reenactor who fears removing symbols like the flag dishonors her relatives who fought for the Southern cause 
279,The tradition of teams cutting down the nets after basketball championships has migrated to the ice  an idea hatched by Minnesota women s coach Brad Frost After overpowering Harvard to win their third title in four years  the Gophers savored their chance to slice away Megan Wolfe scored late in the first period and Amanda Leveille was stout in the crease with 19 saves  setting Minnesota up for a 4 1 victory and an exuberant celebration on Sunday Hannah Brandt  Megan Lorence and Rachael Bona had goals in the third period for Minnesota  34 3 4   which returned the trophy to the west after a one year slip He had a piece of the net stuck into a backward black cap commemorating the title  as he sat at the podium with smiling seniors Bona and Rachel Ramsey There was no such joy last year when the Gophers lost to Clarkson in the title game in Connecticut  the first time one of the three Western Collegiate Hockey Association powers didn t take the trophy in 15 seasons of NCAA sponsored competition Sarah Edney s bad angle shot from the left corner slipped past Leveille with 4 33 left  trimmed the lead to 2 1 and gave Harvard  27 6 3  hope  but Lorence answered with a wrist flip past Crimson goalie Emerance Maschmeyer less than 90 seconds later Then came the empty netter by Bona  and soon after the Gophers were leaping off the bench  flinging their helmets and sticks upward and piling on top of Leveille The Gophers got to play for the title on their home ice for the second time in three years  in front of a loud capacity crowd announced at 3 400  The majority of the tickets sold out more than two months ago Leveille  who made 34 saves in the 3 1 semifinal win over Wisconsin  allowed five goals in the championship game last year This time  Ramsey  Wolfe  Lee Stecklein  Sydney Baldwin  Milica McMillen and Kelsey Cline led another stifling performance on the blue line in front of Leveille The Gophers brought an end to end energy that produced a 14 6 shots on goal advantage in the first period  Just when they were in danger of letting that domination go to waste  Wolfe sent the puck into the upper right corner out of Maschmeyer s reach for the lead with 51 seconds left before the break Harvard had the Gophers on their heels in the second period  but the Gophers and their senior leaders Bona  Lorence and Ramsey had the title in their sights down the stretch Minnesota s attack was too much  Ramsey pinged a shot off the post with a slap shot early in the third period  Then a few minutes later Brandt  who led the Gophers with 34 goals  knocked in a backhand off a slick pass by Maryanne Menefee Maschmeyer made 29 saves  The junior stopped 43 shots in the 2 1 semifinal victory over Boston College on Friday  the culmination of a remarkable rally from a 10 2 loss to the rival Eagles in late November that preceded a 10 game winning streak  Boston College had a 28 game unbeaten streak end in the semifinal This was the fourth NCAA runner up finish for Stone  who wrapped up her 20th year as head coach  Minnesota also beat the Crimson for consecutive titles in 2004 and 2005  and Harvard lost to Minnesota Duluth in the championship game in 2003  The Crimson won the American Women s College Hockey Alliance title in 1999 Minnesota matched Minnesota Duluth with its fifth title  Wisconsin has four

282,Someone should tell the hot new GOP presidential candidate that the Green Bay Packers already have a punter Wisconsin’s Republican Gov  Scott Walker was asked recently how he felt about the long established scientific fact known as evolution  His answer  “I’m going to punt on that one ”Perhaps what he knows is that polling shows 49 percent of Republican voters don t believe in evolution When New York’s ego obsessed ex Mayor Rudy Giuliani questioned President Obama’s patriotism at an event for Walker  the governor refused to disown the ridiculous comments  Walker sat just feet from Giuliani as the latter said he did not think the president loved America Asked about it the following morning  Walker would say only  “The mayor can speak for himself ” Later he offered this  “You should ask the president what he thinks about America ” adding  “I’ve never asked him so I don’t know ”Another punt  Asked if he believes President Obama is a Christian  he said “I don’t know ” He obviously hasn’t seen that the president regularly attends church with his family and frequently talks about his Christian faith  What Walker has seen is a 2014 survey that showed that 54 percent of Republicans still think Obama is “deep down” a Muslim In his strong second place showing at the Conservative Political Action Committee’s candidate bazaar last week  Walker really fumbled the ball  Asked how he’d combat ISIS  he declared  “I want a commander in chief who will do everything in their power to ensure that the threats from radical Islamic terrorists do not wash up on American soil ” He then compared his record as governor  “If I can take on 100 000 protesters  I can do the same across the world ”OK  tough guy  He was comparing his success in cutting benefits for his state’s school teachers  nurses  students  grandmothers  veterans  correctional officers and other union members who gathered in the state capital to protest his anti union efforts to his ability to defeat the barbaric  blood thirsty terrorism of ISIS marauders  who beheaded their prisoners and burned a captured Jordanian pilot alive in a cage Walker has already made organized labor his sworn enemy  a stance that endears him to conservative Republicans who have never held a minimum wage job  But he also sees union busting as smart foreign policy  arguing that “the Soviet Union treated Ronald Reagan more seriously” after he fired all 11 000 striking air traffic controllers in 2001  Vladimir Putin  are you listening Even before the CPAC convention  Walker led in a national survey by Public Policy Polling with 25 percent  compared to 18 percent for pediatric surgeon Benjamin Carson  and 17 percent for Jeb Bush  The pollster noted  “Walker has more than doubled his support since his 11  standing on our January national poll ” His ascent  the pollster said  “is driven by his appeal to the most conservative elements of the Republican electorate ” Indeed  he wowed Iowa’s religious right at its candidate cattle show in January and finished first in a Des Moines Register poll of likely attendees to the caucuses set for February 1  2016On abortion  he signed a controversial bill last year requiring a woman seeking an abortion to undergo an ultrasound and for doctors to show her the image of the fetus  On same sex marriage  Walker again punted  After a federal court struck down a state measure that defined marriage as between a man and woman  Walker observed  “It really doesn’t matter what I think now ” Walker supported the gay marriage ban as a legislator before he was governor  Pressed to elaborate  he characteristically deferred  “I don’t comment on everything out there ”He may have to comment on lots of things when he debates tough opponents like Chris Christie  Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz  Meanwhile  Tim Masthay will handle the punting duties for Wisconsin’s football team Dan Payne is a Democratic political analyst for WBUR

292,Church officials say that Pope Francis is likely to meet with victims of sexual abuse by priests when he comes to America this week    a sign of continuing turmoil and mistrust among Catholic parishioners following a series of scandals  And when critics call for more transparency and accountability  it s Cardinal Bernard Law they often point to Law was forced to resign as bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston after a series of stories by a team of investigative reporters at The Boston Globe found victims and uncovered documents showing that church authorities had protected pedophile priests from prosecution — a story that will be revisited by the release next month of a new movie called  Spotlight  But despite the disgrace that befell Cardinal Law in Boston  he found a comfortable and influential second career at the Vatican  Lied Through His Teeth The fall of Law began with a press conference he called in mid January 2002 — one week after a story published by The Boston Globe revealed that he had protected pedophile priests in the Boston Archdiocese The scene was Nixonian  A favorite of Pope John Paul II and a close friend of both Bush presidents  Cardinal Law was a red hatted power broker in Washington and Rome — the two capitals that counted most  But he was under siege — and his assertions were bold The Globe s Spotlight team of investigative reporters had revealed that Law and other bishops before him had covered up the priests  crimes against children  then moved the priests to new parishes and  as it turned out  new victims But during that press conference  the cardinal insisted not once  but three times that it was all in the past  Not a pedophile priest was still in service The Globe had a list of accused priests who were still in service and a wave of documents would shred what was left of Law s credibility A Dramatic  Fall From Grace Like Nixon  Law said he wouldn t go  But eventually he had to — a grand jury was afoot and both priests and parishioners were demanding he step down And yet  in a church where all roads lead to Rome  his catastrophic administration and disgrace in Boston was treated more like a flare up in the provinces  The newspaper of the Vatican Congregation of Bishops put his resignation on page 17 A poster boy for the sexual abuse scandal in one country  Law came to another  the Vatican  in May 2004  where protected and assisted by friends and allies he actually became more influential than he had ever been in Boston Pope John Paul II named Law archpriest of one of Rome s four papal basilicas  and its most magnificent  Santa Maria Maggiore  the first church dedicated to Mary A few months later  Law presided at the anniversary of the basilica s dedication more than 16 centuries earlier Above the cardinal and centuries of priceless art  white flower petals dropped from a ceiling gilded in gold  If there was a trace of official embarrassment over Law s presence  it was not apparent Instead  Law  who had only given up his position as archbishop of Boston  was allowed to keep his seat in the College of Cardinals  That meant keeping his seat in each and every one of eight Vatican Commissions  including the single most important department of all  the Congregation of Bishops And freed from the administrative and fundraising duties he once had in Boston  Law could devote all his time and influence to grooming a new generation of bishops as conservative as he was Law became the maker of American bishops  Ray Flynn  a former ambassador to the Vatican  can rattle off five or six of Law s personal staffers in Boston who Law got appointed bishops   He had a lot of power and a lot of friends at the Vatican   Flynn says That Law could exert such influence for so long was proof  critics said  the Vatican was not holding people to account for what they had done or failed to do  Not A Chance Law is about to turn 84 — he s grown old in Rome  listening to Italian church bells Now retired  he can no longer cast a vote to elect a new pope or to recommend the appointment of new bishops  But he still wears a red hat and  by all accounts  lives comfortably in the earliest Renaissance palace in Rome — the Palazzo della Cancelleria  or the Papal Chancellery I recently went to see him  on my way home from the Venice Film Festival  where  Spotlight  premiered  I was curious if Law had any reflections to make It s not hard to find him — he s often seen at diplomatic receptions  social events and conferences  He s not in hiding  He s in the phone book But according to people who know him  the one thing he won t talk about is what happened in Boston  He says he will leave that up to history Wall  the former priest and canon lawyer  has a different interpretation I called Law s longtime secretary from Boston  who had rejoined Law in 2005 after he got a lifetime appointment to the Vatican — another sign of Law s status  He told me   Not a chance  So the next morning I decided to call on the cardinal myself Outside Pallazzo della Cancelleria  I gave security my name  and they made the call to the cardinal  whom I ve interviewed many times in the past A phone conversation ensues in Italian  Then the man at the desk calls over another guard who speaks some English I get the translation simultaneously  It comes in one world in Italian —  Occupato   But three words in heavily accented English —  He s a be zee  There was nothing about coming back another time Correction  An earlier version of this post misspelled the Italian word for  busy   and also misspelled the word  canon  We regret the errors This article was originally published on September 22  2015 This segment aired on September 22  2015 
293,You ve probably heard of “flash mobs” — but how about “kraut mobs”  Well  a giant  kraut mob  — as in sauerkraut — will form at the Boston Public Market Sunday morning as part of the third annual Boston Fermentation Festival Fermented foods — from kimchi to miso to hard cider — are all the rage with foodies  the DIY urban homesteading crowd and chefs at all level and style of restaurants  But what role are these local kraut mobs playing in the larger  bubbling fermentation movement For the past two years Jeremy Ogusky — a self described  fermentation evangelist  — has been drawing crowds at farmers markets by staging these free sauerkraut making lessons  He told me that when people stumble upon one they re usually pretty surprised That’s why Ogusky calls these mass sauerkraut making events kraut mobs  The one I went to was at Powisset Farm  a property run by the Trustees of Reservations in Dover People of all ages swarmed around a table strewn with mason jars  cutting boards and literature about fermentation  They wielded their sharp knives with aplomb  diving and chiffonading purple and green heads of cabbage — although new  mobsters  mused about how much faster and easier it would be with a food processor Ogusky shook his head and laughed  clearly amused at that cop out  Then he went on to teach the crowd how to massage and salt the fruits of their labors  In their fervor some people added shredded carrots to their mixtures  too Melanie Carroll  a 39 year old veggie lover from Boston  brimmed with questions  “Do I need to put a liquid in there  Am I just mashing it all in  Did I put in enough salt ” she asked while squeezing the moisture out of her big bowl of chopped brassica  members of the brassica family include cabbage  as well as cauliflower  brussels sprouts and broccoli  Then Ogusky directed them to pack the veggies into the jars where they would soon begin their natural and wild transformations The 65 year old Northeastern professor came back with a big  “Wow  No preservatives ”Hashemi can be counted among the kraut mob organizer’s recent kraut converts — and converts are just what Ogusky will be targeting at Sunday’s Fermentation Festival  His goal is to expose as many newbies as possible to the wide world of fermented foods  including kombucha  pickles  chocolate and beer  But for Ogusky  sauerkraut is the perfect  gateway drug  into the growing fermentation movement The complex  sour flavors you taste in fermented foods are created by lactic acid bacteria  Ogusky — a longtime potter — started fermenting six years ago  That s also when he started making fermentation vessels  Demand for these crocks has grown in line with the fermentation trend  Now  Ogusky even sells them to the mainstream cooking retailer Williams Sonoma In his Jamaica Plain studio he poured liquid clay into molds as he explained how he came up with the kraut mob idea and his concept for fermentation dinners at local restaurants  including Journeyman in Somerville’s Union Square Fermented foods are also called  living foods   and interest in them is surging as more new research emerges about the important role microbes play in our bodies  health Sandor Katz  author of The New York Times best selling book  “The Art of Fermentation ” has been teaching people how to make sauerkraut for 20 years and is something of a godfather to the living food movement  But even with the steady stream of new research he told me a lot of people are still scared of bacteria Katz s assurances are based on science and experience  USDA microbiologist and fermented foods specialist Fred Breidt also told me how he would answer that question Easing people’s fears will be part of Tufts University microbiologist Ben Wolfe’s job in the Boston Fermentation Festival’s “Science Corner ”But Wolfe believes using food as the translator can cause epiphanies Kraut mob organizer Ogusky acknowledges the fact that letting veggies sit in an un sealed vessel — on a shelf  bubbling away for months — can seem creepy  But it s also provocative That s the pitch Ogusky will make Sunday to what he predicts will be the largest crowd to populate one of his kraut mobs  He s got more than 250 pounds of cabbage waiting to be chopped  massaged  salted  squished into jars before being invaded by armies of hungry microbes The Boston Fermentation Festival is held Sunday  Oct  4 at the Boston Public Market from 10 a m  until 4 p m This segment aired on October 4  2015

325,Leonard Nimoy  the actor known and loved by generations of  Star Trek  fans as the pointy eared  purely logical science officer Mr  Spock  has died Nimoy s son  Adam Nimoy  said the actor died Friday of end stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at his Los Angeles home  He was 83 Although Leonard Nimoy followed his 1966 69  Star Trek  run with a notable career as both an actor and director  in the public s mind he would always be Spock  His half human  half Vulcan character was the calm counterpoint to William Shatner s often emotional Captain Kirk on one of television and film s most revered cult series Nimoy s ambivalence to the role was reflected in the titles of his two autobiographies   I Am Not Spock   1975  and  I Am Spock   1995  After  Star Trek  ended  the actor immediately joined the hit adventure series  Mission Impossible  as Paris  the mission team s master of disguises  From 1976 to 1982 he hosted the syndicated TV series  In Search of       which attempted to probe such mysteries as the legend of the Loch Ness Monster and the disappearance of aviator Amelia Earhart He played Israeli leader Golda Meir s husband opposite Ingrid Bergman in the TV drama  A Woman Called Golda  and Vincent van Gogh in  Vincent   a one man stage show on the life of the troubled painter  He continued to work well into his 70s  playing gazillionaire genius William Bell in the Fox series  Fringe  He also directed several films  including the hit comedy  Three Men and a Baby  and appeared in such plays as  A Streetcar Named Desire    Cat on a Hot Tin Roof    Fiddler on the Roof    The King and I    My Fair Lady  and  Equus   He also published books of poems  children s stories and his own photographs But he could never really escape the role that took him overnight from bit part actor status to TV star  and in a 1995 interview he sought to analyze the popularity of Spock  the green blooded space traveler who aspired to live a life based on pure logic People identified with Spock because they  recognize in themselves this wish that they could be logical and avoid the pain of anger and confrontation   Nimoy concluded In the years immediately after  Star Trek  left television  Nimoy tried to shun the role  but he eventually came to embrace it  lampooning himself on such TV shows as  Futurama    Duckman  and  The Simpsons  and in commercials He became Spock after  Star Trek  creator Gene Roddenberry was impressed by his work in guest appearances on the TV shows  The Lieutenant  and  Dr  Kildare  The space adventure set in the 23rd century had an unimpressive debut on NBC on Sept  8  1966  and it struggled during its three seasons to find an audience other than teenage boys  It seemed headed for oblivion after it was canceled in 1969  but its dedicated legion of fans  who called themselves Trekkies  kept its memory alive with conventions and fan clubs and constant demands that the cast be reassembled for a movie or another TV show Trekkies were particularly fond of Spock  often greeting one another with the Vulcan salute and the Vulcan motto   Live Long and Prosper   both of which Nimoy was credited with bringing to the character  He pointed out  however  that the hand gesture was actually derived from one used by rabbis during Hebraic benedictions When the cast finally was reassembled for  Star Trek   The Motion Picture   in 1979  the film was a huge hit and five sequels followed  Nimoy appeared in all of them and directed two  He also guest starred as an older version of himself in some of the episodes of the show s spinoff TV series   Star Trek  The Next Generation  In 2009  he was back in a new big screen version of  Star Trek   this time playing an older Spock who meets his younger self  played by Zachary Quinto  Critic Roger Ebert called the older Spock  the most human character in the film  Among those seeing the film was President Barack Obama  whose even manner was often likened to Spock s Upon the movie s debut  Nimoy told The Associated Press that in his late 70s he was probably closer than ever to being as comfortable with himself as the logical Spock always appeared to be Born in Boston to Jewish immigrants from Russia  Nimoy was raised in an Italian section of the city where  although he counted many Italian Americans as his friends  he said he also felt the sting of anti Semitism growing up At age 17 he was cast in a local production of Clifford Odets   Awake and Sing  as the son in a Jewish family He won a drama scholarship to Boston College but eventually dropped out  moved to California and took acting lessons at the Pasadena Playhouse Soon he had lost his  Boston dead end  accent  hired an agent and began getting small roles in TV series and movies  He played a baseball player in  Rhubarb  and an Indian in  Old Overland Trail  After service in the Army  he returned to Hollywood  working as taxi driver  vacuum cleaner salesman  movie theater usher and other jobs while looking for acting roles In 1954 he married Sandra Zober  a fellow student at the Pasadena Playhouse  and they had two children  Julie and Adam  The couple divorced  and in 1988 he married Susan Bay  a film production executive This story contains biographical material compiled by late AP Entertainment Writer Bob Thomas

364,A white man who joined a prayer meeting inside a historic black church and then fatally shot nine people was captured without resistance Thursday after an all night manhunt  Charleston s police chief said Dylann Storm Roof  21  spent nearly an hour inside the church Wednesday night before killing six women and three men  including the pastor  Chief Greg Mullen said  A citizen spotted his car in Shelby  North Carolina  nearly four hours away The chief wouldn t discuss a motive  Charleston Mayor Joseph P  Riley Jr  called it  pure  pure concentrated evil   Stunned community leaders and politicians condemned the attack on The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church  and Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the Justice Department has begun a hate crime investigation President Barack Obama  who personally knew the slain pastor  state Sen  Clementa Pinckney  said these shootings have to stop Pinckney  41  was a married father of two who spent 19 years in the South Carolina legislature  He became the youngest member of the House when he was first elected as a Democrat at 23 The other victims were identified as Cynthia Hurd  54  Tywanza Sanders  26  the Rev  Sharonda Singleton  45  Myra Thompson  59  Ethel Lance  70  Susie Jackson  87  the Rev  Daniel Simmons Sr   74  and DePayne Doctor  49 The shootings took out the heart of a community — civic leaders including three pastors  a regional library manager  a college enrollment counselor  and a high school track coach — and left the historic church with just one living minister Wooten said autopsies would be conducted over the next several days and did not have specific information on how many times the victims were shot or the locations of their injuries Roof waived extradition from North Carolina Thursday and was taken to a waiting police car wearing a bulletproof vest  with shackles on his feet and his hands cuffed behind his back Roof s childhood friend  Joey Meek  alerted the FBI after recognizing him in a surveillance camera image  They recognized the stained sweatshirt he had been wearing while playing Xbox videogames in their home But Roof had been to jail  court records show a pending felony drug case and a past misdemeanor trespassing charge  And he proudly displayed the flags of defeated white ruled regimes  posing with a Confederate flags plate on his car and wearing a jacket with stitched on flag patches from Rhodesia  which is now black led Zimbabwe  and apartheid era South Africa Meek said they had been best friends in middle school  then lost touch for years until Roof reappeared a few weeks ago Roof wasn t known to the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery  Alabama  and it s not clear whether he had any connection to the 16 white supremacist organizations operating in South Carolina  but he appears to be a  disaffected white supremacist   based on his Facebook page  said the center s president  Richard Cohen Charleston authorities put out photos of the suspect from the church s surveillance camera early Thursday  Later that morning  authorities west of Charlotte  North Carolina  got a report of a sighting of the suspect s car headed west  said Jeff Ledford  the police chief in Shelby  North Carolina  Officers pulled over the driver and arrested Roof just before 11 a m   about 14 hours after the attack A gun was found in the car  Mullen said The shooting evoked painful memories of other attacks  Black churches were bombed in the 1960s when they served as organizing hubs for the Civil Rights movement  and burned by arsons across the South in the 1990s  Others survived shooting sprees This particular congregation  which formed in 1816  has its own grim history  A founder  Denmark Vesey  was hanged after trying to organize a slave revolt in 1822  and white landowners burned the church in revenge  leaving parishioners to worship underground until after the Civil War This shooting  should be a warning to us all that we do have a problem in our society   said state Rep  Wendell Gilliard  a Democrat whose district includes the church   There s a race problem in our country  There s a gun problem in our country  We need to act on them quickly  NAACP President and CEO Cornell William Brooks said  there is no greater coward than a criminal who enters a house of God and slaughters innocent people  A few bouquets of flowers tied to a police barricade outside the church formed a small but growing memorial The attack came two months after the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man  Walter Scott  by a white police officer in neighboring North Charleston  which increased racial tensions  The officer awaits trial for murder  and the shooting prompted South Carolina to pass a law  co sponsored by Pinckney  to equip police statewide with body cameras Contributors include Alex Sanz  Meg Kinnard and David Goldman in Charleston  South Carolina  Jay Reeves in Birmingham  Alabama  Eric Tucker in

395,The Republican Party has a problem  It has too many candidates for president  somewhere between 15 and 20 One of the usual ways to winnow the field has been by televised debates  But the sheer number of candidates makes that virtually impossible  Debate hosts Fox News and CNN have decided to use national polls to cull the debate herd to the top 10 candidates Here’s The Rub What if Candidate A is getting 7 percent in the polls  and the cutoff for inclusion is 7 points  If Candidate B is at 6 percent or even 6 5 percent  he or she misses the cut  With a crowded field  such a scenario is quite likely  What if Candidate D has broad name recognition but has very little chance of becoming the party’s nominee   I’m thinking of Donald Trump  Only White Men Allowed As Stuart Rothenberg pointed out in Roll Call  a poll determined culling could result in excluding the only female candidate  former CEO Carly Fiorina  the only African American  retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson  and the only other nonwhite politician  Louisiana Gov  Bobby Jindal  They have low name recognition and would have to run a national TV advertising campaign before the first debate  currently set by Fox for Aug  6 March Madness In March of every year  the NCAA runs a college basketball tournament that begins with a field of 64 teams chosen by a mix of national polls  winners of several leagues and favorites  Seeding usually involves pitting the Usual Suspects  such as Duke  North Carolina  Kentucky  a Big Ten team and a west coast team  against one another toward the end of the tournament  In about a month  using a system of one on one matchups arranged in brackets  the field is narrowed to a final four  and then two teams emerge and play for the national championship in a hopelessly hyped drama that usually rewards one of the heavily favored teams  but not always Let’s Play Jeopardy The only television game show you wouldn’t be embarrassed to be caught watching — “Jeopardy ” — provides a model  Contestants who win the most money and games against a changing field of two opponents return for what the show calls its Tournament of Champions  The contenders engage in a round robin style playoff  where they compete against two other champions  and if successful  face another two champions  etc  until the final two face off for all the marbles — or in this case $250 000 How Debates Could Work For the first night  based on a random drawing  four GOP candidates would be selected to meet on stage  Let’s say it’s a group consisting of Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker  former Texas Gov  Rick Perry  former New York Gov  George Pataki and U S  Sen  Lindsey Graham  The usual debate format would apply  candidates answering questions asked by a panel of interrogators  it doesn’t have to be reporters  as long as they aren’t petrified by being on camera   There can be some candidate to candidate questions  rebuttals and other devices to get the candidates out of reciting pat answers that they’ve rehearsed  There would be no live audience Later that evening  a polling company selected by the party would ask 300 or so Republican voters  activists and insiders to decide who won the debate  The winner of that poll would wait until the next foursome goes through a similar debate  with questions that would be different or the same  A second winner would be determined by the same polling firm and so on through the third and fourth lineup of until we reach a final four  Those finalists would do one more debate to allow the party faithful to see the early winners in action  That big winner would be determined by the usual methods — analysis by pundits or a televised focus group    instead of a national poll Sure  this isn’t perfect  some candidates are better than others at giving good soundbites or humorous answers  a candidate in an early round could have a bad night or a good night  and some questions might be unfair to certain candidates  The Law of Unintended Consequences might come into play   But everyone would participate making it superior to the exclusionary arrangement based on polling that is little more than a measurement of name recognition It’s not often I give advice to the Republicans  but there could come a time when Democrats could be stuck with its own field of dreamers Dan Payne is a Democratic political analyst for WBUR and a contributor to The Boston Globe

about some day  But he’s always been a braggart  that’s part of his celebrity appeal  Last year  when he spoke as a non candidate at the National Press Club  a reporter noted that he was supposed to talk about branding  but mostly talked about himself … with eight different boasts 2   Thou Shalt Not Speak Above A Fourth Grade VocabularyA linguistic analysis determined that Trump spoke at a 3rd  or 4th grade level  Politico reported Flattening the English language whenever he speaks without a script  Trump relies heavily on words such as “very” and “great ” and the pronouns “we” and “I ” which is his favorite word  As any news observer can observe  he lives to diminish his foes by calling them “losers ” “total losers ” “haters ” “dumb ” “idiots ” “morons ” “stupid ” “dummy” and “disgusting ”3  Thou Shalt Make Promises So Huuuuge And Vague People Cannot Doubt Thy BoldnessTrump’s slogan is to “make America great again ” He’s pledged to build a classy wall at the border and make Mexico pay for it  He says he’ll deport 11 million “illegal immigrants” so fast “it’ll make your head spin ” He promises to find a General Douglas MacArthur who will rebuild the military so “everyone” will respect the U S  again When asked how he’d get Mexico to pay for the wall  or how he’d round up and deport so many people  and at what cost  his answer is just to reiterate that he will do it all easily and quickly  Not only has his “vague is beautiful” style not hindered him  he went along with Jimmy Fallon’s mockery of him on his preposterous promises in a skit that helped him win the “Tonight Show” audience 4  Thou Shalt Never Apologize  But When Expedient  Just Explain That Offensive Remarks Were MisunderstoodTrump has insulted Mexican immigrants  Sen  John McCain  conservative talk show hosts  and in each case  it was widely thought that Trump would have to express regret at “inappropriate” remarks  But no  he continued to rise in the polls after each supposed gaffe  More recently  it was thought he crossed the line again when he was quoted in “Rolling Stone” denigrating rival candidate Carly Fiorina  “Look at that face  Would anyone vote for that ” But instead of apologizing  he denied talking about her face  and claimed he was talking about her “persona ” That inspired this headline on a New Yorker magazine article  “Donald’s Trump nose is growing longer and longer ” Yet he continued to surge in polls 5 Thou Shalt Worship Repetition  For It Is The Essence Of BrandingTrump has been hailed by some in the media for selling himself like a product — saying he’s a “genius” at branding  Repetition is a big part of that  He’ll say over and over and over that Jeb Bush is “low energy ” for instance  and people can’t look at Bush without wondering about his energy A woman who supports Trump explained in a focus group “We know his goal is to make America great again  It s on his hat  And we see it every time it s on TV  Everything that he s doing  there s no doubt why he s doing it  It s to make America great again  6  Thou Shalt Exalt Personality Over Principle And PolicyIn the conservative The Federalist  Robert Tracinski wrote that a “cult of personality” explains the Trump phenomenon “After Donald Trump’s bombastic performance in last week’s debate  it’s clear that the key to his appeal is not his policy positions  which are all over the map  No  it’s all about his personality  and the paradox is that the more unpleasant his personality is revealed to be  the greater his appeal to his core group of supporters ”7  Thou Shalt Respect Power Of Insults For They Shall Slay Your Enemies  Entertain The MassesTrump is an insult machine  For a sample  you can view “Top 20 Trump Insults” on YouTube  Or you can just wait for his next interview 8 Thou Shalt Never Pass Up Opportunity To Attack A Media Doubter For They Shall Be IntimidatedIn the 2012 presidential race  Newt Gingrich was thought to have won a debate — and the South Carolina primary right after — because he indignantly criticized CNN anchor John King for opening the debate by asking him about remarks from his ex wife  But Trump has gone much further  criticizing even popular conservative talk show hosts like Megyn Kelly and Hugh Hewitt without suffering in the polls Trump’s eagerness to blame the media for any controversy was apparent when he attacked both hosts of NBC’s Today Show  Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie  after his disparagement of McCain’s military service  Sounding not just defensive  but paranoid  he told Lauer  “So you misrepresent — like everybody else ”9  Honour Thy Trolling And Tweeting To Know The Sweet Joy Of Mocking The MeekTrump has millions of followers on Twitter  and he tweets throughout the day  His comments are treated like press releases by many in the media  enabling him to trigger news coverage at will  and dominate a news cycle  He knows the secrets of generating publicity  knock an opponent  comment on something in the news  or just say something wacky  Such statements  in 140 characters or less  are all considered quote worthy  no matter how simple minded 10  Remember The Days Of Whining Lead To WinningOne Trump comment illustrates how he can get away with saying foolish  “entertaining” he’d say  things that would probably have caused a presidential candidacy to implode back in the day “I am a whiner  and I keep whining and whining until I win ”That “boast” may seem immature   or to use a Trumpian word  dumb  But Trump supporters would consider it refreshingly candid and authentic Sadly  it’s hard to argue with Trump’s claim  After all  he has been whining and winning Maybe that will change in Wednesday’s GOP presidential debate  But if Trump does poorly  there’s one person he won’t blame for it  Donald Trump After all  thou shalt not take the name of the Donald in vain  right Trump Todd Domke is a Republican political analyst for WBUR

406,A disgusted Gov  Charlie Baker blasted Republican presidential contender Donald Trump on Monday evening over the candidate s proposal to bar all Muslims from entering the country  calling the idea  ridiculous  and antithetical to the  values that people in this country hold most dear  Baker  speaking to reporters after helping to celebrate Hanukkah and light a menorah at the State House  grew increasingly animated as he learned exactly what Trump had said in a statement proposing a ban on all Muslims  including tourists and American Muslims living abroad  until  our country s representatives can figure out what s going on  Asked whether he thought Trump was simply trying to get attention  Baker said   I have no idea what the motivation is on that but first of all it s unrealistic  secondly it s inappropriate and third it doesn t make any sense  Trump  in his statement  cited research from the Pew Research Center and others that he said showed  great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population  After giving his initial reaction  Baker asked to read a copy of the full statement released by the Trump campaign  As he finished reading  the governor flicked the paper forcefully and returned to the group of reporters to expound on what he thought Baker noted that he had just celebrated the  miracle of Hanukkah  to commemorate the fight of the people of Jerusalem for religious freedom  That celebration took place in the State House  which he described as a mile from the Warren Tavern in Charlestown where  the patriots of this nation  held early conversations about securing freedom from the British crown  He said the earliest settlers  in fact  had come to America for the chance to practice their religion freely

430,Before Labor Day signals the beginning of more serious political analysis  let’s review how comedians have been treating the 2016 presidential candidates This is how I think professional comedians would rank the contenders in terms of how much material they are providing  along with samples of what comics have said about them Donald TrumpHe is not just the GOP frontrunner  he’s got to be the favorite among comedians for lampooning  While many voters view The Donald as narcissistic  megalomaniacal  boastful and bigoted  he is unarguably a great gift to late night comedy Joe BidenComedians must be praying that the vice president will enter the race  He’s called a gaffe machine  but he must be encouraged by how Trump has risen in the polls despite saying equally outrageous things  Biden also is mocked for massaging  groping   women  like with Stephanie Carter  the wife of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter   when her husband was having a press conference Chris ChristieIt’s not nice to make fun of someone’s appearance  but comedians can’t resist the temptation with the larger than life governor of New Jersey  Christie apparently doesn’t hold it against them  he even shared a bowl of ice cream with Jimmy Fallon on  The Tonight Show  Hillary ClintonThe Democratic frontrunner is a favorite target for comedians  likewise her husband  the former president  She is often ridiculed for being an overly shrewd politician Jeb BushThe former Florida governor has “Jeb ” as his only name in campaign materials  but that doesn’t stop comics from mocking his famous last name Lindsey GrahamThe Republican senator from South Carolina hasn’t made much progress in the polls    he’s averaging less than 1 percent support — but some comedians like to mock the only bachelor in the race  Jon Stewart  before leaving “The Daily Show ” mimicked him  sounding like a southern belle Rick PerryThe former GOP governor of Texas had his “oops” moment in a 2012 debate  but tried to project a new image this time — wearing glasses  for a more studious look  But it hasn’t changed the way comedians talk about him Bernie SandersThe Vermont senator has become a serious threat to Hillary Clinton  so the early mocking of him as a certain loser has evolved into jokes about his occasionally wild hair  his lack of support from black voters  and his being an old hippie socialist from Vermont Ted CruzThe conservative Texas senator was widely mocked when he was the first GOP candidate to announce  but with Trump eclipsing him  comedians don’t mention him as often Rand PaulThe Republican senator from Kentucky surged in the polls early  as a libertarian he stood to inherit supporters of his father  Rep  Ron Paul  who ran for president a number of times  But in interviews young Paul often showed a testy side  and his popularity went down Martin O’Malley  Rick Santorum  Bobby Jindal  Lincoln Chafee  et al Candidates floundering in the polls are often mocked as sure losers and maybe a bit delusional Todd Domke is a Republican political analyst for WBUR

435,It’s a question that seems timely now  given that he’s declined from a high of around 30 percent in polls to 23 percent in the latest USA Today survey of likely Republican voters No presidential candidate has ever bragged so much about his polling numbers  Indeed  he talks about his popularity as if it were the ultimate argument for why he should be president  In his mind  maybe it’s just a branding strategy  If he keeps selling how popular he is  people might view him as inevitable and hop onto the Trump bandwagon  Or maybe he thinks polls are the equivalent of high ratings for a TV reality show His bandwagon slowed to a standstill when he performed poorly in the last televised debate  He worked in insults about rivals  but was put in his place    as bullies often are    by opponents who stood up to him  Carly Fiorina  Marco Rubio and others showed they could be just as strong and confident as Trump  but more knowledgeable and persuasive Then Trump’s bandwagon started to go backward when he tried to maintain his dominance in the GOP field by getting more specific about issues  He started turning off some Republicans when it became clear that he wasn’t as conservative or populist as they had hoped  He favored ending taxation on the poor  He favored allowing Russia to take over Syria  And he favored universal health care  going far beyond ObamaCare At the same time  he indicated that he wanted to project a kinder  gentler image  That seemed like a predictable shift in strategy since polls showed that of all the GOP candidates he had the worst approval disapproval ratio — negative 25 points But he couldn’t suddenly stop insulting opponents who were rising in the polls  they did threaten his frontrunner status  So he veered back and forth between trying to present a new Trump    talking about his wife and children    but still acting like the old Trump in retweeting praise about himself  mocking opponents  and whining about “unfair” media coverage Trump has proven to be a surprisingly cagey politician  while pretending to be a non politician  He repeats the same old soundbites  promotes himself tirelessly  flatters supporters  manipulates many in the media  never admits being wrong  and appeals to the resentments of his base So if Trump falls in the polls and  decides to drop out if the trend seems irreversible  it probably won’t be because of a terrible gaffe or flash of un presidential temper  He is disciplined enough  and shrewd enough  not to self destruct that way  And most of his followers seem so loyal to him    dismissing any criticism with an “I don’t care” response    that he probably can keep a base of 10 20 percent regardless of any blunder The collapse of his support could happen for a different reason  He’s got several rivals who personify different parts of Trump’s appeal Fiorina  who has risen in polls from zero to 13 percent  appeals to some Trump supporters who admire a no nonsense business executive who isn’t afraid to say  “You’re fired ”Ted Cruz has been cultivating Trump supporters by sounding like a more articulate demagogue on divisive issues like immigration Ben Carson is the opposite of Trump personality wise    he’s soft spoken and humble    but he appeals to Tea Party activists and evangelicals who comprise a big part of Trump’s base Rubio isn’t as much of a political outsider as the aforementioned candidates  but with foreign affairs and military policy becoming more important in debate and news coverage  he outshines Trump in making the case that the U S  must be stronger and more respected in the world As these candidates get better known and draw supporters away from Trump  the proud billionaire will be watching the polls carefully for a new reason    not to bask in the glory of his popularity  but to figure out if and when he should bail out  After all  he doesn’t want to risk being called that most dreaded word in Trump’s vocabulary  loser Todd Domke is a Republican political analyst for WBUR

447,The price was too steep for the Boston Celtics to trade for a better draft pick  Now it will be an uphill climb for all four of their choices to make the team Especially at the guard position The Celtics added three players   Terry Rozier of Louisville  R J  Hunter of Georgia State and Marcus Thornton of William  amp  Mary   to an already full backcourt  They did add to a position of need by taking shot blocking forward Jordan Mickey of Louisiana State But coach Brad Stevens figures so many guards will help the top ones develop their own games rather than measure themselves against each other Ainge had plenty of draft picks to include in a trade  four this year and a potential 21 through 2018  including a possible 10 first rounders  But he likely would have had to include a veteran or two and felt a deal wasn t worth the uncertainty of how a better draft pick would develop if the Celtics did move up What is accurate is that the Celtics will have some stiff competition at guard with the three newcomers joining holdovers Isaiah Thomas  Avery Bradley  Marcus Smart  Evan Turner and Phil Pressey Ainge raved about the athleticism and competitiveness of the 6 foot 1 Rozier  who averaged 17 1 points as a sophomore last season The 6 foot 6 Hunter averaged 19 7 points as a junior last season and hit 39 5 percent of his three point attempts  For his college career  he averaged 18 4 points Boston chose Rozier with the 16th pick and Hunter with the 28th  In the second round  they added Mickey with the 33rd choice and Thornton with the 45th Hunter is known for his 3 point basket with 2 7 seconds left that gave No  14 Georgia State a 57 56 win over No  3 Baylor in this year s NCAA Tournament  His coach and father  Ron Hunter  fell from his stool during the play while coaching with an Achilles tendon injury Rozier moved to point guard late in the season after Chris Jones was dismissed from Louisville s team  Rozier helped the Cardinals to the Elite Eight  where they lost in overtime to Michigan State He s not troubled by competing with so many guards But first he had an unusual celebration after being drafted The Celtics had been expected to go for a frontcourt player and 6 foot 11 Bobby Portis of Arkansas was available  He s a good outside shooter but wouldn t provide the defensive presence inside that the Celtics lack They got that later in Mickey  who led the nation with 3 64 blocked shots per game The Celtics missed out on the draft lottery when they finished with a surprising 40 42 record and got the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference  They were swept 4 0 in the opening playoff round by the Cleveland Cavaliers They needed help to win more and the draft is just the start

453,As Vice President Joe Biden weighs whether to enter the 2016 presidential race  WBUR s Democratic political analyst Dan Payne breaks down what will happen if he does  He will not win  He may be enjoying popularity right now  but he’s living in a national sympathy cocoon  ever since Maureen Dowd wrote in The New York Times that his dying son’s last wish was for his father to run  In the Washington  D C  echo chamber it seems “everyone” loves him  Once he becomes a candidate  he will be just another politician  available for criticism and ridicule  This will be his third try for the presidency  he knows what he’s in for He will be attacked  Not right away  but sooner than he’d like  he’ll be roughed up by Republicans  the news media  and his Democratic rivals  He will be in an attack free zone for a few weeks  then he will be a target just like every other candidate  His legacy  such as it is  and new found halo will disappear His rationale will be troublesome  As Bill Scher wrote in Real Clear Politics  Biden s message amounts to  “I want the job and Hillary Clinton is in the way ” He has said nothing to convince the Clintons that his contemplation is not related to Hillary’s sagging poll numbers  What’s his case against her He will have to defend the Obama Administration  not just the things he worked on  He will have to defend everything that President Obama has said and done  He will be the surrogate for Obama and that will make him a fetching target as opponents and reporters seek out differences with the boss  For example  what will he say about the Trans Pacific Partnership or the threat from ISIS He will get hurt by history  He will have to relive his 1988 presidential campaign in which he was forced to quit because it was discovered that he stole the biography of British politician Neil Kinnock and called it his own He will again commit gaffes  He seems to have no edit button for his mouth  a quality now being lauded as candid and authentic  This will lead him to say whatever comes to mind    as vice president  on the campaign trail  on network news  to local reporters  and potentially most damaging  in debates He won’t be able to skip Iowa and New Hampshire  Not only are they testing grounds  but they will generate the lion’s share of political news  Candidates who have tried end runs around early primaries discover that voters in later states are not waiting for them  He’s way behind in organizing in Iowa  New Hampshire  South Carolina  Nevada and elsewhere He will learn that this election is not about him  it’s about us  People will take pity on him and admire his spunk but eventually he will be expected to say why his election will be good for the country  not just his spirits  A campaign is not grief therapy  it’s a real world contest of ideas  Even Donald Trump offers ideas  no matter how nutty they are He may not be able to raise enough money  The pledges of financial support he or his backers are getting today are not permanent  Ask Rick Perry and Scott Walker  Biden’s biggest deficit is the time he’s already lost  Right now  the only people he hears from   and this is true for every presidential candidate   are those who for various reasons want him to run  They will fade into the wood work if his poll numbers start to slide He will not recognize modern presidential campaigns with 24 hour news cycles  social media sniping  superPACs  vicious critics on the radio and blogs  and issues he may not want to discuss  such as opioid addiction  Black Lives Matter protests  Planned Parenthood  ISIS  Trumpian attacks on illegal immigrants  crime  gun control  etc His candidacy will light a fire under Hillary  She and her supporters will see  or argue  his late entry as an attack on a woman presidential candidate  He will pay a price with female political activists and organizations  Right now  he’s seen as harmless Uncle Joe struggling with grief  Soon  he could become a man who felt he could dislodge a woman who can’t explain her emails His penchant for windbaggery will not disappear  Before his son’s death  he was routinely satirized by  Saturday Night Live  and comedians as someone who talks endlessly  At the 2014 St  Patrick’s Day breakfast in Boston  which he called into  he droned on so long that Rep  Steve Lynch wisecracked when Biden finally hung up  “I hope he didn’t call collect ”He will learn the Democratic party has changed  He’s the toast of the Morning Joe and Chris Matthews TV shows  and is highly sought after to speak before various Irish groups  But Irish Catholics  labor union rank and file  Jews  and traditional ethnic elements of the Democratic coalition are not a reliable block of votes in 2015 to be delivered to an Irish Catholic Democrat with working class roots  Today’s Democratic party is female  professional  black and Hispanic Dan Payne is a Democratic political analyst for WBUR and a regular contributor to the Boston Globe
454,For years  teaching self defense has been considered a controversial way to prevent sexual assault on college campuses  with some critics saying it s a form of blaming the victim  Instead  the focus has been on teaching students what constitutes sexual assault  and teaching students how to intervene when they think a person might be assaulted But some Harvard students believe that s not enough  and they ve decided to learn how to protect themselves Self Defense ClassIn a grand house off Harvard Square  which we are not allowed to identify  the students  a group of women  have gathered in a shabby  oak paneled room to learn how to protect themselves Serena  a Harvard junior  wants only her first name used because the others want to remain anonymous  She took the class last year and brought back friends The mother of one of the women paid for the class Part of the instruction is in physical self defense  Meg Stone  the instructor  teaches the women to get into a stable stance — feet wide apart  shoulders back  hands up like stop signs — when they feel threatened The women laugh at how startled they are by Stone s yell  and they applaud her For three hours  Stone teaches the women verbal and physical ways to deter aggressors on the street  in the subway  at parties in rooms like this one and in dorm rooms  She holds up a huge helmet to train the women how to jab at the eyes of an attacker  She teaches each woman to assess who is a threat and how to escalate her verbal responses in a dangerous situation There is pushback on college campuses against teaching women self defense  because it s seen as a way of blaming victims  Critics believe the emphasis should be on teaching men not to assault Serena says it cannot be either or Stone has each woman practice getting out of a situation she does not want to be in after a man has brought her to a male dominated space  say  his room Stone also coaches each woman to put a male friend on notice after he s tried to have sex with a female friend against her will After class  the women reflect on what they ve gotten out of it  One student says she learned that she need not do anything she does not want to do Instructor Stone is frustrated that colleges and universities don t see the potential for classes such as this one  She s taught it at 35 high schools and just as many community groups and businesses But besides this session at Harvard  she s only taught classes at three other colleges  She s also been booked for a class at MIT  Emerson College and Boston College also offer self defense for women  but not with scenarios for sexual assault This article was originally published on April 08  2015 This segment aired on April 8  2015 
455,In Tuesday night s Democratic presidential debate on CNN  Hillary Clinton was so confident  relaxed and well prepared she not only defeated her four opponents on the stage but she also sent a warning shot to absent Vice President Joe Biden Her unstated message was   Give it a rest  Joe  There’s no room for you in this race   Debates matter in presidential politics — ask Donald Trump  Carly Fiorina  and Ben Carson — and skipping one  especially this first one  in Las Vegas   is like folding your hand in a poker game without looking at your cards  Perhaps Biden will be turned on by what he saw — and you can bet he watched — but he’s been in politics long enough to know the game is being played at a table where he’s not sitting  If he keeps stalling  he’ll have no chance to have a respectable showing  much less win the Democratic nomination Bernie Sanders was his usual bombastic  hyperbolic self  attacking Wall Street  big banks and billionaires at every turn  It’s as though all ills in society can be addressed by taxing or emasculating the rich and powerful  When asked how he’ll accomplish his goals  his answer is almost always by millions of Americans marching  protesting and demanding fundamental change  This complicates Sanders’ cause  Most people don’t want to have to demonstrate to bring about political change  voting is about as far as they’re willing to go — and turnout suggests damn few of them are willing to do that  Sanders is saying that  to rein in the billionaire class  people must become politically active at federal  state and local levels  Perhaps they will  but as one of his opponents said  there won’t be any revolution in America  Sanders’ lack of pre debate preparation sessions    he didn’t do mock debates  a sine qua non for any serious candidate   showed when he was unable to answer Clinton on his votes against the Brady bill five times and in favor of immunity for gun sellers and gun makers  Clinton got a break when Sanders said to her that he was  sick and tired of your damn emails   Only her defense of Planned Parenthood got louder  longer applause Hillary Clinton’s debate experience  she s participated in about 25  showed  she was calm  cool and collected  She was in command of the facts and her arguments  At the risk of seeming sexist  I think she also looked good  She knew how to react when others were talking  mainly smiling and nodding her assent but occasionally looking like she disagreed but without grimacing or looking angry  She wisely decided to point out the differences between Democrats and Republicans  previewing her general election arguments  faulting the GOP on war  taxes  Social Security and Medicare  Her complaint about Republicans wanting to de fund Planned Parenthood drew thunderous applause Clinton was so obviously the winner last night that on camera analysts proclaimed her victory almost immediately after the debate ended  David Axelrod  a longtime adviser to President Obama  used the word “fluid” to describe her performance  Paul Begala  a longtime adviser to President Bill Clinton  said it was probably her best debate performance ever  Politico’s panel of political professionals gave it to Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly  79 percent of Democratic analysts said she won  54 percent of Republicans did Muhammed Ali  before one of his epic boxing matches against George Forman  proclaimed that he’d “float like a butterfly and sting like a bee ” That describes what Hillary Clinton did last night For the other three candidates  it was open mic night and they bombed  Lincoln Chaffee  a former Rhode Island senator and governor  appeared like the old time comedian Dr  Irwin Corey  confused and confusing  He should drop out of the race  Soon  Ditto for Jim Webb  a former senator from Virginia and former secretary of the Navy  he should run in the Republican primaries  He took conservative positions on guns  taxes and energy  agreeing at one point that he’s pro coal and pro nuclear power  Asked to name his enemy  he oddly recalled the soldier who tried to kill him in Vietnam but is dead now Martin O Malley  former Maryland governor and Baltimore mayor  had the most to gain but stumbled periodically and didn’t sustain a line of reasoning or attack  Clinton stung him when she recalled that he had endorsed her in 2004  O’Malley argued that all the things that his opponents said they’d do as president  he’d already done as governor  He wasn’t flaky  but Sanders’ strength has all but pushed him off the stage Anderson Cooper  CNN host and chief interrogator  did his best imitation of his colleague  the pugilistic Jake Tapper  Cooper was tough  especially on Clinton  right from the start  going after her for changing her position on gay marriage and most recently on the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal  She slipped the noose on that one  but she should expect more rough treatment in the coming weeks and at subsequent debates  Five more are scheduled As the late Yogi Berra said  “It ain’t over till it’s over ” but it’s much closer to being over after last night Dan Payne is a Democratic political analyst for WBUR and a regular contributor to The Boston Globe 
456,It’s commonly understood that Hillary Clinton and her allies must be happy to see so many Republicans running for president  They assume that the GOP primary contest will become a demolition derby  Plus  they figure there’ll be less media scrutiny and criticism of Hillary if the spotlight is on the Republicans But it’s safe to say  too  that Hillary and her strategists also hope that three to four Democrats will compete with her for the party’s presidential nomination  not just one If several challengers split the unhappy with Hillary vote  it would be hard for any of them to quickly emerge as the clear alternative  The choice as framed by the media would be  expected winner vs  a bunch of unknown  unexciting  underfunded white guys So Hillary must be privately rooting for all four of the Democrats considering a run  Vermont Sen  Bernie Sanders  former Maryland Gov  Martin O’Malley  former Rhode Island Sen  Lincoln Chafee and former Virginia Sen  Jim Webb Lincoln Davenport Chafee declared “I’m running” on CNN  but his spokesperson later clarified that he is still officially exploring and would announce later  When  Chafee said  “I’ll come up with some kind of date at the appropriate time ” Wow  that kind of decisiveness must have the Hillary campaign all the more eager for him to enter the race In his TV interview  Chafee criticized Clinton on foreign policy  He contended that as secretary of state she botched U S  relations with Russia  and he reminded viewers that as a senator she voted to authorize military force in Iraq  Hillary is a hawk in the view of many antiwar Democrats  and she learned in her 2008 nomination battle with Barack Obama that she pays a price for that  But if she has several opponents  it s harder for the antiwar opposition to coalesce Some politicians dream of being all things to all people  but Chafee has a better claim to that fantasy because he was once a Republican senator  then elected governor as an independent  then switched registration to be a Democrat But — like the GOP’s Lindsey Graham  the senator from South Carolina who is also exploring a presidential run — Chafee has strong rhetoric  but a weak personality  That may seem unfair — after all  there’s a wide spectrum of personality types in past presidents  Let’s just say that Hillary would come across as having more gravitas James Henry Webb Jr  has as much gravitas as Hillary  which is not surprising since he was a Marine Corps officer who received a Navy Cross  Silver Star  Bronze Star and Purple Heart  He was secretary of the Navy and assistant secretary of defense  And he has intellectual heft  having taught literature at the U S  Naval Academy and authored 10 books  But as a Virginia Democratic senator he was more of a centrist  so he doesn’t threaten Hillary on the left — and that’s where most Democratic primary voters are Martin Joseph O’Malley just finished his second term as governor of Maryland  Before that  he was the mayor of Baltimore  winning acclaim as an outstanding big city mayor and a rising Democratic star   He was one of the inspirations for the fictional mayor of Baltimore for writers of HBO’s great series   The Wire   In 2004 O’Malley spoke at the Democratic National Convention  arguing that Sen  John Kerry would be better on homeland security than President George W  Bush  but he did not impress the viewing audience the way a new senator from Illinois did  Obama  That continues to be the problem for O’Malley  He’s not an exciting orator  While Hillary is not a great orator  either  she excites the imagination of many Democrats because she’d be the first woman president O’Malley has been semi running for president for months  yet he is still quite unknown  I doubt that Conan O’Brien had him in mind when he made this joke two days ago  “The president of Armenia met with the Kardashians  He asked them to change their name to O’Malley ”Bernard “Bernie” Sanders calls himself a socialist  but if Republicans call him that  it’s considered name calling  Anyway  he’s a true leftist and populist  Recently  while talking about income inequality  he criticized Hillary’s record  saying she was not “prepared to take on the billionaire class ” Since many progressives consider her too friendly to Wall Street interests  Bernie could get traction on that issue — especially with the revelations that foreign governments like Saudi Arabia donated millions to the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as secretary of state  obviously hoping for influence Sanders was elected senator as an independent  yet because he caucuses with the Democrats there doesn’t seem to be any problem if he declares as a Democratic candidate  Like Gene McCarthy’s challenge to President Lyndon Johnson in 1968  Sanders appeals to young  idealistic liberals — and like McCarthy  seems professorial and sincere As a Vermonter  Bernie would be comfortable campaigning in New Hampshire  Yes  New Hampshire is not as liberal in its culture  but he knows how to relate to small crowds and connect federal issues to local and personal interests   He was also a three term mayor of Burlington  Vermont  Hillary will be campaigning in New Hampshire this Monday and Tuesday  She’s wise not to take the Granite State for granted  By the way  you can’t blame Hillary if she’s a bit paranoid about New England at this point  She has had to worry about a possible Massachusetts candidate  Sen  Elizabeth Warren  as well as a Vermonter and Rhode Islander Todd Domke is a Republican political analyst

477,The Edward M  Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate opens its doors Monday with grand political fanfare  President Obama  Vice President Joe Biden and Arizona Sen  John McCain are just a few of the politicos attending the formal dedication ceremony at Columbia Point in Boston   We ll broadcast the event live at 10 a m  That the guest list includes a mix of high profile Democrats and Republicans is no coincidence  The center opens its doors with the lofty goal of restoring respect for Congress at a time when its approval rating is just 18 percent But bipartisan dealmaking was Sen  Ted Kennedy s hallmark attribute  and the institute is trying to rekindle that spirit  It s a teaching facility geared toward students with the mission of helping them understand  and maybe even appreciate  governance The museum  if you can call it that  is high tech and virtual  yet simultaneously steeped in political tradition The one story building is fairly simple from the outside  a polished white facade adjacent to the John F  Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum on the UMass Boston campus But inside all the exhibits revolve around a replica of the U S  Senate chamber — a majestic room with gilded wallpaper and wooden desks modeled off the original congressional furniture The chamber is the epicenter of the institute and it s where most of the activity happens  with daily mock legislative debates  On a recent day  teenagers from Quincy were experimenting with new simulation software  trying to craft a comprehensive immigration reform bill The high schoolers were role playing as U S  senators  arguing over an amendment to establish a biometric tracking system for immigrants The amendment passed  which displeased some  senators   who then began booing Matt Wilding  who runs these immersion simulations at the institute  calmed them down They then tried lobbying one another to swing votes This sort of partisan bickering may be normal in the real Senate  but in the fake chamber the goal is to teach cooperation and negotiation  according to Ed Schlossberg  who created the visitor experience at the Kennedy Institute with his firm ESI Design   Schlossberg is married to Caroline Kennedy  The Senate s dysfunctional reputation is why Schlossberg thinks this legislative simulation is so valuable  It s an educational tool that could help folks understand why Congress is deliberative by nature The institute s president  Jean MacCormack  agrees In addition to immigration  the institute is creating a number of other legislative simulations that deal with the Compromise of 1850  the Patriot Act  the Farm Bill and health care  These simulations are written by universities and research groups  such as the Heritage Foundation  Boston College and the McConnell Center at the University of Kentucky The replica of the Senate chamber is clearly the main attraction  but the institute also includes exhibits about the people  history and structure of the Senate Though to be honest  the word  exhibit  is a bit of an interpretation  The institute is experimenting with new technology  so each exhibit is a display on the wall that can be explored interactively with a tablet One of the only traditional museum spaces is a model of Sen  Kennedy s office  in which audio of his booming voice fills the room as recordings of his famous speeches play MacCormack was also keen to point out a few pictures in the next room But most of this virtual museum does not celebrate Kennedy or his legislative accomplishments  Instead it celebrates the process of government  which is what he wanted  according to his widow Victoria Some of those young people could be those Quincy High School students trying to pass an omnibus immigration reform package in the replica Senate chamber After a couple hours of debating and dealmaking  they were ready for a final vote Wilding  the simulation coordinator  took roll call as each senator yelled out  yay  or  nay  And the students eagerly peered around the room as the vote count popped up on a large screen in the front of the chamber  They could tell it was going to be close The last vote cast was a Democrat from New Mexico   nay  And that meant the nays had it  36 32  The bill failed But that is the value of this simulation — it s an exercise in compromise Student Suhail Purkar  the Maryland Democrat  said he now sees the many roadblocks to passing comprehensive immigration reform more clearly That newfound understanding helps him understand the real Senate better  And that is presumably what Ted Kennedy wanted The institute opens to the public on Tuesday  March 31 This segment aired on March 30  2015 
478,Thursday s public release of a 25 year old surveillance video from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston is raising new questions about the initial investigation into the world s greatest art heist Both the U S  attorney and the FBI have stated that they do not know whether anyone at the FBI ever reviewed the video until a year ago The video is also raising more questions about the security guard who told agents he was tricked into allowing the thieves into the museum On their way out of the museum on March 18  1990  the thieves themselves apparently removed the video shot by the museum s surveillance cameras  It would have shown their arrival outside  and their entry inside the museum  after 1 24 in the morning  But the young FBI agent assigned to the case did collect a video cassette from the recorder that had been in operation the previous day  March 17  The footage released Thursday covers six minutes and 39 seconds  It shows the arrival of a car  with two men  and the entry of one of them at 12 49 a m  The guard publicly identified as Richard Abath admitted the men  in violation of museum security policy    an act he would repeat the next night when the priceless art was actually stolen At the start of the investigation  according to former investigators familiar with the case  that video would have been crucial to the questioning of the guard s story Did anyone at the FBI actually look at that video taken from the museum surveillance camera 25 years ago before someone saw it last year When reached by WBUR Friday  Dan Falzon  the former FBI agent who collected the video as the lead agent 25 years ago  declined comment  He referred us to the FBI At the FBI  supervisory agent Peter Kowenhoven said Thursday   It may have been reviewed back then  I m not sure of the answer to that question  When asked Friday whether Falzon or any other FBI agent ever filed a report    called a  302     describing what was on the video    which would indicate someone actually watched it — an FBI spokesperson in Boston said she needed more time to answer our question Former investigators familiar with the case say that video would have allowed agents to challenge the account of the security guard  Abath  who from day one has adamantly denied any involvement About the release of that video now  Kowenhoven said   Somebody might have been outside  we re just hoping to possibly trigger somebody s memory that will give us that lead and hopefully identify that individual  But there actually were people outside  They went to police and WBUR talked to one of them in 2009 But the men weren t in a marked police car  And she got a good look at the driver  But she says she and her friends were not taken seriously when they talked to the police When she later saw the composite police sketch  she said it didn t look anything like the men she saw Of more importance  perhaps  is how her story differs from the account told by the security guard  According to Abath he saw headlights and then two individuals get out of the car right away But the young woman and her boyfriend said they were on the street for 10 to 15 minutes  maybe more  and they never saw the men get out of the parked car or make the quick exit that the guard described In 2009  she said she d like to know how the museum guard saw the car and the men but not her and her friends In a case of lost witnesses and missed opportunities  the recently found and now newly released video may raise difficult questions for both the security guard and the earlier investigation This segment aired on August 7  2015

486,For years  Jeb Bush was known as “the smart brother ” Not so much these days It began in April when The New York Times learned that he inexplicably listed himself as Hispanic on his voter registration form in 2009  And signed it Last week he made a laughingstock of himself by trying to explain his views on the invasion of Iraq ordered by his brother  President George W  Bush Four days  five positions  In a dizzying array of switchbacks in less than a week  Jeb Bush gave five different answers on the wisdom of fighting a war in Iraq  Rather than using 20 20 hindsight  saying based on what we know now  the country should not have gone to war  he did several verbal back flips Day One  He told Megyn Kelly on Fox News that he would have authorized the invasion of Iraq  but admitted mistakes were made after Saddam Hussein had been removed Day Two  He phoned into Sean Hannity s Fox Radio show to say he had misunderstood Kelly’s question   Hannity gave him a mulligan  same question  “I don’t know what that decision would have been ” Bush tried  “That’s a hypothetical ” Didn t he call in Day Three  At a town hall gathering in Reno  Nevada  he tried this  “Talking about hypotheticals — what would have happened  what could have happened  I think  does a disservice for  the men and women who served in the conflict  ” Huh Day Three and a half  Meeting with reporters after the town hall event  he discussed the virtue of hindsight and tried this  “Of course  given the power of looking back and having that  of course anybody would have made different decisions ” Like what Day Four  In Arizona  he stumbled into a plausible answer  “Knowing what we know now   I would not have gone into Iraq ” Whew  Quite a week Rewriting history  A college student approached Jeb Bush in Reno and asked if he’d take a question from a student  When he agreed  she wanted to know how he could blame President Obama for the existence of a brutal terrorist group in Syria and Iraq  The student said  “Your brother created ISIS ” Ivy Ziedrich  19  is a political science major at the University of Nevada and an active Democrat on campus  although she grew up in a conservative Republican household  She said that the 30 000 Iraqis who were set adrift from the disbanded military helped launch ISIS and have little besides military hardware  Jeb’s response  “We can rewrite history all you want but the simple fact is that we’re in a much more unstable place because America pulled back ” He then abruptly left the event Down and out in Reno  In Reno  Bush accidentally admitted that he was running for president right now  He announced to a reporter from the Washington Post  “I am running for president in 2016 ” This admission matters because an officially declared candidate is legally limited in the amounts of money he or she can take from private donors  Not so an undeclared candidate  Two other PACs have been created for Bush  which will hide the identities of donors and remove limits on how much they contribute  He quickly recanted his worst kept secret Those misogynistic and homophobic tweets  In February  Bush announced the hiring of Ethan Czahor as chief technology officer for his PAC  Right to Rise  Had the unannounced campaign bothered to check his social media postings it would ve found some crude Twitter comments  Between 2009 and 2011 Czahor  now 31  had tweeted that “most people don’t know that  halloween  is German for  night that girls with low self esteem dress like sluts     He also declared that a  new study confirms old belief  college female art major are sluts  science majors are also sluts but uglier ” The resident of San Francisco tweeted that he burped on purpose in the gym to let gay men know he’s straight  He was fired  but the man they introduced as “this great talent” was quickly revealed as a misogynistic and homophobic  his offensive tweets have disappeared What about Iowa  No straw  Last week  Bush’s non official campaign announced that he will pass on the much watched straw poll to be held this August  Straw polls are “not relevant ” he explained  insulting the state’s GOP organizers  Then he promised  “I’m going to campaign hard in Iowa ”According to the Des Moines Register  “Bush ranked in seventh place out of 14 GOP contenders tested in an April 25 May 4  2015 Quinnipiac University poll conducted in Iowa  When Quinnipiac asked likely GOP caucus goers whether there is any candidate they would definitely not support  25 percent named Bush  Bush was at the top of that negative list ” Only New Jersey Gov  Chris Christie fared worse By contrast  Wisconsin Gov  Scott Walker had a 5 1 positive to negative ratio  In voter preference  Walker has fallen to 21 percent  down four points from February  Kentucky Sen  Rand Paul and Florida Sen  Marco Rubio are at 13 points  followed by Texas Sen  Ted Cruz at 12 percent and former Arkansas Gov  Mike Huckabee’s 11 percent Rove punts  Questioned by NBC News on the remarkably bad week Bush had  Fox’s Karl Rove refused to say he was backing Bush  then punted  “Mistakes were made…He’s a smart man…This is a marathon  not a sprint ” If that’s the best Rove  a longtime friend and adviser to the Bush family  can do  Jeb’s hurting Dan Payne is a Democratic political analyst for WBUR and a contributor to The Boston Globe 
487,Forty years after the Vietnam War  it’s easy to see that at least this Vietnamese city is moving on  As we reported this week  there’s a commercial building boom underway here But it’s also easy to recognize the country is still struggling over its own identity  Sure  the political system is communist  But you can’t go by the McDonalds  Dunkin  Donuts  Citibank ATMs  the high end retail shopping district and not think the capitalist Americans have returned It took a few decades  but they are here And there’s the rub  Where is this Vietnam headed as it matures four decades after the war The U S  wants to continue the close ties it now has after normalizing relations 20 years ago  It wants more trade — which  according to U S  Ambassador Ted Osius  is up to $35 billion annually Certainly some people are getting wealthy here  but the average monthly wage is still less than $200 I spoke at length with a 35 year old woman who does business with westerners all the time here  She wants more change and more rapidly  She wants to buy a house  which she can’t now  She also wants more choices at the ballot box than the one party communist choice It’s not hard to imagine there are many more people like her here who see the change and want to taste it themselves On the other side  there’s the former Viet Cong spy we met this week  He just shakes his head at all the changes  and utters   Mistake  mistake  It’s not hard to imagine there are many more people like him too It’s still a new day here  as Vietnam tries to figure out how to move forward — 40 years after the last American troops departed

491,Leaders of the effort to bring the 2024 Summer Olympics to Boston are in Switzerland this week to meet  for the first time  with the International Olympic Committee WBUR s Curt Nickisch is in Switzerland and joined Bob Oakes to discuss Is this the beginning of Boston s effort to sell the city to the IOC Absolutely  although it’s not a hard sell  This is a new thing the IOC is doing to basically meet and greet candidate bid cities from around the world  and it’s supposed to be relaxed meetings  informal conversations  But yeah  Boston 2024 is essentially on a very long application process for a mega sporting event and they’re trying to put their best foot forward These meetings are part of a new selection process that s supposed to bring more transparency  But the meetings are private  Do we have any idea  at this point  what s being discussed Yeah  we do  I met  Wednesday  morning with Boston 2024 just before the team left for the day full of meetings  And Boston 2024 CEO Rich Davey told me that they’ve prepared a lot of questions for the IOC  The Boston group wants to know how far they can go  for instance  to use existing venues to host events to keep costs down  And that’s just one question Davey told me Davey sounds matter of fact there  but what he’s basically saying is that Boston 2024 wants to find out how much money the IOC will chip in to run the games  So while these meetings are supposed to be about getting to know each other  they’re also laying the groundwork for what could be serious negotiations about a mega event down the road Public support is also at issue  The IOC is responding to an apparent decrease in interest in hosting the games by trying to offer more help to potential host cities  How helpful could that be for Boston It could be very helpful  You’re talking about a city that is skeptical of big projects  and so it cannot hurt Boston 2024 that they’re embarking on a bid just as the IOC is rolling out reforms to try to lower the cost of putting on the games and to incorporate city planning better into the Olympics The proof will be in the pudding  The IOC has approved these changes  but still has to show they’re going to act on them and vote that way when it comes to picking bid cities  Wednesday’s meeting is an early step in that process  and it’s a first chance to get a sense of the IOC’s commitment How big a factor is the question of whether the public here in Boston will endorse the city s bid  It’s front and center  for sure  Davey talked about that  Boston 2024 is definitely expecting that question It’s important because the IOC may reject some candidate bids before the referendum is held  and Boston 2024 wants to be on that shortlist  So what the Boston team is saying is that they’re not the only bid city to ever go through a referendum process  They’ll also talk about recent polls that show that support for the Olympics goes up markedly if voters are convinced that public funds will not be used to run the games So they have an answer  but Boston 2024 is going to have to get used to this question  They’re going to be asked about it wherever they go Members of the USOC are also there  What are they adding to the process Stability  really  The top officials from the U S  Olympic Committee  Chairman Larry Probst and CEO Scott Blackmun  they both have a long history working with the IOC — highs and lows  like Chicago’s failed bid for the summer games  So they know the personalities and can introduce Boston 2024 folks who are new to the process The other thing it shows is that the USOC  which sometimes has been at odds with the IOC  is taking the new process seriously and is serious about this bid And it’s not just USOC people  along with  as Boston 2024 has hired a couple of experienced people who’ve worked on other cities  successful bids  So those consultants are here for the same reason  too Also in Switzerland  Zurich  there was huge world sports news overnight  as top world soccer officials were arrested on U S  corruption charges  What s the buzz in Lausanne Word was getting around and Boston 2024 folks did hear about it Let’s be clear  The FIFA charges are not related to the IOC  They are different organizations  They have different power structures and different practices  The IOC did go through its own vote bribery scandal during the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City  the one that Mitt Romney rescued  And the IOC instituted reforms and has apparently moved past that But to have members of one global sporting body arrested at one lake in Switzerland while Boston 2024 is meeting with another global sporting body at another lake in Switzerland  well  it’s an unfortunate coincidence for them This segment aired on May 27  2015

852,Editor s Note  This story contains an offensive word  After considering a diverse array of opinions  both inside and outside the newsroom  we at WBUR decided to publish and broadcast this story without censoring the word  using it just as it was said in the incident A few weeks ago I was interviewing the Rev  Laura Everett  at an intersection in Boston s Back Bay where a bicyclist was recently hit and killed  when in the background  we heard a pedestrian yelling at another pedestrian Everett and a young man standing at the corner looked at each other in disbelief She added   If you ever need an example of human sinfulness  just look at the roads  We are so cruel to one another  Everett crossed the street to try and catch up with the black man  who was walking down the Commonwealth Avenue Mall toward downtown  but he was already gone We finished our interview and I returned to the newsroom  wondering what to do with the recording  Given the number of recent racial incidents in Boston — and the city s long and complex legacy of race relations — we felt we needed to report on what I d heard Boston s ReputationEarlier this year   Saturday Night Live s  Michael Che called out the city before the New England Patriots played the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl A few months later  Baltimore Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said someone at Fenway Park called him the N word  The mayor  the governor and the president of the Red Sox all spoke out  and the next night  fans greeted Jones in a fashion rare for an opposing player    with a standing ovation Hate HotlineHarvard law professor Randall Kennedy wrote a book about the N word  a word he called the  atomic bomb of racial slurs  Kennedy says the current political climate has created a sense that bigotry can be OK And the data back that up  The Anti Defamation League of New England has reported an increase in anti Semitic and other hate incidents in Massachusetts since the election of Donald Trump  And the state attorney general s office says that in response to the hotline it set up  it s received 10 reports of the N word being used over that same period Kennedy stresses that the people who spew racial epithets are not characteristic of the Boston he knows  He says what s characteristic of Boston are the people who reject racism and attempt to marginalize it wherever it pops up But what s characteristic isn t always what makes the news  What does is when a school punishes two black girls for wearing hair braid extensions  That s what happened at the Mystic Valley Regional Charter School in Malden  Two days after the attorney general denounced it for singling out students of color  the school s board of trustees suspended the hair policy  Structural Racism Among those who showed solidarity with the girls in Malden was Rahsaan Hall  director of the Racial Justice Program for the ACLU of Massachusetts Hall points to research that shows African Americans in Massachusetts fare worse than the rest of the country in economic and education measures  And  nationwide  blacks are nearly six times more likely than whites to be incarcerated  in Massachusetts  they re almost eight times more likely Hall is talking about  structural racism   the idea that society is structured in a way that discriminates against minorities So  is there a connection between structural racism and the kind of racism where a white man feels free to shout the N word at a black man  For Hall  the answer is yes  He says acts of individual racism are supported by — and inspired by    structural racism  Why Did I Not Intervene  Two weeks after my interview with Everett  I visited her in her office on Beacon Hill at the Massachusetts Council of Churches  She said she had thought a lot about how she reacted on the street Everett turned the pages of an old Bible for guidance Everett said she s looking for appropriate ways to respond in the future  And Harvard s Kennedy has some thoughts Kennedy says it s also important to approach the person who s been maligned Bear witness  he says  tell the person you saw what happened  express sympathy  and make it clear you re not OK with it This segment aired on June 15  2017

856,Many Muslim Americans will tell you that this is a tough time for them  From the 9 11 attacks to President Trump’s proposed travel ban  Muslims in America feel besieged by discrimination and misunderstanding So Robert Azzi  a Lebanese American Muslim who lives in Exeter  New Hampshire  is hoping to clear up some of that misunderstanding by encouraging dialogue with an invitation to  Ask a Muslim Anything  That’s what Azzi calls the series of conversations that he s been leading at community centers  churches and town halls across New Hampshire  At a recent event in the town of Dublin  in the southwestern part of the state  he welcomed a small audience with the traditional Muslim greeting Azzi is a veteran photojournalist who spent years in the Middle East after growing up in New Hampshire  where there are very few Muslims  Azzi started these conversations a year and a half ago because of what he saw as growing Islamophobia  He wanted to address people’s fears and questions head on Among the questions he got on this night was   Why are so many people in this country afraid of Muslims  Azzi traces it back to the 9 11 attacks  which he says encouraged the false impression that that s when Muslims suddenly arrived in America  when in fact they have been here for centuries He argues that the fear was ginned up by the so called  birthers  who falsely claimed that President Obama was a Muslim who was not born in America  Azzi points out that Trump led that charge  and he argues that as a presidential candidate  Trump rode that fear all the way to the White House The threatening phone calls also came with hate mail  So this is personal for Azzi  But he’s convinced that hearing directly from an American Muslim like him — someone who reveres America s pluralistic traditions as well as his faith — is the best way to break down intolerance A few nights later  at the Community Church in the neighboring town of Harrisville  Jack Calhoun posed a question that Azzi often hears   Why don’t we hear more condemnation of terrorism in the name of Islam from the Muslim community  Azzi offers a terse answer   Because you’re not listening  He points out that Muslims from Tehran to Istanbul to New York denounced the 9 11 attacks  while scores of prominent Muslims around the world have condemned ISIS  But Azzi argues those stories are often overlooked in the current climate Azzi acknowledges that Islam has a problem with fundamentalism  but he points out that Christianity does as well  And he accepts that too many Muslim cultures oppress women And Azzi argues that America has been complicit in propping up some of the regimes that oppress women The Harrisville audience is  for the most part  sympathetic  welcoming Azzi’s effort to open a dialogue about Islam Janet Selle  who came to Harrisville from Keene  said she appreciated what Azzi had to say about the  gentleness of Islam  Azzi says these have been tough years for Muslims like him  but the positive response to these evenings gives him hope Azzi says he likes hosting these  Muslim town halls   but says he looks forward to the day when they’ll no longer be necessary This segment aired on August 14  2017

861,There is widespread confusion and discord around the enforcement of President Trump s travel ban on refugees and people from seven majority Muslim countries So much discord that acting U S  Attorney General Sally Yates — a holdover from the Obama administration — on Monday night said the Justice Department will not defend the refugee ban so long as she s in office Trump promptly fired Yates In the middle of all of this  resettlement agencies are scrambling to get as many refugees into the country as possible A Family Reunion Amid Political TurmoilJust after 1 a m  Tuesday  while chaos and confusion swirled in the political world around them  one family experienced the simple joy of a reunion Seventeen year old Daniel is a refugee from El Salvador  His family said he is fleeing death threats from the violent gangs that wreak havoc over that country  We agreed to use only his middle name  because he fears for his safety His stepfather  Mario Galdamez  hugged Daniel inside Boston s Logan Airport as though he was never going to let him go Galdamez has Temporary Protected Status and lives legally in Lynn  He said having his stepson with him after 16 years is a dream come true While Daniel and his stepfather celebrated their reunion  other families have been hearing news that their loved ones won t be coming to the U S Courtney White is a community service manager at the International Institute of New England  a resettlement agency that brings refugees to Lowell  Boston and Manchester  N H  She helps families from Central America reunite with their loved ones  and she said it s been a tough couple of days White said Daniel is likely one of the last refugees to be resettled in Massachusetts for quite some time Jeff Thielman  CEO of the International Institute  said the agency has until Feb  3 to resettle refugees who were already en route before Trump s executive order The presidential executive order was signed by Trump last Friday  It barred anyone from Iraq  Syria  Iran  Sudan  Libya  Yemen and Somalia from entering the country  The order also suspended the refugee resettlement program for all refugees for 120 days — and indefinitely banned Syrian refugees from entering the U S In his announcement  Trump said the ban is in the name of national security  Not Able To Get On A Plane Ever since Trump s announcement  things have unraveled White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus has said the order was not meant to apply to green card holders  however  that was never made clear by the administration when Trump signed the order Now that several federal courts — including Boston — have issued orders halting Trump s travel ban  it s no surprise that refugee resettlement agencies are dizzied by the pace at which things are changing Thielman said the resettlement process has been completely upended But that flies directly in the face of the Boston federal court order According to lawyers who argued for the plaintiffs  all lawful immigrants  including all approved refugees from those seven countries on Trump s list  are supposed to be admitted into the U S  over the next six days — the duration of the temporary order Thielman said that s just not happening  He said the agency coordinating refugee resettlement abroad continues to comply with Trump s executive order So it s becoming more and more clear that there s little agreement about who can legally enter the U S  in the wake of Trump s executive order The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement saying it will enforce Trump s executive order and that it will comply with the judicial orders as well Civil rights lawyers gathered in airports across the country to make sure the federal court orders are followed  but many international airlines have not been allowing travelers from the seven countries to board planes headed for the U S And in the meantime  many immigrants  refugees and their families have been living in a state of panic At Ascentria Care Alliance  a resettlement agency based in Worcester  employees were doing their best to counsel refugees  but it has been difficult to keep up Ascentria s program manager for new Americans  Mohammed Najeeb  said he wishes he could do more for their clients The problem  it seems  is that the answers are changing every day This segment aired on January 31  2017

873,Although we think of Massachusetts as a solidly  blue  state  more than a million of the state s residents voted for President Trump in November Trump s support came mostly from Plymouth County south of Boston  and from central Massachusetts  There  in the central part of the state  you can drive from the New Hampshire border south to the Connecticut line  and pass through a line of towns that all voted for Trump These are mostly rural communities  where gun rights are important  They are small towns where residents express a sense of disconnection from the booming economy  wealth and politics of Greater Boston In many ways  these central Massachusetts towns are part of the  Rust Belt   similar to the parts of the country that made the decisive difference in the election  western Pennsylvania  Wisconsin and Michigan  where manufacturing jobs have disappeared  and where lots of working class people feel disconnected from the economic and political mainstream  They are part of a deepening political division in this state — much like we are seeing across the whole country  Toy Town  Looks For A Way Forward There are signs of economic life along Central Street in Winchendon  a town of about 10 000 people along the New Hampshire border  A number of new stores have opened recently  and the town is working hard to promote the region’s natural beauty  including nearby lakes  hiking and bike trails But there are also signs of economic decline  empty storefronts in the place still known as  Toy Town   even though the toy industry left long ago  Winchendon is like many towns in the American Rust Belt  hoping for better times ahead  which is why a lot of people there voted for Trump But Algarin is trying to make a go of it  and he’s proud of his homemade cakes  pastries and brisket  Over the door of his kitchen there is a handwritten sign that reads “3 256     the number of pounds of corn beef he’s cooked since Hometown opened three years ago   We re known for homemade corn beef hash ” he said Algarin is lifelong Republican who voted for Trump for a number of reasons  He believes Trump will support veterans like him  He likes Trump s hard line on immigration because  he said  “it s only fair to enforce the law ” And he believes Trump represents a break from the past    a non politician who might finally help working class guys like him Algarin says what Winchendon needs more than anything are jobs and new businesses    some way to recapture the economic glory of the old days Algarin is hopeful that President Trump’s promise to bring jobs back to America can help turn things around in towns like Winchendon  People Wanted Change Again and again  you hear of similar concerns in these towns  a sense of economic decline  a yearning to go back to the way things were  and a willingness to take a chance on a political outsider Winchendon is one of more than a dozen central Massachusetts towns that voted twice for Barack Obama  and then swung Republican to support Trump Hunt says the election divided this town  so she won t say who she voted for because she doesn t want to alienate any potential customers  But she s not surprised that most people in town voted for Trump A lot of people in town agree with that  including Joe Ladeau  owner of Winchendon Furniture  which has been around since 1939  It is one of the few businesses left in town that recalls the days when abundant water power fueled a woodworking industry that made everything from shingles and clothespins to toys and furniture Ask Ladeau how his business is going these days and he chuckles and says   I m glad I m old   expressing a sadness that a way of life is disappearing from towns like Winchendon Ladeau supported the Libertarian Gary Johnson because he said he s sick of the corruption in Washington  He said it may be difficult for many around Boston to understand why so many of his neighbors voted for Trump — but he does The Politics Of DisaffectionAnne Gobi understands the politics of this area as well as anyone  As the local state senator  she represents 28 towns in central Massachusetts that stretch from New Hampshire to Connecticut Gobi is a Democrat  and is well aware that 25 of her towns voted for Trump  So you could forgive her if she’s feeling politically vulnerable these days  but Gobi said she wasn’t surprised that Trump did as well as he did in the towns she represents Gobi says Trump was able to connect with voters in that part of the state — much as he did in parts of the industrial Midwest — with a promise to revive its lost economic vibrancy  It is a message that resonates in towns like Winchendon  which has lost its manufacturing base  The town also faces a challenge from neighboring tax free New Hampshire  which draws shoppers away from its own downtown  And Winchendon is one of many towns in the middle of the state without a rail link to the east Gobi said all this makes her part of the state feel overlooked by Blue State Democrats  So she says Trump stepped in Gobi says whether or not Trump can deliver on his many promises to working class Americans is another question altogether  As a Democrat  she has her doubts  But she says Trump’s message still speaks to her constituents in ways that Democrats in Washington and Boston do not Tomorrow  in Part 2 of our occasional series  a

893,The first weeks of the Trump administration have been marked by controversy  including a court battle over the president s first executive order on immigration  unsubstantiated accusations against a former president and numerous Trump tweetstorms But supporters of the president say he s delivering exactly what he promised That s what we heard again and again in several towns in central Massachusetts that voted for Trump  including Ware  which was once a booming mill town known as  the town that can t be licked  The red brick mill buildings along Main Street are reminders of those days  The Berkshire Blanket Co  is still headquartered here  but most of the mill jobs are long gone  Along Main  there are vacant storefronts  many of them boarded up  Existing businesses struggle to attract customers in a town that has a poverty rate above the state average  So many people here were drawn to Trump s promise to bring back jobs Nicholas Vantangoli  who teaches history  government and sociology at Ware High School  voted for Trump  and represents a political shift in this part of central Massachusetts  Vantangoli comes from a working class family with deep Democratic roots  but he says this last election tugged some of those roots right out of the political soil Vantangoli has another way to measure the political shift  For the past three elections  he has organized a presidential poll for Ware High students  teachers and staff  In 2008 and 2012  the school community voted for Barack Obama  but in 2016 the winner was Trump Vantangoli s poll reflected the real elections in Ware  which is part of a line of central Massachusetts towns that stretch from the New Hampshire border south to the Connecticut line  and which all voted twice for Obama and then shifted for Trump Like many people in this part of the state  he s hopeful that Trump can make good on his promise to bring back jobs and help communities like Ware But Vantangoli believes it will be difficult for Trump to deliver on that promise  “One of the reasons for that is that many of the factories have been closed down for a long while   he said   So I hope he can do something to help  but I don t know  Vantangoli  who still supports Trump  also has concerns about the stormy beginning of Trump s presidency As a public school teacher  Vantangoli is particularly disappointed in Trump s pick for education secretary  Betsy DeVos  who is a proponent of school choice and extremely unpopular among many advocates of public education  The Deplorables  Like What They See So FarIn the village of Gilbertville  which is part of the town of Hardwick  which also voted for Trump   there is an elegant stone church on Main Street  and a beautiful red covered bridge that spans the Ware River  The village offers a reminder of past economic glory in the form of two woolen mills  which shut down long ago Right between them  along the old railroad tracks  stands the Whistle Stop Restaurant  where a group of locals gathers every Wednesday morning to drink coffee and chat  Most of them voted for Trump — and they like to call themselves  The Deplorables   a reference to Clinton’s unfortunate characterization of Trump supporters  Most of them are working class and retired  Some of them grew up Democrats but now vote Republican On a recent Wednesday  they sat on a bench under an American flag  sipped their coffee from Trump coffee mugs  and talked about the president s first weeks in office Among them was Paul Mailhot of Hardwick  who said he likes what Trump has accomplished so far — particularly the president’s hard line on immigration  which Mailhot sees as an effort to enforce the law Bob Bousquet  also from Hardwick  agreed with that view Building the wall along the Mexican border was  of course  one of Trump s biggest campaign promises — and many here support it  and accept Trump s unsubstantiated allegation that immigrants in the country illegally are responsible for high levels of crime  and deprive Americans of jobs The fact that the mills shut down long ago has little or nothing to do with illegal immigration  But the sentiment expressed by Bousquet touches on a recurring theme in this region  a sense of regret about a past that is no longer here Trump connects with folks in this part of the state for other reasons  as well Bill Ward  another retiree from Hardwick  said he likes what Trump says  because I can understand what he says  Ward also likes what Trump has done so far  including the choice of Trump s millionaire and billionaire cabinet members The Political Power Of Rural CommunitiesTodd Smola grew up in nearby Palmer  and is now the local state representative  As a Republican  Smola says he voted for Trump — though not enthusiastically  But he is not surprised that so many of his constituents voted Republican and support Trump  He describes this part of the state as a place where deep family roots  religion and gun rights are sacred  and where many people feel a world away from Boston But Smola says the last election gave them a voice  and they used it to express their frustration about an economy that leaves too many behind  and a political system in Washington that can t fix it  So voters in places like Michigan  Wisconsin  Pennsylvania — and Ware — went with the outsider But Smola said now comes the hard part — and the big question  Will President Trump deliver the change that so many people in this part of the state voted for Bill Ward  one of  The Deplorables  on the bench in Gilbertville  said it is too soon to know the answer to that question  but he said voters like him will hold Trump accountable  And Ward cordially invited us to come back to  the bench  a year from now 
894,The election of President Trump is galvanizing grassroots political resistance across the country It s true across Massachusetts  including in the central part of the state  where Trump carried more than 40 towns — from the New Hampshire border south to the Connecticut line Many of these towns are former manufacturing hubs  where abundant water power fueled mills that brought jobs and prosperity  But much of that industrial base is gone    and  like parts of Pennsylvania  Michigan and Wisconsin    this part of Massachusetts voted for jobs  or at least for change represented by Trump His election shocked Democrats in this area  who are just getting around to asking  What happened  and what now On a recent cold winter evening  Gobi was in Brookfield  another Trump town  where she urged a room full of about 30 Democrats and progressive independents to organize and get involved in local politics More Activists Coming  Off The Bench Just before Gobi spoke  the Brookfield Democrats elected Danielle Kane to be the chair of their town Democratic committee  It was a big moment in small town politics  an example of the kind of grassroots organizing that is happening across the country Kane  44  had never been involved in politics before this  in fact  she wasn t even a registered Democrat until recently  And the Brookfield Democratic Committee was pretty much dead  until she decided to resurrect it Indivisible is a national grassroots organization modeled after the Tea Party movement  It was started by a group of former congressional staffers to resist the Trump agenda  and has already spawned some 4 500 chapters across the country  including many in Massachusetts  from Boston to the Berkshires What Bernie Sanders  And Bill Clinton  UnderstoodAlthough Brookfield is among some 40 central Massachusetts towns that voted for Trump in the general election  it would be wrong to say this part of the state is solidly pro Trump On the contrary  in the presidential primaries most of these towns cast more votes for Bernie Sanders than they did for either Trump or Hillary Clinton  In Brookfield  Sanders beat Clinton by almost 2 to 1 — but in the general election  it chose Trump over Clinton Peter O Connell  the newly elected treasurer of the Brookfield Democrats  agrees with Coughlin s view of why so many central Massachusetts residents voted the way they did in November According to O Connell  the Brookfield Democratic Town Committee used to be active before residents lost interest  for a variety of reasons  They were too busy  nobody wanted to run for public office  and politics became too divisive But O Connell was encouraged to see so many people turn out for the recent meeting on the cold night   It would be unusual to see this many people under any circumstance in Brookfield   O Connell said It is clear that Trump s election has changed things If Tip O Neill  the late Massachusetts congressman and former House speaker  was right that  all politics is local   Democrats in central Massachusetts believe the resistance needs to start locally    in towns like Brookfield This segment aired on March 16  2017

969,On Tuesday  Bostonians will go to the polls to give Mayor Marty Walsh another four year term  or to replace him with City Councilor Tito Jackson A key part of their debate is how best to respond to the economic inequality that increasingly defines Boston Jackson is right about that  A 2016 study from the Brookings Institution found that Boston has the highest rate of income inequality among the country’s largest cities Boston also has a dramatic disparity in wealth along racial lines  According to a 2015 report from the Boston Federal Reserve  entitled  The Color of Wealth   white households in the Boston metro area have a median net worth of about a quarter of a million dollars  while black households have a median net worth of just $8  The report also finds that close to 80 percent of white families own a home  while just a third of black families do  which means blacks have much less ability than whites to pass wealth on to their children — perpetuating that racial wealth gap Jackson argues this has created two Bostons  one wealthy and predominantly white  the other  poor and mostly nonwhite Walsh recognizes the challenge  but he argues that it goes back generations  which is also true  The causes of the wealth gap are many  but they include discriminatory housing and lending policies of the past But Jackson faults Walsh for policies that he says continue to widen economic disparity  and Jackson s chief complaint is about the high cost of housing  He says under the Walsh administration  too much luxury housing is being built at the expense of affordable housing  He also criticizes the mayor for being too cozy with corporations    for giving tax incentives to GE instead of investing more in education Walsh rejects that claim  and points to a number of initiatives that are aimed at narrowing the economic divide  including making good on a promise to increase affordable housing Walsh defends giving tax incentives to GE as a good deal for the city  because of what GE will give back But Barry Bluestone  an economist at Northeastern University  calls this kind of incentive unnecessary corporate giveaways But Bluestone gives Walsh credit for expanding affordable housing and education spending  which he says are two of the most effective ways to level the economic playing field  He also points out that high rates of inequality aren t necessarily evidence of a city on the wrong track  He argues that Boston does a better job than most cities accommodating its poorest residents  thanks to relatively generous state and city rental subsidies  and that growing supply of low income housing This is evidence of something that is working well in Boston  rather than something the city is doing wrong  according to Bluestone On a recent morning in the Haley House Bakery Cafe in Roxbury  opinion was divided as to which candidate would do a better job at closing Boston s economic divide Debbie Denton of Roxbury says she supports Walsh because she believes he s built on the progress of former Mayor Thomas Menino But development and rising property values are good for some  but not everyone   Sitting just a few tables away  Kalamu Kieta  a community organizer and artist from Dorchester  disagreed with Denton  and blamed Walsh for runaway development  which he says makes the divide worse Kieta talked about a mother of four he met recently who has rented the same house in Upham s Corner for the past 37 years  but because of rising rents  she will be forced to move The debate about inequality and the tension between neighborhood stability and development has been around Boston for a long time That 1983 race was the last time a white Irish guy  Flynn  ran against an African American  King   Flynn complains that over the last 20 years  Boston has embraced too much luxury and high rise development to the detriment of working class neighborhoods  like his own South Boston When asked who he supports in the current race for mayor  Flynn declined to offer a full throated endorsement of either Walsh or Jackson Flynn says he believes Walsh is at least trying to bring that balance back  which would help narrow the economic divide  For his part  Jackson is trying to make the case that there is evidence to suggest that Walsh has not been successful This segment aired on November 1  2017 
970,This Saturday s self described free speech rally on Boston Common will be the second one held there this year  But its circumstances couldn t be more different from the first On May 13  a group of veterans  ex police  Tea Party Republicans and young people affiliated with the self described  alt right     a conservative faction that mixes racism  white nationalism  anti Semitism and populism    gathered around the Common s historic Parkman Bandstand Organizers claimed that they were honoring their First Amendment right to assemble and express radical viewpoints  But the event felt more like a small  right wing rally than a celebration of the Constitution Speakers like Augustus Invictus  a political activist from Florida  used their speaking time to encourage attendees to arm themselves for another civil war But that rally passed mostly unnoticed  attracting relatively small crowds  a few hundred at the rally and a slightly smaller crowd protesting it This weekend s rally has the same organizers and the same professed mission  but it will play out against a very different backdrop  the images of lethal violence and homegrown extremists carrying torches and automatic weapons in Charlottesville  Virginia In response  Boston Free Speech  the group behind both rallies  has announced hurried adjustments to Saturday s schedule  It has cancelled a planned march  the program has been shortened by several hours  and three of the four most controversial headliners    including Invictus  who was also present at the Charlottesville rally    have dropped out Event organizer John Medlar says he has invited left wing speakers from groups like Black Lives Matter to take part    without much success so far Back in May  a heavy police presence kept the demonstrations  for the most part  to a war of words  Members in both of the two crowds wielded bats and sticks  but the only rally participant to punch a counter protester was promptly arrested and escorted from the scene Mostly  attendees shouted insults back and forth  both sides accusing one another s members of living in their mothers  basement  Meanwhile  Boston police officers stood  shoulder to shoulder and behind their bicycles  between the two groups Even after the changes to Saturday s rally  a much larger counter protest is taking shape this time around  The organizers who first planned that protest were responding to the violence in Charlottesville  and weren t aware at first that the free speech rally was due to happen at the same time But owing to that coincidence  the protest has attracted a lot of interest on Facebook    and organizer Monica Cannon estimates as many as 20 000 to 30 000 participants might attend Cannon s efforts have been helped along by familiar political organizations like Black Lives Matter and the Women s March Karen Clawson Cosmas  director of March Forward Massachusetts  a group that arose out of the January women s march  says the mood in the country has changed since that day in January  Then  she says  Boston Common filled with people protesting President Trump s  violent words  against women and ethnic minorities As for what will happen Saturday  of course  no one knows  The counter protest does look likely to dwarf the free speech rally  And Boston police  who were effective at containing violence last time  have signaled that they re taking this rally even more seriously    using physical barriers and  neutral zones  to keep the two groups apart  And rally attendees won t be allowed to carry weapons as they did last time Medlar says the area around the Parkman Bandstand could feel a little like  a shark cage   given how large the counter protest may be  But he says he s still looking forward to the event But  Medlar says  his group trusts the Boston Police Department to keep the two crowds safe    and separated from each other This article was originally published on August 18  2017 This segment aired on August 18  2017

972,The runners were still miles from the finish line — somewhere between Hopkinton and Copley Square — but a group of Kenyans at the finish line had a good feeling Historically  Kenyans have dominated the Boston Marathon  Over the last three decades  Kenyan men have won 21 races  while Kenyan women have won 12  But Ethiopians have been more successful in recent years For many of the state s roughly 5 500 Kenyans  seeing their compatriots rule one of the most important sporting events in Boston is a huge thrill Many Kenyans grow up running  Frank Githinji  of Lowell  says there are so many good runners in Kenya that some could give the marathoners a run for their money — if only they had passports  and the desire to race professionally This group of fans waved the Kenyan flag and posed for photos as the elite runners headed for the finish  First it was 37 year old Edna Kiplagat  who crossed the finish line almost a minute ahead of her closest competitor to win the women s race  About a half hour later  24 year old Geoffrey Kerui finished first in the men s race with 21 seconds to spare It s a pride he says he feels every day  but today — like many Kenyans in Boston and around the world — he s elated This segment aired on April 17  2017

974,President Trump used an event honoring Native American veterans Monday to take a shot at Massachusetts U S  Sen  Elizabeth Warren  whom he has long derided as  Pocahontas   a term many find offensive Trump welcomed three Navajo code talkers from World War II to the Oval Office  He called them  incredible  and  very special people  During remarks praising their bravery  service and love for America  Trump said   You were here long before any of us were here  Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago  They call her Pocahontas  But you know what  I like you  The Republican president has repeatedly mocked the Democratic senator for claims she has made about being part Native American Native American leaders have called Trump s past attacks on Warren offensive and distasteful  Some Democrats have called the remark racist Warren quickly denounced Trump s comments White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said a racial slur  was certainly not the president s intent   She added   I think what most people find offensive is Sen  Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career ”The president has long feuded with Warren  an outspoken Wall Street critic who leveled blistering attacks on Trump during the presidential campaign  He has seized in particular on questions about her heritage  which surfaced during her 2012 race challenging incumbent Republican U S  Sen  Scott Brown During that campaign  law school directories from the Association of American Law Schools from 1986 to 1995 surfaced that put Warren on the association s list of  minority law teachers  when she was teaching at the University of Texas and the University of Pennsylvania  Warren said she listed herself with Native American heritage because she hoped to meet people with similar roots In a 2012 interview with The Associated Press  Warren said she and her brothers were told of the family s heritage by their parents  the late Don and Pauline Herring Brown pressed Warren to release more information about how she described her heritage to potential employers  Warren said she never sought proof of ancestry because she didn t think it was necessary Trump honored the Navajo veterans in front of a portrait of President Andrew Jackson  who signed the Indian Removal Act in 1830 With additional reporting by WBUR s Benjamin Swasey This article was originally published on November 27  2017 
975,Massachusetts voters are more concerned than ever about climate change  That s according to a WBUR poll released earlier this summer  which found more of the state’s voters than ever believe climate change is real  already underway and likely to bring serious consequences The poll also found non white voters are even more concerned about the impacts of global warming than are white voters Non white voters are more likely to believe that Massachusetts will suffer consequences like sea level rise  coastal flooding  strong storms and extreme heat  They are more likely to oppose President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord  And  they think that climate change poses a bigger long term threat to the United States than terrorism  while white voters see terrorism as the more serious concern These differences echo national polling over the last few years There are some theories on why different minority groups are more concerned about climate change  One is that minority groups in America have been disproportionately affected by pollution and other environmental hazards  so they support policies which would address them Among American Latinos  opinion appears to have both local and international elements  Concern about local communities exists alongside affinities for countries likely to feel greater impacts of climate change Finally  as with everything  there is a partisan component  with non white voters more like to be younger and to lean Democrat — two groups that are more likely than average to be concerned about climate change Needless to say  grouping the states many racial and ethnic minorities into one unwieldy collection is not ideal and hides deep complexities very much worth exploring  But the unfortunate reality of polling is that even fairly large samples quickly dwindle to unreliability as they are sliced into smaller and smaller pieces What we do know  however  is that the elevated concern among the state’s minority voters has persisted across all of our polls and the WBUR polls on this issue stretching back to 2011 Whatever the full set of reasons  the WBUR poll makes clear that non white voters in Massachusetts are even more concerned about climate change than the state population as a whole  And given the level of alarm the poll found  that’s saying something This segment aired on July 26  2017 
976,Attorney General Jeff Sessions addressed law enforcement and court employees at Boston s federal courthouse Thursday  saying continued cooperation at all levels is crucial to dismantling international criminal organizations like the violent MS 13 gang Sessions cited the success of a multi agency sweep of local members of MS 13 last year  which led to federal racketeering charges for murder  drug trafficking and weapons violations  and put more than 60 alleged gang members behind bars The operation involved officers from the U S  Department of Homeland Security  FBI  state police  and Boston and Chelsea police departments Sessions  visit to Boston comes amid a fierce national debate over enhanced immigration enforcement on behalf of the Trump administration  The attorney general  the highest ranking law enforcement agent in the country  was greeted by a few dozen protesters outside of the Moakley federal courthouse  holding signs reading  Jeff  Go Home  and  Abolish ICE  The protest was organized by the ACLU of Massachusetts and dubbed an  unwelcoming party  for the attorney general Sessions  comments focused primarily on combating organized gangs like MS 13  taking a tough on crime tone and telling gang members directly that  we are coming for you  We will hunt you down  we will find you  and we will bring you to justice  One topic that was noticeably absent from attorney general s remarks was his recent announcement that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would be rescinded  The program  established in 2012 by then President Obama  allowed some young people brought to the country illegally by their parents to live and work in the United States  The announcement was met with stiff pushback from local leaders  calling for a continuation of the program for the nearly 9 000 DACA recipients in Massachusetts Sessions touching down in Boston  a self described  sanctuary city   also highlighted the particularly contentious legal battle over an executive order signed by President Trump on January 25  which in part seeks to strip certain federal funding from cities where local law enforcement do not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials A federal judge in Chicago recently issued a temporary nationwide injunction on the executive order  preventing the Department of Justice from withholding any funds for the time being

982,Despite setbacks on his effort to repeal and replace Obamacare and court challenges to his executive orders on immigration  President Trump remains very popular among his supporters in Massachusetts That s according to a new WBUR poll  topline results   crosstabs  of voters in towns across the central part of the state that voted for Trump in November In Townsend  voters chose Trump over Hillary Clinton 50 to 41 percent  It s one of about 50 towns in the central part of the state that went for Trump  And they are the focus of the WBUR poll  Pretty Much A Total Polarization Townsend has about 9 000 residents  It s a picturesque town along the New Hampshire border  with a pair of churches with white steeples that rise above a Civil War monument on the village green Across the street from the green is Pete s barber shop  which has been at the center of this community for a long time Pete Lareau has been in business for 56 years  in the same location  And like many folks who run businesses around here  Lareau would rather not talk about politics  for fear of alienating his customers But Jim Wiswell is here for a trim  He s a Trump supporter and is happy to talk about how the president is doing so far That view is consistent with the new WBUR poll  which found 80 to 90 percent of Trump voters in these central Massachusetts towns still view him very positively and as likely to make good on his promises The survey found that 42 percent of all voters in these towns view Trump favorably  while 45 percent view him unfavorably  Those numbers might not sound great for Trump  but they re a lot better than his national numbers  And Steve Koczela  president of the MassINC Polling Group  which conducted the WBUR survey  says they reflect strong support from those who voted for him in these towns Koczela says the poll also found evidence of a stark partisan divide And yet the poll found that Trump and Clinton supporters in these towns more or less agree on a series of national priorities  including comprehensive immigration reform  overhauling the tax code  and passing a major infrastructure bill — which is high on Wiswell s list  Pass The Buck And Spin Our Wheels In Townsend  it s easy to find evidence of the political divide  Back on the village green  Krystal Morini is enjoying summer like weather with her 4 year old daughter  Kiara  Morini says she didn t vote in November because she didn t want to choose  the lesser of two evils   But now she feels differently Morini says that kind of behavior makes her worry about the president s fitness to handle national security  Another issue of concern  Morini says her family relies on MassHealth  the state Medicaid program  so she opposes the Republican push to repeal and replace Obamacare The WBUR poll found that the push to repeal and replace Obamacare is among the most divisive issues in these towns Koczela points out that the president has devoted a lot of energy and time to two of the most divisive issues  trying to kill Obamacare and promising to build a wall along the Mexican border — a proposal that  according to the new poll  lacks wide support in both parties The WBUR poll finds that both Republicans and Democrats in these towns agree that comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship should be a priority  Partisans on both sides would put this goal ahead of building a wall  which is modestly popular among Republicans but toxic among Democrats But back at Pete s barber shop  customer Jim Wiswell says he s most concerned that the two parties seem incapable of working together in Washington  despite the evidence of some common ground The WBUR poll found evidence of that growing partisan divide  but also of areas where Democrats and Republicans should be able to work together  Whether they will is another question This segment aired on April 12  2017

985,The Massachusetts Attorney General s office called on a Malden charter school Friday to  immediately  end its policy of banning students from wearing hair extensions  a rule that some have deemed racially insensitive to black students The Mystic Valley Regional Charter School came under fire last week after two black 15 year old students  Deanna and Mya Cook  said the school was giving them detentions for wearing hair extensions Mystic Valley officials have said hair extensions are specifically banned because they could divide students  from dissimilar socioeconomic backgrounds  The school also bans  drastic or unnatural hair colors or styles such as shaved lines or shaved sides or have a hairstyle that could be distracting to other students  extra long hair or hair more than 2 inch in thickness or height is not allowed   The school says its hair style policy  including the extension ban  helps create an environment that lets students stay focused on education However  the Cooks said that black students are more likely to wear hair extensions than their white peers  therefore making the policy discriminatory In a letter Friday  the state attorney general s office said it is concerned the school s policy on hair treats black students differently than white students — which would be a violation of federal and state law The letter  signed by Genevieve Nadeau  chief of the civil rights division at the state attorney general s office  directed the school to end the possibly discriminatory policy and to stop punishing students who have hair extensions   shaved sides   dyed hair or hair that s more than 2 inches in thickness or height The AG s office is currently investigating Mystic Valley over the controversy and said there seems to be  substantial evidence  that the school s hair style policy is not consistently enforced between white and black students — something the Cooks also alleged The letter cited photos on social media showing white students with dyed hair or  shaved sides  as evidence that enforcement of the policy is inconsistent and  unlawful  The letter said Mystic Valley s policy is harsher than similar rules at other charter schools   suggesting that there are less restrictive  and potentially less discriminatory  alternatives available  On Monday  the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts filed a complaint against Mystic Valley regarding the hair style policy According to the letter  the school s board of directors is scheduled to hold an emergency meeting Sunday night With reporting from WBUR s Newscast Unit

1047,When Martin Luther King Jr  spoke at Temple Emanuel in Worcester in 1961  he opened with these words Whenever I return to the New England states  I never feel like a stranger because I’ve spent some three or four years in this area attending Boston University and Harvard University  so I feel like I m coming home when I come back this way For decades  tapes from this speech were stored in a crowded box belonging to Rabbi Joseph Klein  who invited King to speak at the temple Klein’s granddaughter  Laura Klein Weiner  says she first learned her family had the tapes in 2013 Shortly after the discovery  Klein Weiner asked a friend to post the recordings online  but they didn t get much notice  She then decided to re post them herself  just last month on MLK Day  on her SoundCloud account  This time  more people were able to find it and listen  including us We sat down with Tommie Shelby  professor of African American studies and philosophy at Harvard  to discuss elements of the speech Bob Oakes  One thing that struck us are some of the similarities between this speech and Dr  King s famous “I have a dream  speech he made two years later  He basically ends both speeches the same way  Do you think this speech is in a way a precursor to the famous March on Washington speech Shelby  The subject of the two speeches is quite similar  He’s talking about the state of race relations  how far we’ve come and how far we have to go  and where we have to go to get there  The Worcester speech is probably one of the earliest recordings of this set piece of his rhetorical repertoire  coming two years before the “I have a dream” speech Dr  King starts with an optimistic tone  saying that African Americans are making strides  they’re earning more than in past decades  they’re seeing the walls of segregation slowly starting to crumble  and then Dr  King says this Now it is a fact that we’ve come a long  long way and it is true but if I stop at this point  I will leave you the victims of a dangerous optimism  If I stop at this point  I will leave you the victims of an illusion wrapped up in superficiality  In order to tell the truth  it is necessary to move on Help us understand what is going in Dr  King’s mind at this point and where he’s directing his urgency The speech is structured around avoiding extreme optimism and extreme pessimism  King’s own position is kind of realism and truth telling  He’s insisting that we have a long way to go  but we won t get there without determination  sacrifice and a sense of urgency Rabbi Klein led Temple Emanuel at the time when he introduced King  At one point before King takes questions  he compares the civil rights leader to the prophet Moses  I think that the situation with the Negro people in this country is analogous to what happened with the Israelites in Egypt  They too had to wait for a leader  and I think all of us will agree that they have found this leader in Dr  Martin Luther King How do you think Dr  King views himself and how do you think he thought about Rabbi Klein’s comparison You often see a comparison between the Israelites’ struggle for freedom and the black freedom struggle and many blacks now are eager to see a heroic  wise  powerful leader emerge — a black Moses if you will  However  King would often caution against the “drum major instinct ” This is a desire to lead the parade and feel superior  King thought leaders should see themselves as servants willing to sacrifice themselves for others After the speech  Dr  King answered some questions from the audience  It was Dr  King unrehearsed  unfiltered  at times lighthearted and funny  I want to play just a small part of that now Rabbi Klein  Do you believe that the fear of miscegenation or economic fears are the major stumbling blocks to the acceptance of integration by white southerners MLK  I would say these are the two basic fears  On the one hand  the white south is seeking to defend and preserve a preferred economic position  Also the fear of intermarriage is one of the big fears in the south today  My argument is always this  Properly speaking individuals marrying  not races  so this question should not even come up in the struggle for civil rights  We must make it clear that the basic aim of the Negro is to be the white man’s brother and not his brother in law   laughter What struck you most about this Q amp A I really enjoyed this part of the recording the most  frankly  You see him discussing black nationalism  interracial marriage  economic inequality  many other matters  You get a feel for what was often reported by his friends  that he had a great sense of humor  was really good with jokes and quick to make you laugh  You don’t always get a feel for that in his speeches when he’s much more austere and restrained Are these recordings important historically in terms of giving us a new insight into Dr  King The Q amp A part of it allows you to hear him stretch out on certain issues I appreciated hearing Dr  King in long form as opposed to soundbite One worry I often have I have about a focus on phrasings is that people can make them mean anything they want  even in narratives Dr  King didn’t support  Having a chance to look at how he develops his political philosophy in extended form blocks some of these unfortunate indications of his words

1131,Convicted mobster James “Whitey” Bulger  who rose to power as a secret informant to the FBI and counted on FBI agents to help him get away with murder and extortion  has been killed in prison  a source says  He was 89 At the time of his death  Bulger was serving two consecutive life sentences  He had just been relocated to high security Hazelton prison in West Virginia He lasted less than a day there In a statement Tuesday  the Federal Bureau of Prisons said Bulger was found unresponsive in his cell at about 8 20 a m  A law enforcement source  speaking on condition of anonymity  told WBUR that Bulger was beaten to death In a statement  the U S  attorney in West Virginia said it and the FBI will conduct an investigation into Bulger s death According to Justin Tarovisky  executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 420  which represents corrections officers at the Hazelton prison  Bulger s death is being investigated as a homicide Richard Heldreth  another Local 420 official  told WBUR there have now been three homicides in seven months at the prison Bulger had well known heart problems  he had told his lawyer he had had several heart attacks while in prison  His death raised questions among his attorneys about why the wheelchair bound Bulger was moved to the Hazelton prison Jay Carney  who defended Bulger in his Boston federal court trial in 2013  said in a statement Tuesday that Bulger  was sentenced to prison  but as a result of decisions by the Federal Bureau of Prisons  that sentence has been changed to the death penalty   A Ghostly Presence Until his 2013 trial  Bulger had avoided prison for decades  thanks to his connections to the U S  Department of Justice and an inside tip in 1994 that he was about to be arrested  His 16 year run as a fugitive made Bulger a legend and deeply embarrassed the FBI He had become an old man by the time he was arrested in 2011 He was one of the most feared men in the history of Boston Bulger rose from the projects of South Boston  along with his brother William  whose parallel path to power went to politics and the presidency of the Massachusetts Senate and later the University of Massachusetts From boosting goods from the backs of trucks   Whitey  Bulger graduated to bank robbery and a stint in federal prison  including Alcatraz  of which he was a proud alumnus  Back on the streets  he joined an Irish gang called Winter Hill and killed as a favor for the Mafia He was cunning  disciplined and low profile  But Bulger s rise from gangster to godfather was enabled and empowered by the U S  government s war on organized crime  in which the enemy was the Mafia — the Italian American gangsters  and not the Irish Americans What Boston Mafia boss Gennaro Angiulo and his lieutenants did not know about their outside hit men was this  Bulger and his partner Stephen  The Rifleman  Flemmi had been recruited as secret FBI informants Credited inside the Justice Department with helping take out the top and middle tier of the local Mafia  Bulger and Flemmi turned the Federal Bureau of Investigations into the Bulger Bureau of Investigations Bulger corrupted his FBI handler John Connolly  who grew up in the same Southie housing project  He corrupted Connolly s supervisor  John Morris  With cash  gifts and master manipulation  Bulger compromised a number of agents who wined and dined him in their homes and in his From them  Bulger gained intelligence about rival gangsters and surveillance operations by honest law enforcement agents in which he was the target  One agent gave Bulger 40 pounds of plastic explosive  according to testimony at trial  Bulger was even given the identity of people informing about him  whom he then murdered One Of America s Most WantedFrom the time he went on the books as an FBI informant in 1975  Bulger commanded fear across the city without incurring so much as a misdemeanor until 1995 A team of state police detectives and a DEA agent and a couple of federal prosecutors finally built a case against Bulger  and overcame the entrenched opposition of the FBI  But Bulger was tipped off to his coming indictment  The heads up came from Connolly  the star FBI agent  Off went Bulger with his longtime girlfriend Teresa Stanley  but he soon brought her home and picked up his other girlfriend  Catherine Greig Bulger went uncaptured for 16 years  Posters of America’s Ten Most Wanted pictured Bulger alongside Osama bin Laden The astonishing break came in June 2011  after the FBI released a public service announcement focusing on Greig  the blond companion who was 20 years younger than Bulger   Have you seen this woman   the ad asked In short order  Bulger and Grieg were captured in a rent controlled apartment in Santa Monica  California Bulger came back to a city different from the one he d left  His brother John had done a stint in prison for lying to a grand jury when asked about  Whitey   And his brother William had been forced out of office as university president after being subpoenaed to a congressional hearing and deliberately questioned in public in regard to  Whitey s  whereabouts After he asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself  William Bulger was then given immunity and forced to answer questions in a subsequent hearing in Washington in 2003  Reacting to his assertions of failed memory and apparent evasions  congressmen accused William Bulger of lying  It did not help his cause that a leaked grand jury transcript quoted him as saying he hoped his brother would never be captured When  Whitey  was put on trial in 2013  William Bulger never appeared  The FBI Sat Back And Didn’t Do A Damn Thing Though Bulger was convicted of all but one count at his trial  victims expressed frustration that those who had empowered and enabled Bulger were not held to account Tommy Donahue s father was gunned down by Bulger as he gave a ride home to someone who was talking to the FBI It was a wreckage field that was deep and wide  and though Bulger may have been the executioner  it had started with a secret special relationship with the Justice Department Former Republican U S  Rep  Dan Burton summarized the findings of a congressional investigation into the scandal this way   Rogue members of the FBI  up to the highest levels  protected informants at the expense of innocent people  Informants committed murders with impunity  Killers were tipped off so they could flee without being arrested  For that period of time  Kevin Weeks might add this epitaph  recalling that over a span of over 20 years   Whitey  Bulger could wake up every day  look out his window on to Boston and say to himself   I own this town  With additional reporting

1137,An old murder  an elderly gangster and a 56 year war on organized crime take center stage Wednesday in Boston federal court  as a former head of the New England Mafia  Frank Salemme  goes on trial He s charged in connection with the 1993 disappearance of a South Boston nightclub manager  Steven DiSarro  whose remains were found in Rhode Island in 2016 The government’s star witness is Salemme s erstwhile best friend  Steven Flemmi  better known for his other former partner  James  Whitey  Bulger The trial  like the era that’s coming to a close  features bitter enemies  betrayals  a relentless prosecutor  corrupt agents and the crushing defeat of the mob David Boeri spoke with Morning Edition host Bob Oakes about the long running saga  Their lightly edited conversation is below Bob Oakes  Remind us who Frank Salemme is David Boeri  The rise and fall of Frank P  Salemme takes us back to the 1950s and 1960s  to a Boston that doesn’t exist anymore  It s a Boston that was a city of grifters and loan sharks and enforcers  of crooked cops on the take  an Irish gang war  And all at the time when U S  Attorney General Bobby Kennedy launched his war on organized crime  which really meant the Mafia  And he did that here in Boston Salemme was a gangster from Jamaica Plain at the time who teamed up with Flemmi and they went to work for themselves  They contracted themselves out as hit men for the mob  “They called me the general ” Salemme once told me  “I planned them and I did them ”One of their career highlights involved a couple sticks of dynamite under a car that blew the leg off the lawyer representing the notorious gangster turned cooperating government witness  Joe Barboza  Salemme was later convicted of the crime and went to prison for 16 years  but he kept his mouth shut about Flemmi  who he blames for the bombing Flemmi  on the other hand  was protected by the FBI  As for Salemme  he just happened to get arrested in the middle of the day on the streets of New York in 1972 by a young FBI agent named John Connolly  who just happened to recognize him as a fugitive Eventually  Salemme would become the boss  the godfather  of the New England Mafia  as it was collapsing under the barrage of federal prosecutors  But he did not have long to enjoy it  In 1995  Salemme was indicted along with Flemmi and Whitey Bulger  Bulger became a fugitive and so did Salemme We know it took years to capture Bulger  What about Salemme It took less than eight months  And for what’s been the running theme of Salemme’s life  it was the result of a betrayal  When he was getting ready to stand trial for that indictment  Salemme discovered that his old partner Flemmi had been a longtime secret FBI informant  along with Bulger  He was outraged  So he pleaded guilty instead of going to trial next to Flemmi  and in so doing he became the first crime boss in Mafia history to turn government witness Salemme was also a witness in the trial here in Boston that led to the conviction of the disgraced retired FBI agent  Connolly That s right  and he was a major witness because he testified that Connolly had tipped off Bulger and Flemmi before that secret indictment became public so they could take off What did the government do in return for Salemme’s testimony It recommended a reduced sentence and they put him in the witness protection program  But here’s the key  The government gave Salemme immunity for all the murders he committed  but only if he admitted to them  And that was what would lead to this latest trial Let s talk about the murder victim in this latest case  What’s involved in the current case regarding the murder of Steven DiSarro In 1993  DiSarro  of Westwood  was the manager of a nightclub in South Boston  which had once been known as the Channel  But the actual owners of the club were Salemme  Flemmi and Salemme s son  Frank Salemme Jr  And they were hiding their financial interest because they would never get a license if the authorities knew they were owners So DiSarro was the straw  according to the government and mobsters alike FBI agents were investigating the club and one agent actually approached DiSarro on a street in Boston s Combat Zone to try to question him or talk him into being an informant  One of Flemmi’s sons told me that word got back to Salemme and Flemmi  They were concerned DiSarro was talking too much  So they decided he had to go He was 43 when he disappeared after getting into a red car in front of his house in Westwood in 1993 Within a couple days  investigators told me  they learned from an informant that DiSarro had been murdered in Salemme’s house in the town of Sharon  strangled by Salemme s son in the presence of Salemme Sr  and his brother and another associate  who s also charged with and on trial here for murdering a witness But in 1993 DiSarro s corpse was missing and so the case went cold for 23 years What broke the case open Until a couple years ago  Salemme was living low to the ground in Atlanta back in the federal protection program  when some of his mob associates in Providence got into a jam And the government was ready to help them out in return for what they had to offer Turns out  there was a hole behind an old mill in Providence  and one of Salemme s closest associates in the Mafia is prepared to say that Salemme told him back in May 1993 to get ready to receive a package And that mobster’s brother  who Frank initiated into the Mafia  will testify that he took delivery of DiSarro s body and drove it to the hole where the remains were found 23 years later  in 2016 Does the government have a witness to testify to seeing Salemme and his associates actually murder DiSarro Yes  and true to the story of betrayals  that star witness is none other than Flemmi  who will say he walked in on the murder in Frank’s house on that fateful day So now we are about to have an octogenarian testifying against another octogenarian  Flemmi and Salemme  in a courtroom that could look like a geriatric ward in what is probably the end of the line for the war on organized crime Bobby Kennedy launched in 1961 It s a saga 56 years in the making  a war that was sometimes dirty  sometimes involved agents and cops who were as dirty as the mobsters And now in what seems like the final act  you have the relentless longtime prosecutor Fred Wyshak  whose zealousness brings comparisons to Ahab  He got Bulger  who you could say is the white whale  Now he s going after the last standing guy  but what does it tell you that they re bringing in the last target in a wheelchair This segment aired on May 9  2018

According to his wife  he died after a brief bout with cancer Goodwin was among the youngest members of President John F  Kennedy s inner circle and among the last survivors  Brilliant and contentious  with thick eyebrows and a mess of wavy curly hair  the cigar smoking Goodwin rose from a working class background to the Kennedy White House before he had turned 30  He was a Boston native and Harvard Law graduate who specialized in broad  inspirational rhetoric    top JFK speechwriter Theodore Sorensen was a mentor    that  would move men to action or alliance  Thriving during an era when few feared to be called  liberal   Goodwin also worked on some of Johnson s most memorable domestic policy initiatives  including his celebrated  We Shall Overcome  speech  But he differed with the president about Vietnam  left the administration after 1965  and would later contend    to much debate — that Johnson may have been clinically paranoid  Increasingly impassioned through the latter half of the  60s  he co wrote what many regard as then  Sen  Robert Kennedy s greatest speech  his address in South Africa in 1966  Kennedy bluntly attacked the racist apartheid system  praised protest movements worldwide  and said those who speak and act against injustice send  forth a tiny ripple of hope  Goodwin s opposition to the Vietnam conflict led him to write speeches in 1968 for Kennedy and to manage the presidential campaign for anti war candidate Sen  Eugene McCarthy  But McCarthy faded  Kennedy   My best and last friend in politics   Goodwin wrote  was assassinated  and Republican Richard Nixon was elected president  Goodwin never worked for another administration  although he and his wife were fixtures in the Democratic Party and he continued to comment on current

talents  Even one of his supporters  historian and fellow Kennedy insider Arthur M  Schlesinger Jr   would say that he  probably lacked tact and finesse   But Schlesinger also regarded Goodwin as the  archetypal New Frontiersman  of JFK s brief presidency Richard Naradof Goodwin was born in Boston on Dec  7  1931  but spent part of his childhood in suburban Maryland  where he would recall being harassed and beaten because he was Jewish  His enemies only inspired him  He graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University  at the top his class from Harvard Law School  then clerked for Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter  the first of a series of powerful men Goodwin worked under His road to Kennedy s Camelot began not with an election  but with the corruption of TV game shows  He was an investigator in the late  50s for the Legislative Oversight Subcommittee of the U S  House of Representatives  which helped reveal that the popular  Twenty One  program was rigged  Goodwin s recollections were adapted into the 1994 film  Quiz Show   directed by Robert Redford and featuring Rob Morrow as Goodwin  who was one of the producers   Quiz Show  received four Academy Award nominations  including for best picture  but was criticized for inflating Goodwin s role in uncovering the scandal His efforts were noticed by Kennedy  then a U S  senator from Massachusetts and aspiring presidential candidate  Goodwin was hired to write speeches for the 1960 race  advised Kennedy for his landmark television debates with Nixon and held a number of positions in the administration  from assistant special counsel in the White House to an adviser on Latin America  When the president was assassinated in 1963  Goodwin took on a sensitive task    prodding the military to act upon Jacqueline Kennedy s wishes and place an eternal flame at the national cemetery in Arlington  Virginia Under Kennedy  Goodwin s most ambitious work may have been on the Alliance for Progress  a program of economic and social reforms meant to break the U S  from its history of supporting dictators in Latin America  The alliance was announced in March 1961 with a promise from Kennedy that the spirit would not be  an imperialism of force or fear but the rule of courage and freedom and hope for the future of man   In the long term  the alliance had mixed results  as support dropped among subsequent administrations  In the short run  it was overshadowed by an imperialist fiasco  the Bay of Pigs invasion  the failed U S  backed attempt in April 1961 to overthrow Cuba s socialist government  led by Fidel Castro Goodwin had questioned the plan  but still had to answer for it  Not long after the Bay of Pigs  he met with Castro ally and finance minister Ernesto  Che  Guevara  the two of them sitting on the floor of a hotel room in Monte Video  Uruguay  They were both in town for an Inter American conference that was to ratify the alliance After Kennedy s death  Goodwin was implored to stay on by the new president   You re going to be my voice  my alter ego   Goodwin remembered Lyndon Johnson saying  There was constant tension between Johnson  a Texan  and the  Harvards  around Kennedy  but Goodwin initially had strong influence and was an essential shaper of LBJ s legacy  He was assigned key policy speeches  including the 1964 address at the University of Michigan  when Johnson outlined his domestic vision of a  Great Society   Johnson s 1965 civil rights speech to a joint session of Congress is among the most famous presidential orations in history  It was written by Goodwin    within hours  he alleged    in the wake of the bloody marches in Selma  Alabama  and ended with an exhortation  drawing upon the language of the protest movement  that reportedly left the Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  in tears Upon signing the Voting Rights Act in August 1965  Johnson gave the pen to Goodwin  But by then  LBJ had committed ground troops to Vietnam and Goodwin was personally and professionally estranged  He had become convinced  he later wrote  that  President Johnson s always large eccentricities had taken a huge leap into unreason  Goodwin s theory was widely debated  He was backed by Time magazine journalist Hugh Sidey  while former Johnson aide Jack Valenti said Goodwin was simply trying  to flog a book  Goodwin was married for 14 years to Sandra Leverant  who died in 1972  Three years later  he married Doris Kearns  a former LBJ aide who became one of the country s most popular historians with such works as  Team of Rivals  and  No Ordinary Time   Goodwin had three children  one with his first wife and two with his second Goodwin s other books included  Triumph or Tragedy  Reflections on Vietnam   released shortly after he left the Johnson administration and  Promises to Keep   He also wrote a play   The Hinge of the World   later retitled  Two Men of Florence    a drama about the clash between Galileo Galilei and Pope Urban VIII that reflected on the need to raise  poor  lowly creatures  from ignorance so they could  travel the Heavens  
1146,The fungal disease white nose syndrome has killed off millions of bats across America  Since it was first identified in 2006  it’s appeared on bats in more than 30 states  including all of New England  Quebec and the Maritimes Now  scientists are trying to learn more about the impact of this devastating disease  by listening to the calls of the bats left behind If a bat flies in a forest and no one’s around to hear it  does it make a sound Well  not a sound our ears can hear Bats use echolocation to navigate and find food  It s similar to sonar  with a bat sending out sound pulses and then listening to the echoes that bounce back Scientists can learn a lot from those calls — by recording them  slowing them down  and shifting their pitch  so our ears can hear it Take  for example  this little brown bat recorded in southwest Connecticut Chris Wisniewski  who teaches biology at Southern Connecticut State University  said in Connecticut  that sound used to be a lot more common Wisniewski is clued into bat calls  Last year  he set up microphones all over the state  recording hundreds of hours of them The idea was to figure out what bats are out there and what they’re doing White nose is a fungus that affects bats when they hibernate  It gets on their skin  and causes bats to do odd things  like fly around in the winter But what about those bats that do bounce back Dunbar said over the years  scientists have developed computer programs  cataloguing lots of echolocation calls  Think of it like a dictionary for “bat speak ”From that  Dunbar said  you can learn a lot about bats Like the eastern red bat  a migratory species  which popped up at microphones Wisniewski put near bodies of water on the edges of forest Or this big brown bat  recorded exhibiting a  feeding buzz  at Indian Well State park in Shelton  Big brown bats were  by far  the bat Wisniewski recorded the most As he recorded around the state  Wisnewski said getting lots of big brown bats confirmed other surveys in the region  and hinted that big brown bats  with their larger fat reserves  appear to be better at shaking off white nose And now that the little brown bats are  essentially  gone — Wisniewski said his research raises another question Miranda Dunbar said learning more about those survivors is the next step for bat research And while Dunbar isn’t optimistic white nose syndrome will be “cured” anytime soon  she’s hopeful bat acoustic data will continue to unlock more secrets about the bats weathering white nose This story was first published by Connecticut Public Radio

1173,Federal authorities in Boston believe they ve pretty much closed the book on organized crime in the area The lead prosecutor in the recent murder conviction of former New England mobster Francis  Cadillac Frank  Salemme was Fred Wyshak He spoke with Morning Edition to talk about the Salemme case  as well as other major organized crime trials he has led On the Salemme caseI do think it’s a watershed type event that the main players during the era of organized crime in Boston during the  80s and  90s are now all incarcerated On accuracy of  Black Mass  in its portrayal of the  Whitey  Bulger investigationThat portrayal in the movie  I think  is an amalgam of what was going on between myself and other FBI agents  who to some extent undermined the progress of the investigation On why John Connolly is in prison and not other FBI agentsWell  I think there was testimony about other FBI agents who had obstructed investigations of  James  Whitey   Bulger and  Stephen  Flemmi and other members of Winter Hill  Connolly became prosecutable primarily because he tipped Bulger and Flemmi off in 1995  and we were able to indict him within five years of the tip off  His conduct was still within the statute of limitations I think that there were several FBI agents who were aligned with Connolly  did things that they shouldn’t have done  because they thought that it was in the best interest of the FBI and the FBI’s agenda  which in that period was to take the mafia down On John Martorano  the hit man and witness who tied Bulger to killingsThe decision to enter into a plea agreement with John Martorano was probably one of the toughest decisions I’ve ever had to make as a prosecutor and convince my superiors that that was the right thing to do  Ultimately  you know  I think we made the right decision  Prior to that  we did not have a murder case on James Bulger  John Martorano gave us a murder case on James Bulger and on John Connolly  Nobody’s happy that he’s killed as many people as he has and he’s out walking the streets now  Nobody’s happy about that  But when you look at the bigger picture  that was the right call to make On the dangers of being a prosecutor I mean  generally  there’s lots of threats  Rarely is there any action It just never occurred to me that I was going to stop what I was doing because the bad guys out there were threatening  making threats  It’s just not part of what a prosecutor should do On what organized crime in Boston looks like nowIt looks like a bunch of disorganized thugs  There’s no sophisticated organization like there have been before  Quite frankly  the threats now are coming more from emerging organized crime groups  gangs  rather than the mafia This article was originally published on July 12  2018 This segment aired on July 12  2018
