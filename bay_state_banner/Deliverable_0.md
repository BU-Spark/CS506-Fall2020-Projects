For our project, we will be working with the Bay State Banner evaluating data on real
estate development in various neighborhoods in Boston. We primarily intend to focus on
gathering data on developers and companies who are building in neighborhoods which are
primarily home to POC and analyzing which developers are approved most often to build in the
city (and if possible on neighborhood lines). Datasets provided by the Bay State Banner for our
project include: ZBA data on proposed (approved and not approved) building projects, a list of
non-profit organizations for the purpose of discounting non-profit entities from the findings, a
list of campaign contributions (and the specifically real-estate affiliated donors), and
demographic data for various neighborhoods in Boston.

Our first goal is to gather data on developers who are approved for and currently building
in various neighborhoods in Boston, focusing on those which are home to POC communities. For
this, we plan to use the demographic data for the city to decide which neighborhoods to focus on
and the ZBA data to determine what projects are currently ongoing in those neighborhoods. With
these results, we can gather information on the developers, whether they are for- or non-profit, if
they are campaign contributors, the demographics of the developers, and the make-up of the
buildings approved in those areas. We will combine this data to create statistical models of the
demographics of types of buildings and developers who are active in those areas, and if we have
time, partition that data between different parts of the city for comparison.

We additionally plan to look into the total list of proposed projects in those
neighborhoods and to compare the data on the most approved types of buildings/developers/etc,
from those less likely to be approved. We will be analyzing this data on the same lines as the
previous data, this time comparing the types of projects approved in these communities. We will
look at what factors lead to high approval rates (demographics, building types, donations, etc.). If
there is the time, we also would like to compare these factors across neighborhoods to find out if
the types of projects proposed and approved vary across neighborhood lines and if specific types
of developers are ‘targeting’ certain neighborhoods for development.
