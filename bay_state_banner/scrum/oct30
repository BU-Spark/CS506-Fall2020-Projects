We have up until this point found the top 100 developers who have had projects approved for new buildings in Boston.
We can use this list to go further in analyzing these players and their other contributions, as well as areas of focus.

Our next step is to meet w Gowtham to discuss the ZBA data and cleaning up the dataset. We additionally plan to look through the projects for the neighborhoods distribution split on demographic data etc before next meeting. We also can continue to pull out the top names and connect them. We plan to filter the data based on type of project as well to filter out maintenance projects etc.

We encountered a few issues with the data set from the last class of people who worked on the project, and are planning to meet with them or their project manager to clear up issues.
We also will be cleaning up the data a bit to work with our plans more effectively.

We talked to client today! We'll be meeting again in 2 weeks. So far they seem happy with progress and approve of our current direction and goals.
