# description for this folder<br>
the csv file "Food_Establishment_Inspections.csv" is too big to store here as we state in scrum, when we download the dataset(keep it the same folder with python file), first we did the filter to store the data we want to keep<br>
Then we turn it into json file which is smaller and easier to process or merge with other dataset.
