# Parking Lots Project Description| City of Boston Department of Neighborhood Development

Main Objective: Create a master dataset of parking lots in the City of Boston by cross referencing and using multiple data sources. This dataset will provide insight on what parking lots are used or vacant, and can help the Department of Neighborhood Development decide whether these lots could serve a better use.

# Week 1 Progress

1. Met with Mario, our client to better understand goals and expectations
2. Collected data sources.
3. Will analyze data and how it can used.

# Project Goals
1. Create a parking lot dataset containing attributes such as location, size, use rate, owners , vacancy, ground images, and aerial images.

2. Figure out whether these parking lots are vacant. Additionally, obtain aerial images of these lots.

(Depending on time taken /difficulty of building Parking dataset.)
3. Analyzing the trends of parking space usage due to covid. Attributes analyzed can include the increase or decrease of usage in certain parking spaces, transformation/elimination of parking spaces, and the impact of remote work and ban of indoor dining on parking spaces. 

# General Steps Overview for Parking Dataset
1. Collect and add basic parklot data from multiple sources to our master dataset. Basic data includes location, size, owner, etc..

2. Find out if parking lots are currently vacant or in use. Add this status to dataset. If not find out if it is a commercial or private lot.

3. Obtain and add aerial imagery to corresponding parking lot.

4. Analyze trends seen in dataset. This includes conversion from private/commercial to vacant , amount of vacant parking lots in certain neighborhoods , average lot size , etc..
