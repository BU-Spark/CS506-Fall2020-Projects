# 11/6 Scrum meeting 

What have I worked on?

- We worked on the analysis of “appeal” cases. And we use a python plot library to discover the trend of different dismissed/granted/denied cases and we follow the timeline to discover the pattern of them. We also extract the keywords in the explanation section to discover the key words information behind them.

What will I be working on next?

- We will go to scrape the new dataset given by our client, and continue to work on the analysis of dismissed/granted/denied cases. Since our previous data is insufficient to conclude solid conclusions behind that. We will use new data to fill in the blanks.

Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?

- We find that the old dataset( scraped online) does not provide enough information. We are now trying to create a new dataset with the pdf documents that clients sent to use.The format of the old pdf and new pdf is slightly different, but we are on the right track to put the new pdf into our dataset.
Also, find the keyword or key sentences for the dismissal order / granted order might be difficult, since both two orders have similar keywords.


Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?

- We meet our client this week. The next meeting should be next*2 week. But we will meet our PM next week
