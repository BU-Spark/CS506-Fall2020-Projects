# 10/23 Meeting

What have I worked on?

- We successfully convert the links to first 20 pages of non-precedent decisions at [here](https://www.uscis.gov/administrative-appeals/aao-decisions/aao-non-precedent-decisions) into text files respectively.

What will I be working on next?

- We plan to extract the desired information from these text files, for example, year/month of decision was made, the case ID, and ...
- Convert the pdf to csv file instead of text file.

Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?

- We found out it's really hard as we tried to extract information from a text file. All information are messed up together. Hence, we decide to try csv file next week. I hope we can make data extraction process much easier. 
- I don't think we need help.

Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?

- We meet PM at 10/23. The representative of client also show up. We are going to meet again next Friday.
