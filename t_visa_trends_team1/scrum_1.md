# 10/16 Meeting

What have I worked on?

- Use python package scrapy to crawl all pdf links to the Non-precedent decisions, and save these links into a single txt file.

What will I be working on next?

- We decided to work with team 2 together to collect dataset since at this stage, most of our work are the same, so we don't want to waste time. For next week, we will try to download these files by years, and convert them into txt file.

Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?

- I didn't think we run into any issues at this stage. All we need to do is to sure we will not miss any links during scraping.

Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?

- We plan to meet PM weekly so we can keep on the right track. The representative of client will show up as well.
