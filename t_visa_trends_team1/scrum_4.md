# 11/13 Scrum meeting 

What have I worked on?

- We are working on scraping the new data given by our client, we extract data from the pdfs that client sent us, and put these data into our new  dataset. The new dataset format should be pretty similar to the old one.

What will I be working on next?

- We are going to continue working on scraping the new data that was distributed by our client and try to finish all of the questions. And we also need to create a new dataset based on these newest data.

Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?

- The python packages we used to convert pdf do not work well with the new data. It took us some time to find new packages to extract information. I believe we can finish the scraping before deliverable 2, so we are all good.

Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?

- We meet our client weekly by meeting. Client are satisfied with our progress. Our next meeting will be in two weeks.
