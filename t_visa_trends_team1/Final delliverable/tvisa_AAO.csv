The T classification affords nonimmigrant status to victims who assist authorities investigating or prosecuting acts or perpetrators of trafficking, and affords derivative status for immediate family members. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form I-914, Supplement A, Application for Immediate Family Member ofT -1 Recipient (T derivative application), concluding that because the Applicant's Form I-914, Application forT Nonimmigrant Status (T application), had been denied, the Derivative was ineligible as the immediate family member of a T 
-1 nonimmigrant. On appeal, the Applicant asserts that her T application was erroneously denied, resulting in the improper denial of the T derivative application. Upon de novo review, we will dismiss the appeal. Approval of the T derivative application is contingent upon the approval of the principal T application. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(o)(9), (s)(5). The Director denied the Applicant's T application and in separate proceedings, we subsequently dismissed the appeal of that denial. As the Applicant's T application has been denied, the Derivative is ineligible for nonimmigrant classification as the immediate relative of a T 
nonimmigrant pursuant to section 101 ( a)(15)(T)(ii) of the Act. ORDER: The appeal is dismissed. Cite as Matter o.fC-Y-D-G-, ID# 295905 (AAO June 6, 2017) 2"

See Immigration and Nationality Act section 101(a)(l5)(T)(ii), 8 U.S.C. § 110l(a)(15)(T)(ii). The T classification affords nonimmigrant status to victims who assist authorities investigating or prosecuting acts or perpetrators of trafficking, and affords derivative status for immediate family members. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Applicant's principal Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status. The Director also denied the Derivative's Form 1-914, Supplement A, Application for Immediate Family Member of T-1 Recipient, concluding that because the principal Form I-914 had been denied, the Derivative was ineligible to be classified as an immediate family member of a T-1 nonimmigrant. The matter is now before us on appeal. Upon review, we will summarily dismiss the appeal. An officer to whom an appeal is taken shall summarily dismiss any appeal when the party concerned fails to identify specifically an erroneous conclusion of law or statement of fact for the appeal. 8 C.F.R. § 103.3(a)(l)(v). The Applicant did not provide a statement in support of the appeal that specifically identities an erroneous conclusion of law or statement of fact in the decision being appealed. On the Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, the Applicant stated that a brief or additional evidence would be submitted within 30 days of the August 9, 2017, tiling date. However, we have not received anything further from the Applicant to date. Because the Applicant has not identified a specific, erroneous conclusion of law or statement of fact in the Director's decision below, the appeal must be summarily dismissed. Additionally, approval of aT derivative application is contingent upon the approval of its principal T application. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(o)(9), (s)(5). U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records do not reflect that the Applicant has filed an appeal of the principal application's denial. Because the Applicant's T application has been denied, the Derivative is ineligible for nonimmigrant classification as the immediate relative of aT nonimmigrant pursuant to section 101 (a)(l5)(T)(ii) of the Act."

The Applicant filed a timely appeal to the Administrative Appeals Office, which we dismissed on the merits. The matter is now before us on a motion to reopen and reconsider. The motions will be denied. A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be proved and be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(2). A motion to reconsider must: (1) state the reasons for reconsideration and be supported by any pertinent precedent decisions to establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services policy; and (2) establish that the decision was incorrect based on the evidence of record at the time of the initial decision. 8 C.F .R. § 103 .5( a)(3 ). On motion, the Applicant suggests that he is no longer represented by his former attorney because he cannot afford her legal fees and ""[d]ue to ineffective assistance of counsel."" The Applicant's claim, however, is not supported by the evidence required to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, the Applicant's assertion does not include: (1) an affidavit setting forth in detail the agreement that was entered into with counsel with respect to the actions to be taken and what representations counsel did or did not make to Applicant in this regard; (2) evidence that counsel whose integrity or competence is being impugned has been informed of the allegations leveled against her and given an opportunity to respond; and (3) evidence as to whether a complaint has been filed with appropriate disciplinary authorities with respect to any violation of counsel's ethical or legal responsibilities, and if not, why not. See Matter of Lozada, 19 I&N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), affd, 857 F.2d 10 (1st Cir. 1988). The Applicant also requests an additional period of 3 0 days ""to submit [his] appeal [sic] brief and additional evidence,"" and to ""confer ... with non-profit organizations that are assisting [him] so that they can amply research the legal case precedents on this matter, address the issues that need to be"
