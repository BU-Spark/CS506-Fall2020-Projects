Procedural History
The applicant filed this Form I-914 on August 25, 2009. The director subsequently issued a Request for 
Evidence (RFE) of, 
inter alia
, the applicant's victimization and his resultant presence in the United States. 
The director found prior counsel's response to the RFE insufficient to establish the applicant's 
eligibility and denied the application for failure to establish that the applicant was a victim of a severe 
form of trafficking in persons and was present in the United States on account of such trafficking. On 
appeal, counsel submitted additional evidence and legal briefs reasserting the applicant's eligibility. 
1
The AAO issued a request for additional evidence (RFE) on October 6, 2011 regarding the applicant's 
physical presence in the United States on account of his trafficking. Having received no response from 
counsel, the AAO dismissed the appeal on March 30, 2012, determining that the applicant had established 
that he was a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, but had not overcome the director's 
conclusion that he was not physically present in the United States on account of the trafficking. On April 
30, 2012, the AAO received a letter from counsel stating that her office had mistakenly sent the RFEresponse to the Vermont Service Center rather than the AAO. On May 2, 2011, counsel filed the instant 
motion to reopen and reconsider with a copy of her RFE response, which included counsel's letter brief, a 
supplemental statement from the applicant, copies of non-precedent AAO decisions in other T cases and a 
copy of a December 20, 2011 joint letter from law professors. The AAO reviews these proceedings 
de 
novo.

Applicable Law
  
Section 101(a)(15)(T) of the Act provides, in pertinent part, that an applicant may be classified as a T-l 
nonimmigrant if he or she is:
(i) [S]ubject to section 214(o), an alien who the Secretary of Homeland Security, or in the case of 
subclause (III)(aa) the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Attorney General, 
determines--
(I) is or has been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as defined in section 103 of 
the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000,
(II) is physically present in the United States, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the 
Northern Mariana Islands, or at a port of entry thereto, on account of such trafficking, 
including physical presence on account of the alien having been allowed entry into the United 
States for participation in investigative or judicial processes associated with an act or a perpetrator 
of trafficking;
(III) (aa) has complied with any reasonable request for assistance in the Federal, State, or local 
investigation or prosecution of acts of trafficking or the investigation of crime where acts of 
trafficking are at least one central reason for the commission of that crime;
(bb) in consultation with the Attorney General, as appropriate, is unable to cooperate with a 
request described in item (aa) due to physical or psychological trauma; or
(cc) has not attained 18 years of age; and
(IV) the alien would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal [.] 
Section 103(8) of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), codified at 
22 U.S.C. § 
7102(8)
, defines the term ""severe forms of trafficking in persons"" as:
1 
Footnote 1.  The director issued separate decisions denying the applicant's spouse's Application for Immediate Family Member of T-l 
Recipient (Form I-914A) and his son's From I-914A. However, counsel submitted one appeal for the principal applicant's Form I-914 and the 
two derivative Form I-914A applications. The AAO will consider the denial of the Form I-914 on appeal since the approval of the two Form 
I-914As is dependent on the principal applicant's eligibility for T-l nonimmigrant classification.
