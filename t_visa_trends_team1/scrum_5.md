# 11/20 Scrum meeting 
 
What have I worked on?
 
- We discover that The trend for the decided cases and dismissals we can see can see their trend looks quite similar, the both went up, went down, then went up again. For the granted cases, we can see that the number of cases stay quite low for a long time and jump up erratically in recent years. The overall decided cases and granted cases all less than the number of dismissed cases. We plot a figure to find the trend of all applications from 2004 to 2020. Since motion cases are only a small portion of total cases, we didn’t find any specific patterns that were different from Figure 1. However, according to Figure 2 and Figure 3, we can assume that June is a good month to submit an application, the applications submitted on 25th of each month are most likely to be granted, and Tuesday is also a good day to start an application. Besides, during preprocessing, we found derivative applications (applications for family members) are actually most likely to be rejected/denied. Hence, derivative applications are not recommended.
 
 
 
What will I be working on next?
 
- We will go to perform NLP analysis on this textual information and try to figure out which words have an effect on different cases.
 
Have I run into any issues? Do I need help?

- We were facing some issues with our new dataset. Firstly, it’s hard for us to find the most frequent sentences in the description.We use two nlp libraries to figure it out. 
We also find it’s difficult to get the urls from the new pdf file. But we solved this problem.
 
Have I talked to the client recently? When are we meeting with them next?

- We met our client this week. The next meeting should be next*2 week. But we will meet our PM next week
