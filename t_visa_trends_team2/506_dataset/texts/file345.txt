U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8771994 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 1, 2020 The Petitioner, a commercial bank, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as an "associate" under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty ( or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record did not establish that the proffered position qualifies as a specialty occupation. The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 291 of the Act; Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we conclude that the record, including information submitted on appeal, establishes that the particular position is so complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a bachelor's or higher degree in a specific specialty, or its equivalent. Therefore, the record satisfies the criterion at 8 C.F .R. § 2 l 4.2(h)( 4)(iii)(A)(2). Further, the Petitioner has established that the proffered position qualifies for classification as a specialty occupation as defined by section 214(i)(l) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1184(i)(l), and 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(ii). Additionally, the record establishes that the Beneficiary is qualified to perform the duties of the proffered position by holding a qualifying degree from an accredited college or university in the United States. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(C). ORDER: The appeal is sustained.
