U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9367592 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 21, 2020 Form 1-485, Application for Adjustment of Status of U Nonimmigrant The Applicant seeks to become a lawful permanent resident (LPR) based on his "U" nonimmigrant status as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(m). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (U adjustment application), and the matter is now before us on appeal. Upon de nova review, we will remand the appeal. I. LAW A U nonimmigrant may adjust status to that of an LPR at the discretion of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) unless USCIS determines, based on affirmative evidence, that the U adjustment applicant unreasonably refused to provide assistance in a criminal investigation or prosecution. Section 245(m) of the Act. To establish eligibility, the applicant must demonstrate that since being granted U nonimmigrant status, he or she has not unreasonably refused to provide assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity that formed the basis of the underlying U nonimmigrant status. 8 C.F.R. §§ 245.24(a)(5), (b )(5). The applicant may submit, as supporting evidence, a newly executed Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Supplement B), or a signed statement from a law enforcement agency or official affirming that the applicant complied with, or did not unreasonably refuse to comply with, reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution during the requisite period. 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(e)(l). If the applicant does not submit a newly executed Supplement B or signed statement as described above, he or she should submit an affidavit describing efforts to obtain such evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(e)(2). An applicant must establish each eligibility requirement of the benefit sought by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375-76 (AAO 2010).
