U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9991435 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 21, 2020 Form 1-485, Application for Adjustment of Status of Alien in U Nonimmigrant Status The Applicant seeks to become a lawful permanent resident (LPR) under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255(m), based on his "U" nonimmigrant status as the victim of qualifying criminal activity. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-485, Application for Adjustment of Status of Alien in U Nonimmigrant Status (U adjustment application), and the matter is now before us on appeal. Upon de nova review, we will remand the matter to the Director for the issuance of a new decision. I. LAW USCIS may adjust the status of a U nonimmigrant to that of an LPR if, inter alia, he has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of three years since the date of his admission as a U nonimmigrant. Section 245(m)(l)(A) of the Act. To demonstrate continuous physical presence, a U adjustment applicant must provide, among other requirements, a photocopy of all pages of all passports valid since the date of his admission as a U nonimmigrant or, in the alternative, an equivalent travel document or a valid explanation of why he does not have a passport. 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(5). II. ANALYSIS The Applicant was granted derivative U nonimmigrant status from October 2015 to September 2019. He filed the instant U adjustment application in January 2019. The Director denied the application, finding that the Applicant had not complied with 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(5) because, although he submitted a complete copy of his passport valid from August 2009 to August 2015, he did not provide a complete copy of his current passport, valid from July 2018 to July 2028.1 On appeal, the Applicant submits a complete copy of his current passport. Because this evidence is directly relevant to the Director's ground for denial of the Applicant's U adjustment application, we will remand the matter for further consideration of whether the Applicant has satisfied the requirements of 8 C.F.R. 1 The Director's decision did not address, as it pertains to the requirements of 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(5), the time period from when the Applicant was granted derivative U nonimmigrant status in October 2015 to the issuance of his current passport in July 2018.
