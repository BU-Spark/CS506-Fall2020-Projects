U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9027071 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for UN onimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 30, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonirnrnigrant Status (U petition). On appeal, the Petitioner submits a brief and additional evidence, asserting his eligibility. We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW Section 101 ( a)(l 5)(U)(i) of the Act provides U-1 nonimmigrant classification to victims of qualifying crimes who suffer substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of the offense. U petitioners must also establish that they possess information regarding the qualifying crime and have been helpful, are being helpful, or are likely to be helpful to law enforcement officials investigating or prosecuting the qualifying criminal activity. Id. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over U petitions, and the petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4); MatterofChawathe, 25 l&NDec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). To meet this burden, U petitioners must submit a Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonirnrnigrant Status Certification (Supplement B), from a law enforcement official certifying the petitioner's helpfulness in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity.1 Section 214(p)(l) of the Act; 8 C.F .R. § 214.14( c )(2)(i). The Supplement B must be submitted as initial evidence with the U petition and have been signed by the certifying official within the six months preceding the filing of the petition. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). Although a petitioner may submit any relevant, credible evidence for us to consider, USCIS determines, in its sole discretion, the credibility of and the weight given to all of the evidence, including the Supplement B. Section 214(p)(4) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4). 1 The Supplement B also provides factual information concerning the criminal activity, such as the specific violation of law that was investigated or prosecuted, and gives the certifying agency the opportunity to describe the crime, the victim's helpfulness, and the victim's injuries.
