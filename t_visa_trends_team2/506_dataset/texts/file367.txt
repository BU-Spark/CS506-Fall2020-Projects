U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9643216 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-485, Application to Adjust Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 3, 2020 The Applicant is a citizen of Pakistan who seeks to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident under section 13 of the 1957 Immigration Act (Section 13). 8 U.S.C. § 1255b. Section 13 allows a foreign national who was previously an A-1, A-2, G-1, or G-2 nonimmigrant to adjust status if certain criteria are met. 1 The Applicant bases her claim to adjustment of status under Section 13 upon that of the principal applicant's eligibility. The Director of the National Benefits Center denied the application, concluding that the Applicant was not eligible to adjust status under Section 13 because the principal applicant (her spouse) was also ineligible for the requested benefit. We summarily dismissed a subsequent appeal pursuant to the regulations at 8 C.F.R. §103.3(a)(l)(v), because the Applicant did not identify any erroneous conclusion oflaw or statement of fact in the Director's decision. The matter is now before us on a combined motion to reopen and reconsider. The Applicant asserts that a final decision concerning the principal's eligibility has not yet been made, and requests reopening of these proceedings so that her adjustment application may be considered together with the principal' s application. In these proceedings, it is the Applicant's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. Section 291 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361. Upon review, we will dismiss the motion to reopen and reconsider. In general, the official who made the latest decision in the proceeding may, for proper cause shown, reopen the proceeding or reconsider the prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(i)-(ii). A motion to reopen is based on documentary evidence of new facts, and a motion to reconsider must show that our decision was based on an incorrect application of law or policy to the evidence in the record of proceedings at the time of the decision. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(2)-(3). We may grant a motion that satisfies these 1 Pub. L. No. 85-316, 71 Stat. 642, amended by Pub. L. No. 97-116, 95 Stat. 161 (1981).
