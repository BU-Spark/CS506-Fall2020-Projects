U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6622595 Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office DATE: JUNE 17, 2020 Appeal of Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina Field Office Decision Form 1-601, Application to Waive Inadmissibility Grounds The Applicant, a native and citizen of Pakistan, seeks a waiver of inadmissibility under section 212(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. ยง l 182(i), for fraud or misrepresentation. The Director of the Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina Field Office denied the application, concluding that the record did not establish that the Applicant's only qualifying relative, his U.S. citizen spouse, would experience extreme hardship because of his continued inadmissibility. The Director also found that the Applicant did not merit a waiver as a matter of discretion. In these proceedings, it is the Applicant's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1361; Matter ofSkirball Cultural Ctr., 25 l&N Dec. 799,806 (AAO 2012). Except where a different standard is specified by law, an applicant must prove eligibility for the requested immigration benefit by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375-76 (AAO 20 I 0). This office reviews the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christa's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537,537 n.2 (AAO 2015).

If the foreign national demonstrates the existence of the required hardship, then he or she must also show that USCIS should favorably exercise its discretion and grant the waiver. Section 212(i) of the Act. A determination of whether denial of admission will result in extreme hardship depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Matter of Cervantes-Gonzalez, 22 l&N Dec. 560, 565 (BIA 1999) (citations omitted). We recognize that some degree of hardship to qualifying relatives is present in most cases; however, to be considered "extreme," the hardship must exceed that which is usual or expected.
