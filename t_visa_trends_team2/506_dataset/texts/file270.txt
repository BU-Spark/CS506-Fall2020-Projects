U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 10106684 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WLY 23, 2020 The Petitioner, an information technology services provider, seeks to employ the Beneficiary temporarily under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations.1 The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Vermont Service Center Director denied the Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, concluding that the record did not establish: (1) that the proffered position qualified as a specialty occupation; (2) that the Petitioner would have an employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary; and (3) additional issues relating to the Beneficiary's status. The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 2 We review the questions in this matter de nova. 3 Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LEGAL FRAMEWORK Section 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b) of the Act defines an H-lB nonimmigrant as a foreign national "who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform services ... in a specialty occupation described in section 214(i)(l) ... "(emphasis added). Section 214(i)(l) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1184(i)(l), defines the term "specialty occupation" as an occupation that requires "theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States." The regulation at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(ii) largely restates section 214(i)(l) of the Act, but adds a non-exhaustive list of fields of endeavor. In addition, 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) provides that the 1 See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 10 l(a)(l 5)(H)(i)(b ), 8 U.S.C. ยง l 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b ). 2 Section 291 of the Act; Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). 3 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
