U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 5631030 Appeal of National Benefits Center Decision Form 1-360, Petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 18, 2020 The Petitioner seeks classification as a special immigrant juvenile (SIJ) under sections 101(a)(27)(J) and 204(a)(l)(G) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(27)(J) and 1154(a)(l)(G). The Director of the National Benefits Center (Director) denied the Petitioner's Form 1-360, Petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ petition), and the Petitioner appealed that decision to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO). Subsequent to the filing of the appeal, the District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a judgment in R.F.M. v. Nielsen, 365 F. Supp. 3d 350 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Pursuant to that judgment, the Petitioner has established his eligibility and the appeal will be sustained. I. LAW To establish eligibility for SIJ classification, petitioners must show that they are unmarried, under 21 years old, and have been subject to a state juvenile court order determining that they cannot reunify with one or both parents due to abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law. Section 101(a)(27)(J) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 204.ll(c). Petitioners must have been declared dependent upon the juvenile court, or the juvenile court must have placed them in the custody of a state agency or an individual or entity appointed by the state or the juvenile court. Section 101(a)(27)(J)(i) of the Act. The record must also contain a judicial or administrative determination that it is not in the petitioners' best interest to return to their or their parents' country of nationality or last habitual residence. Id. at section 101(a)(27)(J)(ii). U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole authority to implement the SIJ provisions of the Act and regulation. Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, §§ 471(a), 451(b), 462(c), 116 Stat. 2135 (2002). SIJ classification may only be granted upon the consent of the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (OHS), through USCIS, when the petitioner meets all other eligibility criteria and establishes that the juvenile court order was sought to obtain relief from parental abuse, neglect, abandonment, or a similar basis under state law and not primarily to obtain an immigration benefit. Section 101(a)(27)(J)(i)-(iii) of the Act; Matter of D-Y-S-C-, Adopted Decision 2019-02 (AAO Oct. 11, 2019). Petitioners bear the burden of proof to demonstrate their eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010).
