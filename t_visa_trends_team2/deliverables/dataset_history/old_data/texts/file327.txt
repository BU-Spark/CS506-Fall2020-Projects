The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-485, Application for Adjustment of Status of Alien in U Nonimmigrant Status (U adjustment application), and the matter is now before us on appeal. Upon de nova review, we will remand the matter to the Director for the issuance of a new decision. I.

II. ANALYSIS The Applicant was granted derivative U nonimmigrant status from October 2014 to September 2018. She filed the instant U adjustment application in October 2018. The Director denied the application, finding that the Applicant had not complied with 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(5) because she did not provide a complete copy of her current passport, valid from October 2017 to October 2027. Specifically, the Director noted that the copy she submitted was missing pages 14 and 15. 1 On appeal, the Applicant submits a complete copy of her current passport, including the previously-missing pages 14 and 15. Because this evidence is directly relevant to the Director's ground for denial of the Applicant's U adjustment application, we will remand the matter for further consideration of whether the Applicant 1 The Director's decision did not address, as it pertains to the requirements of 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(5), the time period from when the Applicant was granted derivative U nonimmigrant status in October 2014 to the issuance of her current passport in October 2017.
