U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services InRe: 9475101 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 9, 2020 The Petitioner, a consumer goods and retail company, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a support associate under the H-lB nonirnrnigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b). The Director of the California Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record did not establish that the proffered position qualifies as a specialty occupation under any of the criterion found at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that the Director erred in denying the petition.

According to section 212(n)(l)(A) of the Act, an employer must attest that it will pay a holder of an H-lB visa the higher of the prevailing wage in the "area of employment" or the amount paid to other employees with similar experience and qualifications who 1 We follow the preponderance of the evidence standard as specified in Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375-76 (AAO 2010).
