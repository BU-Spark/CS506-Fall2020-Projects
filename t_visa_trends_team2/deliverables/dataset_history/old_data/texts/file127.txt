U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9872070 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 28, 2020 The Petitioner, a real estate company, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a "business analyst" under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations.
