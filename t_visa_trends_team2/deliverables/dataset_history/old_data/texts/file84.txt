U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 7141746 Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JULY 30, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification under sections 101 ( a)( 15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), because the record established that the Petitioner was inadmissible to the United States and her Form 1-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as Nonimmigrant (waiver application), requesting a waiver of the grounds of inadmissibility, had been denied. On appeal, the Petitioner submits a brief and previously submitted evidence, asserting her eligibility. We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is required to determine whether any grounds of inadmissibility exist when adjudicating a U petition and may waive certain grounds of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion. Section 212(d)(14) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(14). The U petitioners bear the burden of establishing that they are admissible to the United States or that any grounds of inadmissibility have been waived. 8 C.F.R § 214.l(a)(3)(i). To meet this burden where the record establishes inadmissibility, petitioners must file a waiver application in conjunction with the U petition, requesting a waiver of the grounds of inadmissibility. 8 C.F.R §§ 212.17, 214.14(c)(2)(iv). The denial of such a waiver application may not be appealed. 8 C.F.R. § 212.17(b )(3). Although, we do not have jurisdiction to review the Director's discretionary denial of a waiver application, we may consider whether the Director's underlying determination of inadmissibility was correct. II. ANALYSIS The Petitioner, a native and citizen of Mexico, claims to have last entered the United States without admission or parole in March 2006. She filed this U petition in October 2014 based on her minor child having been a victim of a qualifying criminal activity.
