U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 7305096 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-918, Petition for UN onimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 06, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p), of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Petitioner's Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), concluding that the record did not include a properly executed Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Supplement B).
