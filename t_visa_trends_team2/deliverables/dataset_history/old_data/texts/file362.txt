U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6340548 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 3, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Petitioner's Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), concluding that the Petitioner did not establish his admissibility, as required. The Director concurrently denied the Petitioner's Form 1-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as Nonimmigrant (waiver application), finding that a favorable exercise of discretion was not warranted. The Director's decision to deny the U petition is before us on appeal. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW When adjudicating a U petition, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determines whether a petitioner is inadmissible, and has the authority to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion. Section 212( d)( 14) of the Act, 8 U.S. C. § 1182( d)(l 4 ). U petitioners bear the burden of establishing that they are admissible to the United States or that any applicable ground of inadmissibility has been waived. 8 C.F.R. § 214. l(a)(3)(i). To meet this burden, an inadmissible U petitioner must file a waiver application in conjunction with the U petition, requesting waiver of any grounds of inadmissibility. 8 C.F.R. §§ 212.17, 214.14(c)(2)(iv). The denial of a waiver application is not appealable. 8 C.F.R. § 212.17(b)(3). A petitioner must establish that he or she meets each eligibility requirement of the benefit sought by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375-76 (AAO 2010). The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) reviews the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). II. ANALYSIS The Petitioner, a native and citizen of Mexico, filed the instant U petition in August 2014. In September 2018, the Director denied the petition, determining that the Petitioner had not established that he was admissible to the United States. The Director explained that she was unable to conclude that a favorable exercise of discretion was warranted and the waiver application was denied.
