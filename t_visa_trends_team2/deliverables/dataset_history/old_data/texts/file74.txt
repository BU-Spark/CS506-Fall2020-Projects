U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8409282 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 9, 2020 The Applicant seeks T-1 nonimmigrant classification as a victim of human trafficking under sections 10l(a)(15)(T) and 214(0) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(T) and 1184(0). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status (T application), concluding that the record did not establish that the Applicant was the victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and therefore also did not establish his eligibility for T classification under additional grounds of eligibility. In addition, the Director determined that the Applicant is inadmissible to the United States and his Form 1-192, Application for Advance Pennission to Enter as a Nonimmigrant (waiver application), submitted to waive this inadmissibility had not been granted. On appeal, the Applicant submits a brief asserting his eligibility. We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW Section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act provides that applicants may be classified as a T-1 nonimmigrant if they: are or have been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons; are physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; have complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking; and would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1 l(b)(l)-(4) (2018). The term "severe form of trafficking in persons" is defined as "the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery." 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(a).1 1 The Department of Homeland Security issued an interim rule, effective January 18, 2017, amending its regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11 for victims of human trafficking who seek T nonimmigrant status. See Classificationfor Victims of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons; Eligibility for "T" Nonimmigrant Status (Interim T Rule), 81 Fed. Reg. 92266, 92308-09 (Dec. 19, 2016).
