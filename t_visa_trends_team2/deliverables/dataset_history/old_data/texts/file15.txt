U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6596284 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 4, 2020 Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Religious Worker-R-1) The Petitioner, a church, seeks to classify the Beneficiary as a nonimmigrant religious worker to perform services as a "Church Intensive Coordinator." See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) Section 101(a)(15)(R), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(R). This nonimmigrant R-1 classification allows profit religious organizations, or their affiliates, to temporarily employ foreign nationals as ministers, in religious vocations, or in religious occupations in the United States. The Director of the California Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the Petitioner did not demonstrate that the proposed position qualifies as a religious occupation. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(r)(3) (2017) (defining "religious occupation"). The Petitioner appeals, claiming that as a "Church Intensive Coordinator," the Beneficiary will "engage[] in and, according to the denomination's standards, qualif[y] for a religious occupation . . " See id. ( defining "religious worker"). In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, its eligibility for the requested benefit.
