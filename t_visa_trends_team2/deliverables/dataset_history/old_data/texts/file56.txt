U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 1175515 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 1, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), and the matter is now before us on appeal. On appeal, the Petitioner submits a brief and copies of previously submitted documents. The Administrative Appeals Office reviews the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christa's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, the matter will be remanded to the Director for the issuance of a new decision. I. LAW To qualify for U-1 nonimmigrant classification, a petitioner must establish that he or she: has suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been the victim of qualifying criminal activity; possesses information concerning the qualifying criminal activity; and has been helpful, is being helpful, or is likely to be helpful to law enforcement authorities investigating or prosecuting the qualifying criminal activity. Section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Act. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over U petitions, and the petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4); Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). As a part of meeting this burden, a petitioner must submit a Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Supplement B), from a law enforcement official certifying a petitioner's helpfulness in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity. Section 214(p)(l) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). The petitioner must also provide a statement describing the facts of his or her victimization as well as any additional evidence he or she wants USCIS to consider to establish that he or she is a victim of qualifying criminal activity and has otherwise satisfied the remaining eligibility criteria. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(ii)-(iii). Although a petitioner may submit any relevant, credible evidence for us to consider, USCIS determines, in its sole discretion, the credibility of and weight given to all the evidence. Section 214(p)(4) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4).
