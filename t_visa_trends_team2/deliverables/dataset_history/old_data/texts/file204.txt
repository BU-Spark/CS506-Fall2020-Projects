U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8868707 Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 2, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), concluding that the Petitioner did not demonstrate his admissibility. The Petitioner filed an appeal from that decision. In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services determines whether a petitioner is inadmissible-and, if so, on what grounds-when adjudicating a U petition, and has the authority to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion. Section 212(d)(14) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(14). A petitioner bears the burden of establishing that they are admissible to the United States or that any applicable ground of inadmissibility has been waived. 8 C.F.R. § 214.l(a)(3)(i). To meet this burden, a petitioner must file a waiver application in conjunction with the U petition, requesting waiver of any grounds of inadmissibility. 8 C.F.R. §§ 212.17, 214.14(c)(2)(iv). The denial of a waiver application is not appealable. 8 C.F.R. § 212.17(b)(3). Although we do not have jurisdiction to review the Director's discretionary denial, we may consider whether the Director's underlying determination of inadmissibility was correct. II. ANALYSIS A full review of the record, including the evidence submitted on appeal, does not establish the Petitioner's eligibility. The appeal will be dismissed for the following reasons. The Petitioner is a citizen of Mexico who claims to have entered the United States without admission, inspection, or parole in May 1997. The record reflects that the Petitioner's criminal history includes:
