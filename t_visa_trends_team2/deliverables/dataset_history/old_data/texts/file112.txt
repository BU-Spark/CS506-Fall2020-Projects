U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8909383 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 22, 2020 The Petitioner, an information technology consulting firm, seeks to employ the Beneficiary temporarily as a "business systems analyst" under the H-lB nonirnrnigrant classification for specialty occupations. 1 The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the petition, concluding in part that the Petitioner did not establish an employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary. While this appeal was pending, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision in Itserve Alliance, Inc. v. Cissna, ---F.Supp.3d ---, 2020 WL 1150186 (D.D.C. 2020). Subsequently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rescinded previously issued policy guidance and directed its officers to apply the existing regulatory definition at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(ii) to assess whether a petitioner and a beneficiary have an employer-employee relationship. 2 The Director also concluded that based on a lack of corroborating material, to include contracts, the Petitioner had not demonstrated it would have qualifying work available for the Beneficiary. The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 3 We review the questions in this matter de novo.4 While we conduct de nova review on appeal, we conclude that a remand is warranted in this case in part based on the new USCIS policy guidance. Within her new decision, the Director may wish to further address the following issues. Within the initial filing, the Petitioner indicated that it would accept a business administration degree as a qualifying prerequisite for the proffered position. Although a general-purpose bachelor's degree, such as a degree in business, may be a legitimate prerequisite for a particular position, requiring such a 1 See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง l 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b). 2 USCIS Policy Memorandum PM-602-0114, Rescission of Policy Memoranda at 2 (June 17, 2020), http://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/policy-memoranda. 3 Section 291 of the Act; Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). 4 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
