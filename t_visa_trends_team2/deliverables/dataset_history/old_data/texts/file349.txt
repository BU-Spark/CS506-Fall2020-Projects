U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9279064 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JULY 23, 2020 Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (Extraordinary Ability-0) The Petitioner, a non-profit Nordic ski club, seeks to classify the Beneficiary, an assistant ski coach, as an alien of extraordinary ability in athletics. To do so, the Petitioner seeks 0-1 nonimmigrant classification, available to aliens who can demonstrate their extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation.
