U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8990261 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 8, 2020 The Petitioner seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a design engineer III under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty ( or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position.

The record demonstrates that the proffered position is a specialty occupation. The Petitioner provided a sufficiently detailed job description and explained the Beneficiary's proposed duties as they relate to the Petitioner's business operations. The proposed duties, when reviewed within the context of the Petitioner's business operations, are sufficient to demonstrate that, more likely than not, the duties of the position require a "body of highly specialized knowledge" attained through a precise and specific course of study that relates directly and closely to the proffered position. The Petitioner also appropriately accounted for the level of experience and responsibility of the position with the certification of the wage level on the labor condition application. Our review of the Beneficiary's academic credentials, the Petitioner's detailed description of the duties and the requirements necessary to perform those duties, as well as evidence of the relationship between
