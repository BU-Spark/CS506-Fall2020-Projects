U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6546789 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for UN onimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 30, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition). The Director concluded that the U petition was not approvable because the record did not establish that the Petitioner was the victim of qualifying criminal activity, and therefore also did not meet the other eligibility requirements. On appeal, the Petitioner asserts his eligibility for U nonimmigrant status. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW To qualify for U-1 nonimmigrant classification, a petitioner must establish that they: have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been the victim of qualifying criminal activity; possess information concerning the qualifying criminal activity; and have been helpful, are being helpful, or are likely to be helpful to law enforcement authorities investigating or prosecuting the qualifying criminal activity. Section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Act. A "victim of qualifying criminal activity" is defined as an individual who has "suffered direct and proximate harm as a result of the commission of qualifying criminal activity." 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(14). "Qualifying criminal activity" is "that involving one or more of' the 26 types of crimes listed at section 10 l(a)(l 5)(U)(iii) of the Act or "any similar activity in violation of Federal, State, or local criminal law." Section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(9). The term "any similar activity" refers to criminal offenses in which the nature and the elements of the offenses are substantially similar to the statutorily enumerated list of criminal activities at section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Act. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(9). U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over U petitions and the petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4); Matter ofChawathe, 25 &N Dec. 369,375 AAO 2010). As a part of meeting this burden, a petitioner must submit a Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Supplement B), from a law enforcement official certifying a petitioner's helpfulness in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity. Section 214(p)(l) of the Act;
