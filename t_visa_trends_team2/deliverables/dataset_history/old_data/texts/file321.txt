U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services InRe: 9437513 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-918, Petition for UN onimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 11, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification under sections I0I(a)(l5)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ l 101(a)(l5)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition). We dismissed the Petitioner's subsequent appeal. He now files a motion to reopen and reconsider, submitting new evidence and arguing that we erred in the decision dismissing his appeal. Upon review, we will dismiss the motions. I. LAW Section 101 ( a)(l 5)(U)(i) of the Act provides U-1 nonimmigrant classification to victims of qualifying crimes who suffer substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of the offense. These victims must also possess information regarding the qualifying crime and be helpful to law enforcement officials in their investigation or prosecution of it. Id. The petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4); Matter ofChawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010).

Although a petitioner may submit any evidence for us to consider, we determine, in our sole discretion, the credibility of and weight given to all of the evidence, including the Supplement B. Section 2 l 4(p )( 4) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4). A motion to reopen must state new facts and be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(2). A motion to reconsider must state the reasons for reconsideration and be supported by any pertinent precedent decisions to establish that the decision was based on an incorrect application of law or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) policy. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(3). The motion to reconsider must also establish that the decision was incorrect based on the evidence of record at the time of the initial decision. Id. We may grant a motion that satisfies these requirements and demonstrates eligibility for the requested immigration benefit. Here, although
