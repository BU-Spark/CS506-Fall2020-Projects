U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8583403 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-129, Petition for L-lA Manager or Executive Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 7, 2020 The Petitioner seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary in the United States as the director of finance and administration of its new office1 under the L-lA nonimmigrant classification for intracompany transferees. Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(L), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(L). The L-lA classification allows a corporation or other legal entity (including its affiliate or subsidiary) to transfer a qualifying foreign employee to the United States to work temporarily in a managerial or executive capacity. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the petition on September 12, 2017, concluding that the Petitioner did not establish that ( 1) the new office will support a managerial or executive position within one year after the approval of the petition; and (2) the Beneficiary has been employed abroad in a managerial or executive capacity. The Director denied an ensuing motion on March 6, 2018. On September 13, 2018, we rejected a subsequent appeal for untimely filing, and we dismissed two additional motions on March 26, 2019, and October 4, 2019. The matter is now before us on a motion to reopen and motion to reconsider. In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. §1361. Upon review, we will dismiss the motion to reopen and the motion to reconsider. I.
