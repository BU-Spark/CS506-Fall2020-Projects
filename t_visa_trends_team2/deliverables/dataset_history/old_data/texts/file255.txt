U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9088685 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 2, 2020 The Petitioner, an information technology company, seeks to extend the Beneficiary's temporary employment as a "programmer analyst" under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 10l(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record did not establish that the position qualifies as a specialty occupation. The matter is now before us on appeal. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records indicate that the Petitioner filed another Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, seeking an extension of H-lB classification on behalf of the Beneficiary and that the petition was approved. Because the Beneficiary has been approved for an extension ofH-lB employment with the Petitioner, further pursuit of the matter at hand is moot. ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
