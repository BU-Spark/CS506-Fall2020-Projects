# Deliverable 1

## dataset = [processed_result.csv](https://github.com/hvarelaf/CS506-Fall2020-Projects/blob/master/t_visa_trends_team2/dataset/processed_result.csv)

By preliminary analysis we found 165 appeals and 23 motions/applications. Also, there are 147 cases dismissed, 2 cases granted, and 0 cases decided. Since the amount of data is small, we will ask the project manager to see if there are more data to use. In the following weeks, we will analyze the data to find trends in the status of these applications by year and the terms used in the decisions.
