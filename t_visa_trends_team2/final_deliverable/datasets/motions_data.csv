The applicant seeks nonimmigrant classification under of the  and Nationality Act (""the Act""), 8  § , as a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons. Procedural History 
The applicant filed this Form I-914 on August 25, 2009. The director subsequently issued a Request for Evidence (RFE) of, inter alia, the applicant's victimization and his resultant presence in the United States. The director [*2] found prior counsel's response to the RFE insufficient to establish the applicant's eligibility and denied the application for failure to establish that the applicant was a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons and was present in the United States on account of such trafficking. On appeal, counsel submitted additional evidence and legal briefs reasserting the applicant's eligibility. 1 
The AAO issued a request for additional evidence (RFE) on October 6, 2011 regarding the applicant's physical presence in the United States on account of his trafficking. Having received no response from counsel, the AAO dismissed the appeal on March 30, 2012, determining that the applicant had established that he was a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, but had not overcome the director's conclusion that he was not physically present in the United States on account of the trafficking. On April 30, 2012, the AAO received a letter from counsel stating that her office had mistakenly sent the RFE [*3] response to the Vermont Service Center rather than the AAO. On May 2, 2011, counsel filed the instant motion to reopen and reconsider with a copy of her RFE response, which included counsel's letter brief, a supplemental statement from the applicant, copies of non-precedent AAO decisions in other T cases and a copy of a December 20, 2011 joint letter from law professors. The AAO reviews these proceedings de novo. 8  § . See also Soltane v. DOJ, 381 F.3d 143, 145 (3d Cir. 2004) . The applicant has still not demonstrated that he is physically present in the United States on account of his trafficking and the appeal will remain dismissed."

As we discussed in our appeal decision, the Applicant’s boyfriend, C-T-,2 subjected her to severe physical, verbal, and sexual abuse beginning in 2000. In 2003, the Applicant went to Mexico to bring her daughter to the United States, returning to C-T- because he threatened to kill her if she left him. After she returned, C-T- said she had to repay him the money he spent for her to go to Mexico, and he forced her to work picking tomatoes to repay the debt. He forced her to work six to seven days per week [*4] from 2003 until 2010, watched her while she worked and yelled at her if she rested or drank water, and would not allow her to leave the house unless she was working or getting groceries. He threatened to beat her and take her children if she did not work, and refused to let her rest even when she was in pain or felt ill due to working in high heat. When she begged for time off: he hit her in the nose and caused it to bleed, burned her arm with a tortilla griddle, and threw plates and food at her. He also took half of her salary each week, leaving her without enough to feed her three children, and said she must provide for him or he would take the children away. Further, he threatened that she would be deported if she reported him and that if she left him, he would find and kill her and her children. The Applicant finally escaped in 2010, when she sought medical feared C-T- would harm her in Mexico, was receiving services for trafficking victims in the United States, and was struggling financially. However, we concluded that the Applicant did not claim that she had ongoing contact with C-T- or had reason to believe she would fall under his control again, did not establish that her present financial hardship was directly related to her past trafficking, and did not indicate that she was suffering ongoing physical or emotional harm resulting from the trafficking that continued to adversely affect her life.

LEXIS 22751,no,"A. Not a Victim of a Severe Form of Trafficking [*3] in Persons In our prior decision on appeal, incorporated here by reference, we found the Applicant had not demonstrated that he was a victim of a severe form of trafficking by [redacted] as he maintained. Specifically, we concluded although the Applicant showed he was recruited and obtained for employment with [redacted] he had not established he was recruited or obtained through force, fraud, or coercion and for the purpose of subjecting him to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery as required by section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I) of the Act and the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a). 1  Our review indicated that despite the Applicants claim that he was given a position other than the one promised to him in his employment agreement, the agreement itself only identified the employment category in which he was to be employed and did not specify the position. The record also showed that the Applicant was compensated at an hourly rate above the rate set forth in his employment contract [*4] and was given overtime hours at an even higher rate. Accordingly, we held that the Applicant had not established that [redacted] fraudulently obtained and recruited him for his labor services or that [redacted] intended to subject, or had subjected. him to involuntary servitude as he maintained below. We further concluded that the Applicant had not shown that [redacted] used coercion in recruiting or obtaining his labor services. We noted that the Applicant provided no probative details to support his assertion that [redacted] agent. D-Z-, 2  threatened him should he leave [redacted] and did not establish that [redacted] otherwise physically restricted or monitored his movements, harmed him, or used threats of harm, physical restraint, or legal process to retain his labor services. On motion, the Applicant submits a supplemental statement and an unsigned copy of his affidavit that is nearly identical to one previously proffered below. The Applicant provides no additional or 1 Footnote 1. The Department of Homeland Security issued an interim rule, effective January 18, 2017, amending its regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11 for victims of human trafficking who seek T nonimmigrant status. See Classification for Victims of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons; Eligibility for ""T"" Nonimmigrant Status (Interim T Rule), 81 Fed. Reg. 92266. 92308-09 (Dec. 19, 2016). Accordingly, we cite to the pertinent T regulations, as amended by the Interim T Rule, throughout this decision here. 2 [*12] Footnote 2. Initials are used to protect individuals identities. 2017 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 22751, *2  substantive [*5] information with respect to his claim of trafficking by [redacted] and makes no assertions of legal or factual error in our prior decision. Instead, the Applicant indicates that after leaving [redacted] employment in May 2008 and finishing another H-2B employment in December 2008. he fell victim to another labor trafficking scheme by [redacted] headed by N-Y-, through whom he requested an extension of his H-2B visa. He indicated that something went wrong and his H-2B visa extension request by [redacted] was not granted. The Applicant stated that he learned from a friend years later that N-Yhad been operating [redacted] illegally and providing fake FI-2B documents to clients, including the Applicant. He submits emails with N-Y- discussing the fees and other matters related to his H-2B extension. The facts asserted on motion indicate that the Applicant may have been a victim of a fraud scheme by [redacted] and N-Y-. However, they do not establish that the Applicant was a victim of trafficking, as the record does not show that [redacted] or N-Y- recruited or obtained him for labor services and that they did so with the intention of subjecting him to involuntary [*6] servitude. Although the Applicant makes a general assertion that N-Y- ""did some recruitment and coercion"" by threatening not to process his application if the Applicant did not work for him, he provided no probative details about any proffered employment or any specific incidents in which the alleged threats were made, and he does not allege that N-Y- successfully recruited or obtained him for labor services. To the contrary, emails between the Applicant and N-Y- proffered on motion confirm that the Applicant retained N-Y-s services solely for the purpose of filing an H-2B extension request on his behalf and that [redacted] and N-Y- were not tasked with obtaining employment for the Applicant, because the Applicant intended to find his own H-2B employer. The record therefore does not establish that [redacted] and N-Y- recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained the Applicant for labor or services, and that they did so for the purpose of subjecting him to involuntary servitude. Consequently, the Applicant is not a victim of a severe form of trafficking by [redacted] and N-Y-, as that term is defined at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a).  B. Physical Presence in the [*7] United States on Account of Trafficking In our previous decision, we also found that because the Applicant had not established that he is the victim of a severe form of human trafficking, he consequently could not show that he is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking as required by section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(lI) of the Act. We further found that even if he had established his victimization, the record still did not demonstrate his physical presence in the United States was on account of such trafficking, as he escaped the claimed trafficking many years before in 2008 and has not shown that his ""continuing presence in the United States is directly related to the original trafficking."" 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(g)(1)(i), (iii), and (iv). On appeal, the Applicant reasserts his same claim that he did not return to the Philippines after leaving his trafficking situation because of a large outstanding loan his family borrowed from a bank and friends. He also adds that the low wages in the Philippines would make it difficult for him to pay the loan off if he returned there. We previously addressed this claim on appeal, and the Applicant has not provided any [*8] new factual or legal assertions to overcome our prior findings and he has not cited any pertinent authority to demonstrate that we incorrectly applied the law in our prior decision. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(3). We note also that the Applicant has not provided any corroborating evidence of his loans, including bank loan papers, to support his assertion, nor has he explained why such evidence is unavailable. Accordingly, the Applicant has not demonstrated that he is physically present in the United States on account of a severe form of trafficking persons. 2017 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 22751, *12  C. Assistance in the Investigation or Prosecution of Acts of Trafficking On appeal, we also concluded that the Applicant not established his compliance with any reasonable request for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of acts of trafficking or the investigation of associated crime, as he had not contacted a law enforcement agency regarding acts of a severe form of trafficking in persons and was not otherwise exempted from this requirement due to any physical or psychological trauma he suffered or because he is under 18 years of age. Section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(III) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.11(h)(1), (h)(4).  [*9] On motion, the Applicant again acknowledges that he has never contacted law enforcement officials regarding his claim of trafficking by [redacted] and by [redacted] He reiterates the same general claims he previously made that shame, trauma, and fear of arrest and deportation prevented him from reporting his trafficking to authorities. He alleges that the trauma of his trafficking situation had led to anxietydisorders, depression, and suicidal tendencies, and that his traffickers made him mistrust the authorities by threatening him with arrest, deportation, and other harm. However, as with his prior statements, the Applicant provides no substantive information regarding his claim of trauma and emotional harm and makes no reference to the nature and impact of the claimed trauma on his daily life. Further, as we previously noted, his general assertions of trauma are unsupported in the record and are in contrast to his assertions below that he established close community and personal ties and successfully maintained long term employment in the United States in the years after escaping the alleged trafficking.  D. Extreme Hardship Involving Unusual and Severe Harm upon Removal [*10] On motion, the Applicant has also not overcome our prior determination that he has not demonstrated that he would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States. He makes the same general claims of social, religious, and economic hardships and asserts again that it would be difficult to rebuild his life and that he would be in danger as a Judeo-Christian in the Philippines given ongoing conflict between Muslims and Christians there. We have fully addressed these claims in our previous decision and the Applicant makes no new legal or factual assertions in support of his hardship claim."

Not a Victim of a Severe Form of Trafficking in [*4] Persons The record indicates that Applicant obtained entry into the United States with the assistance of smugglers. He maintains that he is eligible for T classification because at some point during the course of the smuggling scheme after his entry, a trafficking situation arose when his smugglers subjected him to involuntary servitude by coercing him into carrying and transporting backpacks purportedly containing drugs. In our prior decision on appeal, we concluded that the Applicants suspicions were not sufficient to establish that the backpacks contained illegal drugs and his claim that he was forced to carry the backpacks for a few days for the last part of their journey did not establish that a trafficking situation arose during the smuggling operation. We also found that the record did not establish that the smugglers actually used or threatened to use physical restraint or injury, or that they abused or threatened abuse of legal process, to coerce the Applicant into carrying the backpacks. In addition, we noted a discrepancy in the Applicants statement to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers who encountered him after the smugglers left him. and his statement [*5] in these proceedings regarding the duration of his  travels from his native Guatemala to the time of his U.S. entry. 2018 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 1015, *2 On motion, the Applicant asserts that we erred by not considering the totality of the evidence and by requiring him to establish with certainty that he was forced to carry backpacks that actually contained illegal drugs. Contrary to the Applicants assertion, we considered all the relevant evidence in the record, of which the primary evidence of the Applicants trafficking claim was his statements below. However, absent probative testimony demonstrating that the smugglers transported or harbored the Applicant through the use of fraud, force, or coercion for the purpose of involuntary servitude, the Applicants claim that he was forced to carry backpacks, which may or may not have contained illegal drugs, was  insufficient to establish that a trafficking situation arose. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a)1  (defining the term severe form of trafficking [*6] in persons). The Applicant contends, however, that his statements specifically stated that the smugglers were armed and threatened to abandon him and others in the middle of nowhere if they did not carry the backpacks. The Applicant contends that these actions and threats by the smugglers demonstrated that they used or threatened to use physical restraint or injury to coerce him into carrying the backpacks. In his brief on motion, counsel for the Applicant adds that the smugglers threatened him with injury. The record indicates that the Applicant did state that the smugglers threatened to abandon him if he did not carry the backpacks, and that he complied because he feared being left behind. However, notwithstanding counsels assertion that the smugglers threatened the Applicant with injury, the Applicants multiple statements did not allege that the smugglers actually threatened to use physical restraint or to harm him to force his compliance when they ordered him to carry the backpacks. In our decision, we acknowledged the Applicants assertion that there was an implied threat because the smugglers were armed and displayed weapons, as well as his recollection of an incident [*7] during the journey where the smugglers beat his cousin ""for getting to[sic] close to the road"" and putting the group at risk to exposure. We further acknowledge that the smugglers actions constituted coercion. as that term is defined at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a), because they used ""threats of serious harm"" to the Applicant and engaged  in behavior that was intended to cause him to believe that failure to comply with their orders would result in serious harm to him. However, the record does not demonstrate that the smugglers transported and harbored him, during the smuggling operation, for the purpose of subjecting him to involuntary servitude. Rather, as we previously found, the Applicants account of his claimed trafficking indicated that the smugglers purpose in engaging in these abusive tactics was to avoid detection from immigration authorities in the area near the border as they carried out their illegal smuggling operation. His statements indicated that although the smugglers facilitated his entry into the United States, they had not yet reached their final destination at the time the smugglers demanded that he and others carry backpacks [*8] during the next part of the journey. Thus, although the smugglers forced the Applicant to perform some labor, the record indicates that the smugglers transported and harbored him for the purpose of taking him to the United States as per the conditions of their agreement with the Applicant. The Applicants claim that he never agreed to perform such labor when he entered into an agreement with the smugglers beforehand is not sufficient to establish that the smugglers transported or harbored him for the purpose of subjecting him to involuntary servitude. Although we recognize that smugglers may have multiple criminal motives during a smuggling operation. 1 Footnote 1. The Department of Homeland Security issued an interim rule, effective January 18, 2017, amending its regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11 for victims of human trafficking who seek T nonimmigrant status. See Classification for Victims of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons; Eligibility for ""T"" Nonimmigrant Status (Interim T Rule), 81 Fed. Reg 92266, 92308-09 (Dec. 19, 2016) . 2018 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 1015, *5 including trafficking of individuals they agreed to smuggle, the present record does not establish that individuals who smuggled the Applicant into the United States transported or harbored him for the purpose of involuntary servitude. On motion, the Applicant also submits a brief letter from his cousin, W-C-, 2  who asserted that he wassmuggled with [*9] the Applicant and was also forced to carry the backpacks. The one-page letter is not dated or notarized, and is not accompanied by any identity documents. 3  Additionally, although the Applicants statements below indicated that two of his cousins were smuggled with him. he never identified either of them by name. W-C- briefly indicates that the smugglers selected the Applicant and him, as well as some others, to carry backpacks that supposedly contained medicine and energy drinks, but which he believed contained drugs. However, although W-C- indicates that the smugglers threatened to leave them behind if they opened the backpacks, he did not state that they threatened the Applicant and him with physical restraint or harm to force or coerce them to carry the backpacks. Additionally, while the Applicant specifically recalled that the smugglers beat one of his cousins while carrying the backpacks, W-C- did not reference the incident. The Applicant further asserts we erred in finding that a discrepancy [*10] in his statement to the CBP officers with his statement in these proceedings below undermined his overall trafficking claim. The Applicants statements to CBP indicated that he began his journey from Guatemala to the United States in [redacted] 2013 and that it took approximately 13 days. With his T application, however, the Applicant claimed that he left his home and started his journey several months before in March 2013. On motion, counsel for the Applicant notes that the Applicant was only 15 years of age at the time of his encounter with CBP and identified other factors, including inadvertent error on the part of the Applicant or the interviewing officer, all of which he maintains could account for the inconsistency in the Applicants statement to CBP. In addition, counsel submits part of an article discussing unaccompanied minors and concluding that CBP officers who interview such minors generally received inadequate training to work with children and identify indicators that a child was a victim of trafficking. In light of this background, counsel maintains we should have considered that the interviewing CBP officer failed to document the Applicants account of his claim [*11] accurately, particularly as he has been consistent in these roceedings. However, the assertions of counsel do not constitute evidence. Matter of Obaigbena, 19 I&N Dec. 533, 534 n.2 (BIA 1988) (citing Matter of Ramirez-Sanchez, 17 I&N Dec. 503, 506 (BIA 1980)) . Counsels statements must be substantiated in the record with independent evidence, which may include affidavits and declarations. Here, although we recognize that there are a number of reasons that may account for discrepancies in an individuals statements, the Applicant has not himself identified which of his statements regarding the timeline of his journey is accurate nor has he provided his own explanation on motion for the discrepancy raised in our previous decision. The Applicant, who bears the burden of proof in these proceedings, therefore has not overcome this referenced discrepancy. Regardless, as discussed, the Applicant has not otherwise established that the smugglers who transported and harbored him did so for the purpose of subjecting him to involuntary servitude. He therefore has not established that he is a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons.  B. Extreme Hardship Involving [*12] Unusual and Severe Harm upon Removal 2 Footnote 2. Initials used to protect individuals privacy. 3 Footnote 3. According [*16] to the Applicant, following the CBP encounter, officials separated him from his cousins and the rest of the  group because the Applicant was under 18 years of age. 2018 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 1015, *8 The Applicant also has not overcome our determination that he had not established that he would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States under the standard and factors prescribed at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(i) and as required by section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(IV) of  he Act. In our previous decision, we determined that although the Applicant asserted generally that he is  fearful of gangs in Guatemala and of gang recruitment and submitted background country conditions articles addressing the subject, his statements lacked any probative testimony regarding his claimed fear and did not establish how the background materials related to his own personal circumstances. On motion, counsel, citing background material submitted on appeal and on motion, again discusses the country conditions in Guatemala and how such conditions motivated the Applicants decision to come to  the United States, in addition to economic and educational factors. Counsel also asserts new facts and contends that the Applicant suffered trauma as a result of trafficking, in addition to other [*13] trauma from other experiences in his personal and family life. Counsel maintains that the Applicant is now enrolled in school in the United States, has the support of his family and community, and is slowly healing. Counsel asserts that returning to Guatemala would hinder the Applicants recovery, as well as deprive him of many basic rights, including access to medical care, education, and social services. However, as stated, unsubstantiated assertions of counsel do not constitute evidence. Obaigkena, 19 I&N Dec. at 534 n.2 . As set forth in our previous decision, the Applicants statements below lacked probative testimony regarding the personal circumstances of his life in Guatemala, the trauma he claims to have suffered there and during his travel to the United States, and hardship he would face were he to depart the United States. Absent such probative testimony, the record does not establish that the Applicant would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States.  C. Remaining Eligibility Criteria An applicant for T classification must establish that he or she is present in the United States on account of having been [*14] a victim of a severe form of trafficking and that he or she complied with any reasonable requests from law enforcement for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of such trafficking, as required by sections 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(II) and (III) of the Act. As the Applicant here has not  demonstrated that he is a victim of a severe form of trafficking as required, the Applicant necessarily did not establish that he was physically present in the United States on account of trafficking and that he complied with LEA requests for assistance as the Act requires."

LEXIS 8460,no,"The Applicant asserted on appeal that she was ""trafficked by fraud for the purpose of involuntary [*3] servitude and slavery as a domestic and sexual servant… [and] retained by the perpetrator by force and coercion."" The term ""involuntary servitude"" is defined, in pertinent part, as: a condition of servitude induced by means of any scheme, plan, or pattern intended to cause a person to believe that, if the person did not enter into or continue in such condition, that person or another person would suffer serious harm or physical restraint; or a condition of servitude induced by the abuse or threatened abuse of legal process. Involuntary servitude includes a condition of servitude in which the victim is forced to work for the defendant by the use or threat of physical restraint or physical injury, or by the use or threat of coercion through the law or the legal process. This definition encompasses those cases in which the defendant holds the victim in servitude by placing the victim in fear of such physical restraint or injury or legal coercion. 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a). 1 An applicant seeking to demonstrate that he or she was a victim of a severe form of trafficking for labor or services must show: (1) that he or she was recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained for his or her labor or services, (2) through the use of force, fraud, or coercion, (3) for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage or slavery. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a) (defining the term severe forms of trafficking in persons"" for T nonimmigrant classification). Thus, an applicant must show both the particular ""means"" used (force, fraud, or coercion) and that such means was used for a particular ""end"" - namely for the purpose of subjecting the applicant to involuntary servitude, peonage, or debt bondage. In our prior decision we determined that the Applicant has demonstrated that F- 2  brought her to the United States through the use of fraud by promising to marry her when he was already married [*5] to 1 Footnote 1.

We concluded, however, that the Applicant had not established that F- transported her to the United States for the purpose of subjecting her to involuntary servitude as defined under 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a). In reaching this conclusion, we found that counsel for the Applicant asserted in the appeal brief that F- forced the Applicant to engage in domestic work, but the Applicant did not describe such a situation in her own statement. In regard to the Applicants assertion that F- recruited and harbored her for the purpose of subjecting her to involuntary servitude in the form of sexual services, we determined that the evidence showed that F- subjected the Applicant to severe and ongoing domestic violence and sexual abuse, but the Applicant indicated that she voluntarily departed for Mexico in 2014 and the evidence did not establish that the Applicant believed that she must ""enter into or continue in [the] condition"" in which she lived during her relationship with F-. as defined by the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a):. We also found that the Applicant did not establish that she was subjected [*6] to slavery as that term is commonly defined because her travel to Mexico in 2014 shows that she was not under F-s complete control. 3  Lastly, we determined that the record does not show that the threats that F- made to call the police on the Applicant and his attempt to seek full custody of their child were done as a means to subject the Applicant to a condition of servitude. On motion, the Applicant asserts that F- had control over her movement and he frequently had her travel with him to Mexico. She claims that our characterization of her travel in 2014 as an independent and personal decision is incorrect because she did not have any means for traveling independently to Mexico. In the supplemental affidavit the Applicant submits on motion, she writes. ""[h]e would force me to go to Mexico … He would have me leave the country about 6 or 8 times. The last time was June 10. 2015. He would pay for the trips and plan them by himself… he would drive me to and from Mexico."" However, this description [*7] is inconsistent with the statement she wrote in her first affidavit. In her first affidavit, the Applicant recounted: If I ever tried to express myself, he mocked me and told me to shut up. We argued a lot because of this and he often threw me out of the house. When this happened, he paid for me to return to Mexico. Then he would come back to [redacted] and make me go back with him, and again paid for the travel. In 2014 I left him and returned to [redacted] He followed me there and begged me to come back. He promised that we would have a ""dream ranch"" and a business together in Mexico. I was convinced that he would change, so I went. After that, he took my border crossing card so I could not leave again. This statement indicates that the Applicant and F- had a pattern or cycle in their relationship where they argued and F- would pay for her return to Mexico and then he would travel to Mexico to ask her to return. She differentiated her departure to Mexico in 2014 by stating that she ""left him and returned to [redacted] and only returned to the United States after F- promised that they would have a ranch and businesstogether. The record, therefore, does not [*8] demonstrate an error in our prior conclusion that the Applicants decision to voluntarily depart the United States in 2014 shows that she did not believe that she must enter into or continue in the condition in which she lived during her relationship with F- and that she was not under F-s complete control.  3 Footnote 3. Slavery is not defined in the Act or regulations, but is understood as ""a situation in which one person has absolute power over the life, fortune, and liberty of another."" Blacks Law Dictionary (B. A. Garner, ed.) (10th ed. 2014). 2018 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 8460, *5 The Applicant asserts that even if we do not find that she was trafficked because she voluntarily departed the United States, the record shows that she was subjected to trafficking after her 2014 reentry to the United States, which is when F- took her border crossing card. She asserts that she was rescued from the claimed trafficking in [redacted] 2015 after she went to a domestic violence shelter. However, the record contains a copy of the Applicants Form I-94 card, which shows that she was last admitted to the United States as a B-2 nonimmigrant visitor in June 2015. She does not discuss this departure and reentry in her first affidavit and in her second affidavit she only states that F- had her leave the United States ""6 or 8 times"" with the June 2015 trip as her last departure. The Applicant does not describe in her affidavits the two months between her June 2015 [*9] reentry into the United States and her [redacted] 2015 stay at a domestic violence shelter to demonstrate that she was subjected to force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of involuntary servitude during this period. She further asserts that she believed that she would suffer serious harm or physical restraint if she did not remain in the state of servitude. As discussed in our prior decision, the record shows that F- subjected the Applicant to severe and ongoing domestic violence and sexual abuse, but it does not establish that the Applicant believed that she must ""enter into or continue in [the] condition"" in which she lived during her relationship with F-, as defined by 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(a), because the Applicant voluntarily departed the United States and traveled to Mexico in 2014. Although the Applicant claims that we can consider the trafficking to have started with her last entry into the United States, the Applicant does not provide any specific, probative details on her relationship with F- from [redacted] 2015 until she moved into a domestic violence shelter two months later. The Applicant also argues that F- abused [*10] the legal process by threatening that she would be arrested if she called the police and violating the restraining order the Applicant had against him. The Applicant submits a copy of a three-year criminal protective order restraining F- from having contact with her, a copy of a subpoena for her to testify in a criminal proceeding, and photographs of her injuries, which she states were used as evidence during the protective order hearing. As we stated in our prior decision, the record does not indicate that F- threatened to falsely report the Applicant to the police or other law enforcement authorities when they resided together in order to induce her into. servitude. Although the record shows that F- violated the protective order by contacting the Applicant, these incidents occurred after the Applicant went to the domestic violence shelter and was no longer living with F-. The record does not demonstrate that the Applicant was recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained by Fafter she entered the domestic violence shelter. Therefore, the record does not indicate that F- abused the custody or any other legal proceedings to subject her to servitude. Finally, the Applicant [*11] asserts that she is also a victim of sex trafficking. She previously stated that she was a victim of sexual slavery, which we addressed in our prior decision as a form of trafficking for services. Sex trafficking on the other hand is defined as ""the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act."" 8 CF.R. § 214.11(a). Commercial sex act means ""any sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any person."" Id. The commercial sex act must be ""induced by force, fraud, or coercion."" Id. The Applicant asserts that F- subjected her to forced sex ""in exchange for the money he provided her at any time."" Although the record shows that F- sexually assaulted the Applicant and had financial control over her as part of the cycle of violence in his attempt to exert his power and control her. it does not show that he recruited, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, patronized, or solicited her for t he purpose of a commercial sex act. 2018 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 8460, *8 The Applicant in her first statement described F-s sexual abuse and financial control [*12] over her as: He paid for all the bills and I had no access to money. When he got mad at me. he turned off the internet, television, and phone lines to make me pay for whatever I did that upset him; I had to beg for money for groceries and laundry. I wasnt allowed to drive his car unless he directed me to do so. He forced me to have sex with him whenever he wanted. … He forced me to give him oral sex whenever he wanted, or any other kind of sex. This statement shows that F- subjected the Applicant to an ongoing cycle of violence that involved psychological, physical, and sexual abuse of her, but it does not show that she was forced to perform a sex act in exchange for money or anything else of value. However, in her new affidavit submitted on motion the Applicant wrote that: If 1 ever used the money for myself he would say, ""how are you going to pay me back?"" and he would always mean I would pay in a sexual way. Whatever he wanted to do to me sexually in order to pay him back. When it came to sex, he never asked me if I wanted to. He would just climb on top of me. The Applicant claims that she did not previously disclose this information because she suffered [*13] from impaired memory related to her PTSD, depression, and anxiety. However, her new statement does not contain a detailed, probative account of her claim that she was subjected to forced sex in exchange for money. Without such details, the Applicants description is insufficient as evidence of her new claim that she was a victim of sex trafficking. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(d)(5) (an applicant may submit any credible  evidence for us to consider in our de novo review; however, we determine, in our sole discretion, the evidentiary value to give that evidence). In sum. the record does not establish that F- recruited, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained the Applicant for her labor or services for the purpose of subjecting her to involuntary servitude or slavery. The record also does not show that the Applicant was the victim of sex trafficking through F-s recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of her for the purpose of a commercial sex act. Consequently, the Applicant has not established that she is the victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons as required by section 101(a)(l5)(T)(i)(I) [*14] of the Act. As the record does not demonstrate that the Applicant was the victim of a severe form of human trafficking, she consequently cannot show that she is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking and that she complied with any reasonable requests from law enforcement for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the trafficking, as required by subsections 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(II),(III) of the Act."

On appeal, we determined that the .Applicant established that she was a victim of trafficking, that acts of trafficking occurred in the United .States, and that she assisted law enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of the trafficking; .however,",2018 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 11253,no,"In our prior decision, incorporated here by reference, we concluded that the Applicant did not demonstrate that she was physically present in the United States on account of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(II) of the Act requires. Upon review, the Applicant has overcome this [*4] determination. 
In determining the physical presence requirement, USCIS must consider a T applicant's presence in the United States at the time the application is filed. 8  § . The physical presence requirement reaches an applicant who, at the time of filing: (1) is currently being subjected to trafficking; (2) was liberated from trafficking by a law enforcement agency (LEA); (3) escaped from trafficking before an LEA was involved; (4) was subject to trafficking in the past and his or her continued presence in the United States is directly related to such trafficking; or (5) was allowed to enter the United States to participate in investigative or judicial processes related to the trafficking. 8 §§  . 
We previously determined that because the Applicant was the victim of trafficking in the past and escaped her trafficker without LEA involvement, she potentially fell within the scenarios set forth in 8 C.F.R. and (iv), either as an applicant who escaped [*5] trafficking before an LEA became involved or as one who was trafficked in the past and whose continuing presence was directly related to the original trafficking, respectively. We then determined, based on the record before us, that she had not established that she was physically present under 8 , as more than six years had passed since she escaped the trafficking and she had not provided substantive details about her trauma, explained why she was unable to return to Honduras, or established that she remained 
under the control of her traffickers. 
In her NOID response, the Applicant asserts that she is physically present on account of trafficking under 8    , as an individual who escaped a severe form of trafficking in persons before an LEA was involved, because a law enforcement agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement- Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI), was involved in the investigation of the trafficking crimes of which she was a victim. The Applicant notes that, while the term ""involved"" is not defined in the regulations, in [*6] a recent non-precedent decision (NPD), we interpreted the term to require more than passive receipt by law enforcement of a report of trafficking. She distinguishes her claim by arguing that ICE-HSI was involved in her case because she was interviewed by ICE- HSI, provided them with further documentation, remained in touch, and reiterated her willingness to provide assistance. Although our NPDs do not have precedential authority and we consider each case individually, the Applicant is correct that ""involved"" within the meaning of 8   requires more than de minimis involvement by law enforcement, and that the record establishes that ICE-HSI was involved in the investigation of the acts of trafficking of which she was a victim. The record shows that, after receiving a referral from the [redacted] Michigan police, ICE-HSI interviewed the Applicant regarding her trafficking claim in May 2013, and that, following the interview, the Applicant's counsel provided additional documentation to ICE-HSI and repeated that the Applicant was willing to provide further assistance. The record further shows that in August 2013, [*7] ICE-HSI informed the Applicant's counsel that the notes from the interview would remain on file in case the perpetrator, who was in Mexico, was apprehended. The Applicant filed her T application the following year. The record therefore demonstrates that there was LEA involvement, as required by 8 . 
The Applicant further argues that she is not barred from establishing that she is physically present in the United States on account of trafficking by 8 , which states that an individual who has voluntarily departed or been removed from the United States may not establish physical presence under 8     , unless the individual's reentry into the United States was the result of continued victimization, the individual is the victim of a new incident of trafficking, or he or she has been allowed reentry [*8] into the United States to participate in investigative or judicial processes related to the trafficking. 8  § . Here, the record shows that the Applicant was a victim of acts of trafficking that originated in the United States, during which time she was forcibly transported to Mexico. She did not voluntarily depart the United States and was not removed from the United States after the conclusion of the acts of trafficking. Accordingly, she is not barred from demonstrating her physical presence by 8 . 
In sum, as the Applicant has established that she escaped her trafficking before an LEA was involved, that there was LEA involvement, and that she is not precluded from establishing her physical presence on account of trafficking by 8   section (g)(2), the Applicant has demonstrated that she is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking. As such, we withdraw our prior determination that she is ineligible for T nonimmigrant status because she did not establish her physical presence. [*9]"

In a decision dated January 29, 2018, the Immigration Judge denied the respondent’s motions to reopen and stay removal. The Immigration Judge certified the case back to the Board. The respondent now proffers evidence that he has been granted a nonimmigrant T visa by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and he requests that the Board dismiss his appeal as moot. 
The respondent’s motion to dismiss his appeal as moot relies on a federal regulation that stated “[i]f the Service grants an application for T nonimmigrant status, the final order [of removal] shall be deemed canceled by operation of law as of the date of the approval.” 8    . Effective January 18, 2017, that regulation was superseded by a regulation which provides that an applicant who is the subject of a removal order “may seek cancellation of such order by filing a motion to reopen [*2] and terminate proceedings with the immigration judge or the Board. ICE may agree, as a matter of discretion, to join such motion to overcome any applicable time and numerical limitations of 8   and 1003.23.” See81 Fed.

or parole with her mother in August 2015, [*2] when she was one year of age. In her statements in the
record before the Director, the Applicantâs mother explained that she and the Applicant travelled to the
United States with the assistance of smugglers, who ultimately stopped in the desert and told them that
they would not accompany them any further and that they should continue walking until they reached a
city. The Applicantâs mother stated that, as she and the Applicant continued to walk, they encountered a
group of four men who told them that they would have to pay to pass by them. The Applicantâs mother
explained that she gave the men all the money that she had in her possession but, believing that she had
more money, the men forced the Applicantâs mother and the Applicant to remove their clothing. In their
search for more money, the men sexually assaulted the Applicant and subsequently raped the Applicantâs
mother. The Applicantâs mother last stated that, after raping her, the men showed them a path they could
follow to reach immigration authorities. The Applicant filed the instant T application in January 2017.

An applicant may be classified as a T-1 nonimmigrant if she: is or has been a victim of a severe form of
trafficking [*3] in persons; is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; has
complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking; and
would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States.
Section 101(a)(15)(T)@ of the Act; 8 C.F.R. Â§ 214.11(b)(1)-(4). âSevere form of trafficking in personsâ is
defined as, most relevantly, âsex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is inducedâ and âthe person
induced to perform such act is under the age of 18 years[.]â 8 CFR. Â§ 2/4.///(a). In turn, âsex traffickingâ
means âthe recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or soliciting of a
person for the purpose of a commercial sex act,â id., and âcommercial sex actâ is defined as âany sex act
on account of which anything or value is given to or received by any person.â 22 U.S.C. Â§ 7/02(4); 8

CFR. Â§ 214.11 (a).

The burden of proof is on the applicant to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. &
CER. Â§ 214.11(d) (35); Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). An applicant may submit
any credible evidence for us to consider; [*4] however, we determine, in our sole discretion, the

evidentiary value given to it. 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.11(d)(5).

In our prior decision on appeal, incorporated here by reference, we acknowledged that the Applicant was
the unfortunate victim of a sexual assault, but found that the record did not establish that she was
subjected to a severe form of trafficking in persons, as required by the Act and relevant regulations.
Specifically, we found that the evidence did not show that the Applicant was recruited, harbored,
transported, provided, obtained, patronized, or solicited for the purpose of a commercial sex act, as the
record indicated that the sexual assault of the Applicant was not on account of or in exchange for anything
of value; rather, the record indicated that the perpetrators robbed the Applicantâs mother, sexually
assaulted the Applicant in their search for more money, raped the Applicantâs mother, and then provided
the Applicantâs mother with directions. Relatedly, we noted that, although the record indicated a possible
shift in the perpetratorsâ purpose from a robbery to the rape of the Applicantâs mother, it did not indicate
that the perpetrators at any time recruited, harbored, [*5] transported, provisioned, obtained, patronized,
or solicited the Applicant for the purpose of a commercial sex act. We last concluded that, because the
record did not establish that the Applicant was a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, she
necessarily could not establish that she was present in the United States on account of such trafficking,
likewise required by the Act and relevant regulations.On motion to reconsider, the Applicant argues that the record establishes that a commercial sex act
occurred as contemplated by $_C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.//(a). She asserts that our prior decision âimproperly
distorted [the] Applicantâs claim by finding that nothing of value was exchanged for the sex actâ when,
âin reality, the [perpetrators] chose to pay for the commission of their forced sex act through an intangible
payment of the giving of directions.â

As a preliminary matter, we acknowledge that our prior decision on appeal somewhat conflated the
requirements of the regulation defining commercial sex act, requiring both an underlying exchange in
value and that the exchange in value have occurred âon account ofâ the sex act. SeeS C.F.R_ Â§ 2/4.11(q@)
(defining âcommercial sex actâ as [*6] âany sex act on account of which anything or value is given to or
received by any person.â). In this case, we do not dispute the Applicantâs assertion that the perpetratorsâ
giving of directions was of value to her and her mother; instead, and as discussed in detail below, we find
that the record does not establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the perpetratorsâ giving of
directions was on account of the sexual assault of the Applicant.

In her initial personal statement submitted with the Applicantâs T application, the Applicantâs mother
recounted the perpetrators robbing her of money, âtouching [the Applicant] ... to see if they could feel
any money[,]â and subsequently raping her. The Applicantâs motherâs updated statement submitted in
response to a request for evidence (RFE) from the Director clarified that, as the perpetrators sexually
assaulted the Applicant, they âwere asking [the Applicantâs mother] if [she] had hid money on [the
Applicant].â The Applicantâs mother additionally explained that the perpetrators âtold [her] that if [she]
did not have more money they would still show [her] the way but they would do what they wanted to
[her].â She last stated that, after [*7] the Applicant was sexually assaulted and she was raped, the
perpetrators âtold [her] where to goâ and âwere satisfied with their payment and so ... decided to let [her
and the Applicant] pass.â

While the Applicantâs motherâs statements may indicate some connection between the perpetratorsâ
having raped her and their having subsequently provided her with directions, the relevant inquiry in this
case concerns whether the perpetrators provided the Applicantâs mother with directions on account of the
sexual assault of the Applicant herself. The Applicantâs motherâs statements, however, directly tie the
sexual assault of the Applicant to the perpetratorsâ search for money and indicate only her subjective
belief as to what transpired in their minds after her rapeâthey do not establish, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the perpetratorsâ gave the Applicantâs mother directions on account of, or the Applicantâs
mother received directions as a result of, the Applicantâs sexual assault. SeeS_C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.]] (a) (defining
âcommercial sex actâ as âany sex act on account of which anything of value is given to or received by any
personâ). Instead, and as stated in our decision on appeal, the record [*8] indicates that the Applicant was
the unfortunate victim of a sexual assault during, and in furtherance of, a robbery.

The Applicant additionally asserts that our decision âerred by stating that the Applicant need[ed] to show
that the [perpetratorsâ] conscious object was to engage in commercial sex actsâ and âpurposely gave
directions ... as a thing of value to be exchanged for the sex act[,]â stating that the perpetratorsâ mental
state is inconsequential because the definition of a commercial sex act pays no regard to oneâs intent or
motive for acting. The Applicant similarly asserts that our decision âincorrectly analyzed whether the
[perpetrator]âs purpose was to subject the Applicant to a commercial sex actâ when we âshould have
analyzed whether the obtaining, harboring, transporting, providing, patronizing, or soliciting of [the]
Applicant was for the purpose of a commercial sexual act.â However, this argument mischaracterizes our
findings. Our decision on appeal did not imply any required mental state of the perpetrators, as the mental state of acting âpurposelyâ for criminal purposes is irrelevant to, and distinct from, the eligibility criteria
at issue here; instead, it requiredâconsistent [*9] with the plain language of the relevant regulationsâ
that the record establish, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the Applicant was recruited, harbored,
transported, provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited âfor the purpose of a commercial sex act.â &

CER. Â§ 2/4.11(a). Borrowing from the analysis above, however, the record did not establish, by a
preponderance of the evidence, that a commercial sex act occurred, nor did it indicate that the perpetrators
recruited, harbored, transported, provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited the Applicant for the
purpose of one.!

Il. CONCLUSION

The Applicant was the unfortunate victim of a sexual assault as she traveled to the United States with her
mother. However, [*10] the Applicantâs evidence and assertions on motion do not overcome our prior
determination or establish error in that decision. Consequently, her motion to reconsider is dismissed."

entered the United States from Mexico in 1998. In 2001 she began a relationship with A-R-D-', who was
abusive soon after the relationship began. From approximately September 2001 to September 2002, he
subjected her to a severe form of trafficking in persons when he forced her to work as a servant in
Oklahoma. The trafficking ended in 2002 when A-R-D- forced the Applicant to go with him to Mexico.
The Applicant reentered the United States in [redacted] 2006 and was removed to Mexico that same
month. She entered the [*4] United States again in October 2014.

In our decision on appeal, we affirmed the Directorâs finding that the Applicant had not established that
she is physically present in in the United States on account of a severe form of trafficking in persons, as
required by section 101(a)(15)(T)@dD of the Act. We found that the Applicant had demonstrated that her
current presence in the United States is directly related to her past trafficking, as described at Â§ C.F.R.
Â§ 2/4. 1 1(g)(1) (iv). However, we explained that because she had reentered the United States in 2014 after
having been removed, she must meet an additional requirement under $ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1/g)(2)/i)-(iii) to
establish either that her reentry was the result of continued victimization, she was the victim of a new
incident of a severe form of trafficking in persons, or she was allowed reentry for participation in
investigative or judicial processes relating to an act or perpetrator of the trafficking. We concluded that
the Applicant had not met her burden to establish that she meets this requirement.

On motion, the Applicant contends that we erred in finding that the Applicant did not establish that her
reentry was the result of [*5] continued victimization under 8 C_F.R. Â§ 2/4./1(g)(2)(i)-(iii). As an initial
matter, she contends that 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1(g)(2)* does not apply to her case because A-R-D- trafficked

her out of the United States in 2002. She repeats the claim she made on appeal that her subsequent
reentries in 2006 and 2014 were to escape him rather than to seek employment or for âfrivolousâ reasons.
She alleges that âto categorize those attempted entries as voluntary departures or removals is woefully
unfair and unjust.â First, our analysis under $ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.//(g)(2) considers whether her departures
from the United States, not her entries or attempted entries into the country, were voluntary departures or
removals. The Applicant does not provide any legal support for her assertion that the reason for her entries
should govern whether her subsequent departures qualified as voluntary departures or removals.
Additionally, as we explained in our decision on appeal, although the Applicantâs departure to Mexico in
2002 was not [*6] a voluntary departure or removal because it occurred under A-R-D-âs control, she was
removed pursuant to a final removal order in 2006. It is not within our authority to determine or
categorize the manner of her departure in 2006, as the record reflects that she was subject to a final
removal order from an Immigration Judge based on a finding that she was removable under section
212(a)(6)(A)(G@) of the Act. Accordingly, based on the requirements of the regulation, the Applicant is
subject to 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1(g)(2) because she was removed in 2006 and subsequently reentered in 2014.

Additionally, the Applicant again argues that A-R-D- subjected her to involuntary servitude after forcing
her to return to Mexico in 2002, when he imprisoned her in a small room and denied her access to food,
water, and a toilet. She alleges that we erred in finding on appeal that such maltreatment did not amount to
a severe form of trafficking in persons. The record shows that A-R-D- harbored the Applicant in the small
room through force, and that he subjected her to terrible conditions and extreme maltreatment there.
However, the Applicant still does not claim, and the evidence of record does not show, that [*7] A-R-D-
held the Applicant in the room for the purpose of subjecting her to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt
bondage, or slavery. Such a purpose is required to meet the definition of trafficking at S CFR.
Â§ 214.1] 1(a). The Applicant has not claimed that A-R-D- subjected her to, or attempted or planned to
subject her to, involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery while he harbored her in the
room. Furthermore, whether this incident qualifies as trafficking does not change our determination that
the Applicantâs reentry into the United States in 2014 was not the result of continued victimization from
trafficking.

The Applicant also contends that our denial of her appeal violated the policy of the T visa program, which
is to protect victims of human trafficking. However, to qualify for T nonimmigrant status, an applicant
must meet all of the statutory requirements. In addition to being a victim of a severe form of trafficking in
persons, an applicant must establish, among other requirements, that she is physically present in the
United States on account of such trafficking. Section 101(a)(15)(T)G) of the Act. The Applicant has not
met that requirement and therefore does [*8] not qualify for T nonimmigrant status.

Moreover, the Applicant asserts that because we found that her current presence is directly related to her
past trafficking as described at $ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1(g)(/)(iv), our finding that she did not meet the physical
presence requirement at section 101(a)(15)(T)@) of the Act was inconsistent. She argues that our finding
demonstrates an ambiguity between the statute and the regulation, and that pursuant to the rule of lenity
the ambiguity should be resolved in her favor. The rule of lenity generally applies only to criminal or
deportation provisions, which are not at issue in this case. See, e.g., INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 320
(2001) (noting the âlongstanding principle of construing any lingering ambiguities in deportation statutes

?The Applicant cites the former 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4. /](g)(3) in this portion of her brief. Under the amended regulations, the applicable section on
this issue is 8 CLF.R. Â§ 2/4 J] (g)(2).

in favor of the alienâ); see also [.N.S. vy. Cardoza-Fonseca, 450 U.S. 421, 449 (1987) (same); [.N.S. v.
Errico, 385 U.S. 214, 225 (1966) (explaining that courts should resolve doubts in favor of an alien
âbecause deportation is a drastic measure and at times the equivalent of banishment or exileâ); United
States vy. Gonzalez-Mendez, 150 _F.3d_1058, 106] (9th Cir. 1998) (stating that the court âconstrue[s]
ambiguities [*9] in criminal statutes in favor of defendantsâ). Additionally, the rule of lenity, âwhich
provides that ambiguities in statutes must be construed in an alienâs favor, is a doctrine of âlast resortâ to
be employed only after traditional means of statutory interpretation have failed to resolve any
ambiguities.â Matter of Rocco Oppedisano, 26 I&N Dec. 202, 206-7 (BIA 2013) citing Patel v. Ashcroft,
294 F.3d 465, 473 n.9 (stating that the ârule [of lenity] only applies if there is a âgrievous ambiguity or
uncertainty in the statuteââ) (quoting Muscarello v. United States, 542 U.S. 125, 138 (1998)) (additional
citations omitted).

We disagree that there is an ambiguity between the statute and regulation here. Where, as in this case, an
applicant has voluntarily departed or been removed from the United States at any time after having been
trafficked and then reentered the country, the applicable regulations list two separate requirements for an
applicant to establish physical presence under section 101(a)(15)(T)() of the Act. First, the applicant must
show that she falls into one of the scenarios at 8 C.F.R. Â§2/4./]/](g)(1). Second, as a result of her
voluntary departure or removal and subsequent [*10] reentry, the applicant will not be considered
physically present on account of trafficking, despite establishing one of the scenarios at Â§ C.F.R.

Â§2/4./1(g)(1), unless she meets one of the exceptions listed at 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1/(g)(2). In the present
case, although the Applicant has submitted sufficient evidence to show that she falls within the scenario at

& C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.11(g)(1)(iv), she has not established that she meets any of the exceptions at S C.F.R.
Â§ 214. 11(g)(2).

Accordingly, whether the Applicantâs current physical presence is directly related to past trafficking under
8 C.F.R. Â§ 214.11(g)()(iv) is a separate issue from whether her reentry after removal was the result of
continued victimization under $_ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.//(g)(2)(i). The phrase âdirectly relatedâ at $ C.F.R.
Â§ 214.1 1(g)(1)(iv) indicates that the Applicantâs physical presence must be connected to trafficking that
happened in the past. By contrast, the requirement at $5 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.//(g)(2)(i) that the Applicantâs
reentry be âthe result of continued victimizationâ indicates that the reentry was not simply related to, but
was the consequence of trafficking victimization. As we discussed in our decision on appeal, [*11] when
we evaluate the evidence of the physical presence requirement, relevant factors we may consider include
when an applicant escaped the trafficker, what activities he or she has since undertaken to deal with the
consequences of having been trafficked, and his or her ability to leave the United States. Â§ C.F.R.
Â§ 214.1 1(g)(4). The Interim T Rule explains that this ârequire[s] a consideration of the victimâs current
situation ....â Classification for Victims of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons; Eligibility for âTâ
Nonimmigrant Status (Interim T Rule), 81 Fed. Reg. 92266, 92273 (Dec. 19, 2016). As we explained, the
Applicant has submitted sufficient evidence to show that, although her trafficking ended in 2002, she
continues to suffer post-traumatic stress disorder, and the effects of the trauma have had a lasting impact
on her daily life. For these reasons, we found on appeal that the preponderance of the evidence is
sufficient to show that the Applicantâs current physical presence is directly related to her past trafficking,
as described at 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.11(g)(1)(iv).

However, the consideration of whether the Applicant meets the requirement at Â§ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1(g)(2) is
distinct. [*12] The issue is not whether the Applicantâs physical presence today is directly related to her
past trafficking but whether, at the time she reentered the United States in 2014, she did so as the result of

a situation of ongoing victimization from trafficking. The regulation defines âvictim of a severe form of
trafficking in persons (victim)ââ as âan alien who is or has been subject to a severe form of trafficking in
persons.â CER. Â§2/4./l(a). Although the regulation does not limit the phrase âcontinued
victimizationâ only to applicants who are currently being subjected to trafficking at the time of reentry, its
definition of âvictimâ indicates that the term refers to victimization from trafficking rather than from other
types of harm. Although the record shows that the Applicant was afraid of A- R-D- at the time she
reentered the United States, the evidence is insufficient to show that the reason for her reentry was
continued victimization from trafficking rather than other types of harm.

On motion, the Applicant also contends that we mistakenly interpreted âcontinued victimizationâ under &
CER. Â§ 214.11 (g)(2)(i) to require a physical harm component. She also claims that we minimized [*13]
A-R-D-âs actions toward her and failed to recognize that he used threats and fear to maintain his control
over her throughout the time she was in Mexico. We did not find in our prior decision that the Applicant
must show that A-R-D- was subjecting her to physical harm at the time she reentered the United States.
We stated that although the Applicant remained fearful of A-R-D-, the evidence did not show that her
reasons for reentering the United States were due to continued victimization from trafficking. Although
we mentioned that the evidence did not show that A-R-D- subjected the Applicant to physical harm
between 2002 and 2014, we did so within a broader discussion of how the Applicantâs contact with A-R-
D- during that period amounted to an ongoing abusive situation involving types of harm other than
continued victimization from trafficking. We noted that the Applicantâs period of trafficking ended in
2002, and that she remained living independently in Mexico for many years with only occasional contact
with A-R-D-. Although she claims on motion that A-R-D- maintained control over her by threatening her
and instilling fear, she indicated in her statement that she âwould go years [*14] without hearing of him,â
that she knew he was in hiding from other drug cartels, and that when he tried to enter her house, she did
not let him. The evidence does not establish that his actions at that time occurred within the context of a
trafficking situation.

The record reflects that the Petitioner became involved with A-R-D- in 2001, and that he subjected her to
trafficking when he forced her labor as a servant from 2001 until 2002. The record further shows that,
after that time, A-R-D- continued to subject the Petitioner to varying forms of abuse, including harboring
her in a locked room, making threats against her and her children, attempting to harm her children, and
causing her to fear him through unpredictable and violent behaviors, and that these abusive actions
continued until 2014, when she fled Mexico and entered the United States. Despite the severity of the
abuse, however, which is not in dispute, the record does not establish that the Applicantâs 2014 entry was
due to her continued victimization within the meaning of S C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.///(g)(2), given the passage of
approximately 12 years between the conclusion of the trafficking and her reentry, A-R-D-âs subsequent
use [*15] of additional tactics which, while serious, do not fall within the definition of severe form of
trafficking in persons, and the regulatory requirement that her reentry be the result of rather than simply
related to, her continued victimization as a trafficking victim. Accordingly, the Applicant has not
established error in our prior finding that she does not meet the exception at Â§ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./](g)(2)(i).
Therefore, she has not demonstrated that she is physically present in in the United States on account of a
severe form of trafficking in persons, as section 101(a)(15)(T)G@)UD of the Act requires."

or parole in August 2015. In her statements in the record before the Director, the Applicant explained that
she and her one-year old daughter traveled to the United States with the assistance of smugglers, who
ultimately stopped in the desert and told them that they would not accompany them any further [*3] and
that they should continue walking until they reached a city. The Applicant stated that, as she and her
daughter continued to walk, they encountered a group of four men who told them that they would have to
pay to pass by them. The Applicant explained that she gave the men all the money that she had in her
possession but, believing that she had more money, the men forced the Applicant to remove her clothing
and stripped off her daughterâs clothing. In their search for more money, the men raped the Applicant and
sexually assaulted her daughter. The Applicant stated that after raping her, the men showed them a path
they could follow to reach immigration authorities. The Applicant filed the instant T application in August
2016.

An applicant may be classified as a T-1 nonimmigrant if she: is or has been a victim of a severe form of
trafficking in persons; is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; has
complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking; and
would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States.
Section 101(a)(15)(T)@ of the Act; 8 CFR. [*4] Â§ 2/4.11(b)()-(4). âSevere form of trafficking in
personsâ is defined as, most relevantly, âsex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is inducedâ and
âthe person induced to perform such act is under the age of 18 years[.]â $ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4. ///a). In turn, âsex
traffickingâ means âthe recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or
soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act,â id., and âcommercial sex actâ is defined as
âany sex act on account of which anything or value is given to or received by any person.â 22 U.S.C.
Â§ 7102(4); & C.F.R. Â§ 214.11 (a).

In our prior decision on appeal, incorporated here by reference, we acknowledged that the Applicant was
the unfortunate victim of rape, but found that the record did not establish that she was subjected to a
severe form of trafficking in persons, as required by the Act and relevant regulations. Specifically, we
found that the evidence did not show that the Applicant was recruited, harbored, transported, provided,
obtained, patronized, or solicited for the purpose of a commercial sex act, as the record indicated that the
rape of the Applicant was not on account of or in exchange for anything [*5] of value; rather, the record
indicated that the perpetrators robbed the Applicant, sexually assaulted her daughter in their search for
more money, raped the Applicant, and then provided the Applicant with directions. Relatedly, we noted
that, although the record indicated a possible shift in the perpetratorsâ purpose from a robbery to the rape
of the Applicant, it did not indicate that the perpetrators at any time recruited, harbored, transported,
provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited the Applicant for the purpose of a commercial sex act. We
last concluded that, because the record did not establish that the Applicant was a victim of a severe form

of trafficking in persons, she necessarily could not establish that she was present in the United States on
account of such trafficking, as required by the Act and relevant regulations.

On motion to reconsider, the Applicant argues that the record establishes that a commercial sex act
occurred as contemplated by S_C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.//(a). She asserts that our prior decision âimproperly
distorted [the] Applicantâs claim by finding that nothing of value was exchanged for the sex actâ when,
âin reality, the [perpetrators] chose to pay for [*6] the commission of their forced sex act through an
intangible payment of the giving of directions.â

As a preliminary matter, we acknowledge that our prior decision on appeal somewhat conflated the
requirements of the regulation defining commercial sex act, requiring both an underlying exchange in
value and that the exchange in value have occurred âon account ofâ the sex act. See 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.11(a@)
(defining âcommercial sex actâ as âany sex act on account of which anything or value is given to or
received by any person.â). In this case, we do not dispute the Applicantâs assertion that the perpetratorsâ
giving of directions was of value to her; instead, and as discussed in detail below, we find that the record
does not establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the perpetratorsâ giving of directions was on
account of the rape of the Applicant.

In the Applicantâs initial personal statement submitted with her T application, the Applicant recounted
that when the perpetrators were unable to find any money on her, they forced her to remove her clothing
and undergarments âso that they could confirm that [she] wasnât hiding any money on [her] body,â and
subsequently raped her. The [*7] Applicantâs updated statement submitted in response to a request for
evidence (RFE) from the Director clarified that, as the perpetrators sexually assaulted her daughter, they
âwere asking [the Applicant] if [she] had hid money on [her daughter].â The Applicant additionally
explained that the perpetrators âtold [her] that if [she] did not have more money they would still show
[her] the way but they would do what they wanted to [her].â She last stated that, after the rape and sexual
assault, the perpetrators âtold [her] where to goâ and âwere satisfied with their payment and so ... decided
to let [her and her daughter] pass.â

Although the Applicantâs statements may indicate some connection between the perpetratorsâ having
raped her and their having subsequently provided her with directions, the relevant inquiry in this case
concerns whether the perpetrators provided the Applicant with directions on account of the rape of the
Applicant herself. The Applicantâs statements, however, directly tie the rape of the Applicant to the
perpetratorsâ search for money and indicate only her subjective belief as to what transpired in their minds
after her rapeâthey do not establish, by a preponderance [*8] of the evidence, that the perpetrators gave
the Applicant directions on account of, or that she received directions as a result of, the rape. See &
CER. Â§ 214.11 (a) (defining âcommercial sex actâ as âany sex act on account of which anything of value
is given to or received by any personâ). Instead, and as stated in our decision on appeal, the record
indicates that the Applicant was the unfortunate victim of a rape during, and in furtherance of, a robbery.

The Applicant additionally asserts that our decision âerred by stating that the Applicant need[ed] to show
that the [perpetratorsâ] conscious object [sic] was to engage in commercial sex actsâ and âpurposely gave
directions ... as a thing of value to be exchanged for the sex act[,]â stating that the perpetratorsâ mental
state is inconsequential because the definition of a commercial sex act pays no regard to oneâs intent or
motive for acting. The Applicant similarly asserts that our decision âincorrectly analyzed whether the
[perpetrator] âs purpose was to subject the Applicant to a commercial sex actâ when we âshould have
analyzed whether the obtaining, harboring, transporting, providing, patronizing, or soliciting of [the]

Applicant [*9] was for the purpose of a commercial sexual act.â However, this argument
mischaracterizes our findings. Our decision on appeal did not imply any required mental state of the
perpetrators, as the mental state of acting âpurposelyâ for criminal purposes is irrelevant to, and distinct
from, the eligibility criteria at issue here; instead, it requiredâconsistent with the plain language of the
relevant regulationsâthat the record establish, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the Applicant
was recruited, harbored, transported, provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited âfor the purpose of a
commercial sex act.â Â§ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1(a). Borrowing from the analysis above, however, the record did
not establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a commercial sex act occurred, nor did it indicate
that the perpetrators recruited, harbored, transported, provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited the
Applicant for the purpose of one.â"

LEXIS 8988,no,"The Applicant, a native and citizen of Guatemala, entered the United States without inspection, admission,
or parole in August 2015. In her statements in the record before the Director, the Applicant explained that
she and her one-year old daughter traveled to the United States with the assistance of smugglers, who
ultimately stopped in the desert and told them that they would not accompany them [*3] any further and
that they should continue walking until they reached a city. The Applicant stated that, as she and her
daughter continued to walk, they encountered a group of four men who told them that they would have to
pay to pass by them. The Applicant explained that she gave the men all the money that she had in her
possession but, believing that she had more money, the men forced the Applicant to remove her clothing
and stripped off her daughterâs clothing. In their search for more money, the men raped the Applicant and
sexually assaulted her daughter. The Applicant stated that after raping her, the men showed them a path
they could follow to reach immigration authorities. The Applicant filed the instant T application in August
2016.

An applicant may be classified as a T-1 nonimmigrant if she: is or has been a victim of a severe form of
trafficking in persons; is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; has
complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking; and
would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States.
Section 101(a)(15)(T)@ of the Act; [*4] 5 CFR. Â§2/4.]1(b)(1)-(4). âSevere form of trafficking in
personsâ is defined as, most relevantly, âsex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is inducedâ and
âthe person induced to perform such act is under the age of 18 years[.]â $ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4. ///a). In turn, âsex
traffickingâ means âthe recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining, patronizing, or
soliciting of a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act,â id., and âcommercial sex actâ is defined as
âany sex act on account of which anything or value is given to or received by any person.â 22 U.S.C.
Â§ 7102(4); & C.F.R. Â§ 214.11 (a).

In our prior decision on appeal, incorporated here by reference, we acknowledged that the Applicant was
the unfortunate victim of rape, but found that the record did not establish that she was subjected to a
severe form of trafficking in persons, as required by the Act and relevant regulations. Specifically, we
found that the evidence did not show that the Applicant was recruited, harbored, transported, provided,
obtained, patronized, or solicited for the purpose of a commercial sex act, as the record indicated that the
rape of the Applicant was not on account of or in exchange [*5] for anything of value; rather, the record
indicated that the perpetrators robbed the Applicant, sexually assaulted her daughter in their search for
more money, raped the Applicant, and then provided the Applicant with directions. Relatedly, we noted
that, although the record indicated a possible shift in the perpetratorsâ purpose from a robbery to the rape
of the Applicant, it did not indicate that the perpetrators at any time recruited, harbored, transported,
provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited the Applicant for the purpose of a commercial sex act. We
last concluded that, because the record did not establish that the Applicant was a victim of a severe form

of trafficking in persons, she necessarily could not establish that she was present in the United States on
account of such trafficking, as required by the Act and relevant regulations.

On motion to reconsider, the Applicant argues that the record establishes that a commercial sex act
occurred as contemplated by S_C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.//(a). She asserts that our prior decision âimproperly
distorted [the] Applicantâs claim by finding that nothing of value was exchanged for the sex actâ when,
âin reality, the [perpetrators] chose [*6] to pay for the commission of their forced sex act through an
intangible payment of the giving of directions.â

As a preliminary matter, we acknowledge that our prior decision on appeal somewhat conflated the
requirements of the regulation defining commercial sex act, requiring both an underlying exchange in
value and that the exchange in value have occurred âon account ofâ the sex act. See Â§ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.11(@)
(defining âcommercial sex actâ as âany sex act on account of which anything or value is given to or
received by any person.â). In this case, we do not dispute the Applicantâs assertion that the perpetratorsâ
giving of directions was of value to her; instead, and as discussed in detail below, we find that the record
does not establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the perpetratorsâ giving of directions was on
account of the rape of the Applicant.

In the Applicantâs initial personal statement submitted with her T application, the Applicant recounted
that when the perpetrators were unable to find any money on her, they forced her to remove her clothing
and undergarments âso that they could confirm that [she] wasnât hiding any money on [her] body,â and
subsequently raped [*7] her. The Applicantâs updated statement submitted in response to a request for
evidence (RFE) from the Director clarified that, as the perpetrators sexually assaulted her daughter, they
âwere asking [the Applicant] if [she] had hid money on [her daughter].â The Applicant additionally
explained that the perpetrators âtold [her] that if [she] did not have more money they would still show
[her] the way but they would do what they wanted to [her].â She last stated that, after the rape and sexual
assault, the perpetrators âtold [her] where to goâ and âwere satisfied with their payment and so ... decided
to let [her and her daughter] pass.â

Although the Applicantâs statements may indicate some connection between the perpetratorsâ having
raped her and their having subsequently provided her with directions, the relevant inquiry in this case
concerns whether the perpetrators provided the Applicant with directions on account of the rape of the
Applicant herself. The Applicantâs statements, however, directly tie the rape of the Applicant to the
perpetratorsâ search for money and indicate only her subjective belief as to what transpired in their minds
after her rapeâthey do not establish, by a preponderance [*8] of the evidence, that the perpetrators gave
the Applicant directions on account of, or that she received directions as a result of, the rape. See 8 C.F-.R.
Â§ 2/4. / 1(q@) (defining âcommercial sex actâ as âany sex act on account of which anything of value is given
to or received by any personâ). Instead, and as stated in our decision on appeal, the record indicates that
the Applicant was the unfortunate victim of a rape during, and in furtherance of, a robbery.

The Applicant additionally asserts that our decision âerred by stating that the Applicant need[ed] to show
that the [perpetratorsâ] conscious object [sic] was to engage in commercial sex actsâ and âpurposely gave
directions ... as a thing of value to be exchanged for the sex act[,]â stating that the perpetratorsâ mental
state is inconsequential because the definition of a commercial sex act pays no regard to oneâs intent or
motive for acting. The Applicant similarly asserts that our decision âincorrectly analyzed whether the
[perpetrator] âs purpose was to subject the Applicant to a commercial sex actâ when we âshould have
analyzed whether the obtaining, harboring, transporting, providing, patronizing, or soliciting of [the]

Applicant [*9] was for the purpose of a commercial sexual act.â However, this argument
mischaracterizes our findings. Our decision on appeal did not imply any required mental state of the
perpetrators, as the mental state of acting âpurposelyâ for criminal purposes is irrelevant to, and distinct
from, the eligibility criteria at issue here; instead, it requiredâconsistent with the plain language of the
relevant regulationsâthat the record establish, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the Applicant
was recruited, harbored, transported, provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited âfor the purpose of a
commercial sex act.â Â§ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4./1(a). Borrowing from the analysis above, however, the record did
not establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a commercial sex act occurred, nor did it indicate
that the perpetrators recruited, harbored, transported, provisioned, obtained, patronized, or solicited the
Applicant for the purpose of one.â"

2020 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 10665, *1

Section 101(a)(15)(T)G) of the Act provides that an applicant may be classified [*2] as a T-1
nonimmigrant if he or she: is or has been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons; is physically
present in the United States on account of such trafficking; has complied with any reasonable requests for
assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the trafficking; and would suffer extreme hardship
involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States. The term âsevere form of
trafficking in personsâ is defined as âsex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force,
fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act is under the age of 18 years; or the
recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services through the
use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt

bondage, or slavery.â 8 C.F.R. Â§ 2/4.11(a@) (2017).

The burden of proof is on an applicant to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. &
CER. Â§ 214.11 (d)(5); Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). An applicant may submit
any credible, relevant evidence for us to consider in our de novo review; however, we determine, [*3] in
our sole discretion, the value of that evidence. Â§ C.F.R. Â§ 2/4. /1(d)(5).

Il. ANALYSIS

In our decision on appeal, we agreed with the Director that the Applicant had not provided sufficient
evidence to meet her burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that she was the victim of
a severe form of trafficking in persons. We noted that the Applicantâs personal statements in support of
her T application were unclear and difficult to understand and did not provide probative details about her
experiences. Further, we found that although the Applicant claimed that she was the victim of involuntary
servitude, she did not specify what facts she relied on to support her claim, and the evidence of record did
not otherwise establish that she was placed in a condition of servitude.

On motion, the Applicant submits a new translation of her personal statement and asserts that the
translation she previously submitted, while accurate, was âtoo literal to be literate.â The new translation,
like the prior version, is difficult to understand and does not include sufficient clear, probative detail about
the Applicantâs experiences to support a finding that she was the victim of a severe [*4] form of
trafficking in persons under section 101(a)(15)(T)@) of the Act.

Furthermore, the Applicant does not allege that our decision was based on an incorrect application of law
or policy and was incorrect based on the evidence in the record of proceedings at the time of the decision,
as required to meet the requirements for a motion to reconsider. 5 C.F.R. Â§ /03.5(a)(3). Instead, she
concedes that the personal statement she previously submitted was unreadable. She does not contend that
we erred in concluding that she did not submit sufficient evidence to establish that she was the victim of a
severe form of trafficking. Additionally, she still does not specify which facts support her claim that she
was subjected to involuntary servitude, but instead adds a new claim on motion that she was subjected to
debt bondage. The Applicant has not met the requirements of a motion to reconsider under Â§ C.F.R."

Upon review, we will dismiss the motion to reopen and motion to .reconsider.",2020 Immig. Rptr. LEXIS 10292,no,"As discussed in our decision on appeal, the Applicant last entered the United States without admission,
inspection, or parole in February 2015 when he was 16 years old. He filed his T application in May 2016
based on a claim that a drug cartel subjected him to labor trafficking. The Director denied the T
application because the record demonstrated that the Applicant was inadmissible to the United States
under sections 212(a)(2)(C) (reason to believe the applicant has been a controlled substance trafficker),
212(a)(6)(A)G) (present without admission or inspection), 212(a)(6)(E) (alien smuggling), and
212(a)(7)(B)G)(), GD (monimmigrant without a valid passport or valid visa) of the Act, and his
application to waive the grounds of inadmissibility had been denied.

We noted in [*4] our decision on appeal that the Applicant had not contested his inadmissibility on the
grounds identified by the Director, and that our review of the record found no error in the Directorâs
determination of inadmissibility. Additionally, we noted that the Applicant may be inadmissible under
section 212(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the Act for drug abuse or addiction. We explained that the Applicant had
admitted in his personal statements that he used drugs, including cocaine and marijuana, from age nine
until age 16. Although the Applicant submitted a Form 1-693, Report of Medical Examination and
Vaccination Record (medical examination), it did not indicate that a civil surgeon had been informed of
the Applicantâs past drug use and considered whether he was in remission. Further, we noted that the
record did not establish the examining physicianâs qualification as a designated civil surgeon or panel
physician authorized to make a finding as to whether a Class A or B Substance (Drug) Abuse/Addiction
exists. Accordingly, we concluded that the record did not overcome the evidence of the Applicantâs
inadmissibility under section 212(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the Act for substance abuse or addiction.

On motion, [*5] the Applicant still does not contest his inadmissibility under sections 212(a)(2)(C),
212(a)(6)(A)G), 212(a)(6)(E), and 212(a)(7)(B)G@)d), UD of the Act, but asserts that we erred in not
considering his argument that the Director had relied on an erroneous legal standard when considering his
T waiver application. He argues that the Director improperly applied the factors in Matter of Hranka, 16
I&N Dec. 49] (BIA 1987), and that we should have considered his arguments regarding that error.
However, Matter of Hranka discusses factors relating to whether an applicant merits a waiver, including
the risk an applicant poses to society, the seriousness of immigration or criminal law violations, and the
reasons for an applicantâs desire to enter the United States. 16 I&N Dec. at 493. These factors are relevant
to the Applicantâs request for a waiver of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion, of which there is no
appeal. 5 C.F.R. Â§ 2/2./6(c). As discussed, we have authority to consider whether the Director was
correct in finding the Applicant inadmissible to the United States and, therefore, requiring an approved
waiver application, but not to review whether the Director improperly denied [*6] the waiver. The
Applicant has not contested his inadmissibility under the grounds the Director identified, and the record
does not indicate error in the Directorâs inadmissibility determination.

The Applicant further states on motion that we erred in determining that he was inadmissible under
section 212(a)(1)(A)(iv) of the Act for drug abuse or addiction. He argues that the fact that the physician
did not indicate that he was in remission, but instead indicated that there was âNo Class A or B Substance
(Drug) Abuse/Addiction,â does not establish that the physician was unaware of his past drug use. He
submits a personal statement indicating he does not recall whether the physician asked him whether he
had used drugs in the past, but that if the physician had asked such questions, he would have answered
honestly. He also states that he knew one purpose of the medical examination was to ensure he was no
longer using drugs, and he took a drug test at the appointment. Furthermore, he provides evidence to show
that the physician who completed his medical examination was an approved civil surgeon. However,
regardless of whether the Applicant is inadmissible under section 212(a)(1)(A)(iv) [*7] of the Act, he
remains inadmissible under sections 212(a)(2)(C), 212(a)(6)(A)(@), 212(a)(6)(E), and 212(a)(7)(B)G@)(D,
(II) of the Act, he does not dispute his inadmissibility on those grounds, and his T waiver application
remains denied.

Il. CONCLUSION

On motion, the Applicant does not state new facts that establish his eligibility, nor does he establish that
our decision was based on an incorrect application of law or policy and that the decision was incorrect
based on the evidence in the record at the time of the decision. The Applicant remains inadmissible and"

However, we determined that the Applicant had not established that she is physically present in the United States on account of her trafficking, as section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(II) of the Act requires, and that she therefore was not eligible for T nonimmigrant classification. 
As we discussed in our appeal decision, the Applicant’s boyfriend, C-T-,2 subjected her to severe physical, verbal, and sexual abuse beginning in 2000. In 2003, the Applicant went to Mexico to bring her daughter to the United States, returning to C-T- because he threatened to kill her if she left him. After she returned, C-T- said she had to repay him the money he spent for her to go to Mexico, and he forced her to work picking tomatoes to repay the debt. He feared C-T- would harm her in Mexico, was receiving services for trafficking victims in the United States, and was struggling financially. However, we concluded that the Applicant did not claim that she had ongoing contact with C-T- or had reason to believe she would fall under his control again, did not establish that her present financial hardship was directly related to her past trafficking, and did not indicate that she was suffering ongoing physical or emotional harm resulting from the trafficking that continued to adversely affect her life. 
forced her to work six to seven days per week [*4] from 2003 until 2010, watched her while she worked and yelled at her if she rested or drank water, and would not allow her to leave the house unless she was working or getting groceries. He threatened to beat her and take her children if she did not work, and refused to let her rest even when she was in pain or felt ill due to working in high heat. When she begged for time off: he hit her in the nose and caused it to bleed, burned her arm with a tortilla griddle, and threw plates and food at her. He also took half of her salary each week, leaving her without enough to feed her three children, and said she must provide for him or he would take the children away. Further, he threatened that she would be deported if she reported him and that if she left him, he would find and kill her and her children. The Applicant finally escaped in 2010, when she sought medical help after C-T- beat and raped her. She filed her T application in 2016. We determined that the Applicant was subjected to involuntary servitude as defined at 8 
and therefore had established that she was the victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons under section 101(a)(15)(T)(i)(I) of the Act. 
The[*5] Applicant claims that she is physically present in the United States under 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(g)(1)(iv) as an individual who was trafficked in the past and whose continued presence in the United States is directly related to the past trafficking. On appeal, we determined that the Applicant had not submitted sufficient evidence to meet this requirement. We noted that the Applicant claimed that she 
On motion to reconsider, the Applicant asserts that we misapplied the regulation and violated applicable law and policy. She contends that we did not apply the “any credible evidence” standard at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11(d)(5), but instead required evidence [*6] additional to her testimony, and gave insufficient weight to her statements regarding the “financial, emotional, and physical harm that she continues to suffer as a result of trafficking.” She also alleges that we did not consider the length of time she was subjected to abuse and trafficking and incorrectly assessed her current situation by determining that her statements indicated that her life had improved. She further argues that she remains financially vulnerable and depends on services for trafficking survivors that she receives in the United States. Additionally, she states that she can seek police protection from her trafficker in the United States but would be at risk of harm if he found her in Mexico."
