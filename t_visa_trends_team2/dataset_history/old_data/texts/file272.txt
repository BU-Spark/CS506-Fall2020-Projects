U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8914075 Appeal of Milwaukee, Wisconsin Field Office Decision Form N-600, Application for a Certificate of Citizenship Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 16, 2020 The Applicant seeks a Certificate of Citizenship to reflect that she derived U.S. citizenship upon naturalization of her parents under former section 321 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1432, repealed by Sec. 103(a), title I, Child Citizenship Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-395, 114 Stat. 1631 (2000). To derive U.S. citizenship under that section, a person born abroad to alien parents must fulfill certain conditions before turning 18 years of age. The Director of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin Field Office denied the application, concluding that the Applicant did not derive U.S. citizenship because she was not admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident until after her 18th birthday. On appeal, the Applicant asserts that she satisfied all of the requirements for derivative citizenship, including lawful residence in the United States before she was 18 years old and the Director's decision was therefore in error. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW The Applicant was born in Nigeria inD 1978 to alien parents who married shortly after her birth. The record indicates that the Applicant was admitted to the United States in 1984 as a nonimmigrant child of an academic student (F-2). Both her parents became U.S. citizens through naturalization in November 1994, when she was 16 years old. The Applicant subsequently adjusted status to that of a lawful permanent resident child of a U.S. citizen in September 1997, when she was 19 years of age. To determine whether the Applicant derived U.S. citizenship from her parents based on these facts, we apply "the law in effect at the time the critical events giving rise to eligibility occurred."
