U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 10343928 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 21, 2020 The Petitioner, an information technology consulting company, seeks to employ the Beneficiary temporarily as an "SAP FICO -business systems analyst" under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations.1 The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Vermont Service Center Director denied the Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, concluding that: (1) the position's prerequisites were too diverse resulting in the Petitioner not satisfying the definition of a specialty occupation; (2) the record did not establish that the proffered position qualified as a specialty occupation under the four criteria at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A); and (3) the Petitioner would have an employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary. The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 2 We review the questions in this matter de novo. 3 Upon de novo review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. PROCEDURAL SHORTCOMING The Director denied the petition based on three independent grounds: 1. The failure of the position requirements to satisfy the definition of a specialty occupation; 2. The Petitioner did not demonstrate eligibility under the regulatory criteria at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)( 4 )(iii)(A); and 3. The Petitioner would not enjoy the requisite employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary. 1 See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 10 l(a)(l 5)(H)(i)(b ), 8 U.S.C. ยง l 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b ). 2 Section 291 of the Act; Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). 3 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
