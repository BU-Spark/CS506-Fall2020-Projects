U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 7953789 Appeal of National Benefits Center Decision Form 1-485, Application to Adjust Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 21, 2020 The Applicant is a citizen of Nepal who seeks to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident under section 13 of the 1957 Immigration Act (Section 13). 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255b. Section 13 allows a foreign national who was previously an A-1, A-2, G-1, or G-2 nonimmigrant to adjust status if certain criteria are met.1 The Director of the National Benefits Center denied the application, concluding that the Applicant did not establish, as required, that he performed diplomatic or semi-diplomatic duties in the course of his employment in the United States with the government of Rwanda and that there were compelling reasons precluding his return to Nepal. On appeal, the Applicant submits additional evidence and asserts that he and his family will be persecuted in Nepal by the current ruling party. In these proceedings, it is the Applicant's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1361. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal because the Applicant has not met this burden. I. LAW Section 13 is an adjustment of status category for foreign nationals who can demonstrate, in part: (1) failure to maintain A-1, A-2, G-1, or G-2 nonimmigrant status as of the application's filing date; (2) performance of diplomatic or semi-diplomatic duties by the principal on behalf of the accrediting country; and (3) inability, because of compelling reasons, to return to the country that accredited the foreign national. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255b(b); 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.3.2 1 Pub. L. No. 85-316, 71 Stat. 642, amended by Pub. L. No. 97-116, 95 Stat. 161 (1981). The A non immigrant classification is for diplomats and foreign government officials (principal) as well as their immediate family members. The G non immigrant classification is for employees of certain international organizations (principal) and their immediate family members. See https://travel.state.gov. 2 If the first three eligibility requirements are met, applicants must also establish that compelling reasons demonstrate that their adjustment would be in the national interest and would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or security of the United States and that they are of good moral character and admissible to the United States. Discussion of these remaining criteria is generally unnecessary in cases where the first three eligibility criteria have not been met.
