U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 3520564 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 2, 2020 The Applicant seeks T-1 nonimmigrant classification as a victim of human trafficking under sections 10l(a)(15)(T) and 214(0) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. sections 1101(a)(15)(T) and 1184(0). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status (T application), concluding that the record did not establish that the Applicant is physically present in the United States on account of having been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons. In addition, the Director concluded that the Applicant was inadmissible to the United States and the applicable grounds of inadmissibility had not been waived. On appeal, the Applicant submits a brief, additional evidence, and copies of previously submitted evidence, and asserts her eligibility. We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW Section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act provides that applicants may be classified as T-1 nonimmigrants if they: are or have been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons; are physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; have complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking; and would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.1 l(b)(l)-(4) (2018).1 The term "severe form of trafficking in persons" is defined, in pertinent part, as "the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery." 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(a). 1 The Department of Homeland Security issued an interim rule, effective January 18, 2017, amending its regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 214.11 for victims of human trafficking who seek T nonimrnigrant status. See Classification for Victims of Severe Forms of Trafficking in Persons; Eligibility for "T" Nonimmigrant Status (Interim T Rule), 81 Fed. Reg. 92266, 92308-09 (Dec. 19, 2016).
