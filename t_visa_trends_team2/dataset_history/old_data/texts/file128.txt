U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8821741 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 30, 2020 The Petitioner seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as an "IT business analyst" under the H-IB nonirnmigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-IB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty ( or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The California Service Center Director denied the petition, concluding that the record did not establish that the proffered position is a specialty occupation. The petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence.1 The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) reviews the questions in this matter de nova. 2 Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LEGAL FRAMEWORK Section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Act defines an H-lB nonirnrnigrant as a foreign national "who is corning temporarily to the United States to perform services ... in a specialty occupation described in section 214(i)(l) ... "(emphasis added). Section 214(i)(l) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง l 184(i)(l), defines the term "specialty occupation" as an occupation that requires "theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States." The regulation at 8 C.F .R. ยง 214.2(h)( 4 )(ii) largely restates section 2 l 4(i)(l) of the Act but adds a non-exhaustive list of fields of endeavor. In addition, 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) provides that the 1 Section 291 of the Act; Matter ofChawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). 2 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
