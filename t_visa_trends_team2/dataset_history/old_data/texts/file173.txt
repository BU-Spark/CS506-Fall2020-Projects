U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9895142 Appeal of Texas Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 24, 2020 Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) The Petitioner, an actor, seeks classification as an alien of extraordinary ability. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b)(l)(A), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1153(b)(l)(A). This first preference classification makes immigrant visas available to those who can demonstrate their extraordinary ability through sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in their field through extensive documentation. The Director of the Texas Service Center denied the petition, concluding that although the Petitioner satisfied three of the initial evidentiary criteria, as required, he did not show sustained national or international acclaim and demonstrate that he is among the small percentage at the very top of the field of endeavor. In addition, the Director determined that the Petitioner did not establish that he would substantially benefit prospectively the United States. In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. See Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1361. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW Section 203(b )(1 )(A) of the Act makes visas available to immigrants with extraordinary ability if: (i) the alien has extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics which has been demonstrated by sustained national or international acclaim and whose achievements have been recognized in the field through extensive documentation, (ii) the alien seeks to enter the United States to continue work in the area of extraordinary ability, and (iii) the alien's entry into the United States will substantially benefit prospectively the United States.
