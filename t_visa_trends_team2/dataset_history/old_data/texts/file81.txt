U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8847294 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office DATE: JUNE 8, 2020 The Petitioner, a software, services and internet technologies business, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a product marketing manager under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty ( or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the California Service Center denied the petition, concluding the evidence was insufficient to establish that the position qualified as a specialty occupation under any of the criteria in 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). The matter is now before us on appeal. On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that the Director did not consider all the evidence submitted and held the Petitioner to a higher standard than preponderance of the evidence. We will dismiss the appeal. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services records indicate that the Petitioner filed a subsequent Form 1-129, Petition forNonimmigrant Worker, seeking nonimmigrant H-1B classification on behalf of the Beneficiary and that the petition was approved. Because the Beneficiary of the instant petition has been approved for H-lB employment with Petitioner, further pursuit of the matter at hand would be moot. ORDER: The appeal is dismissed.
