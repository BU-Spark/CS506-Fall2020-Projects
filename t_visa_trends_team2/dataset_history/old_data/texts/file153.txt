U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6361136 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 24, 2020 Form 1-914-Supplement A, Application for Qualifying Family Member of a T-1 Nonimmigrant The Applicant, who seeks "T-1" nonimmigrant classification for himself, also seeks T nonimmigrant classification of the Derivative as an immediate family member of a person granted T-1 status under Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 10l(a)(l5)(T)(ii), 8 U.S.C. ยง l 10l(a)(15)(T)(ii). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914 -Supplement A, Application for Qualifying Family Member of a T-1 Nonimmigrant (T derivative application), concluding that because the Applicant's Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status (T application) had been denied, the Derivative was ineligible as the immediate family member of a T-1 nonimmigrant. Upon de nova review, we will remand the matter to the Director. Approval of the T derivative application is contingent upon the approval of the principal T application. See 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.11(0)(9), (s)(5). The Director denied the Applicant's T application. In separate proceedings, we sustained the appeal of that denial. Because the Director denied the T derivative application solely on the ground that the principal T application was denied, we will remand the matter for the Director to consider whether the Derivative meets the remaining eligibility requirements for nonimmigrant classification as the immediate relative of a T nonimmigrant pursuant to section 101(a)(15)(T)(ii) of the Act. ORDER: The decision of the Director is withdrawn. The matter is remanded for the entry of a new decision consistent with the foregoing analysis.
