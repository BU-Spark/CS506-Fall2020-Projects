U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8772835 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 24, 2020 The Petitioner, a staffing firm, seeks to employ the Beneficiary temporarily under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations.1 The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The California Service Center Director denied the Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, concluding in part that the Petitioner did not establish an employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary. The Director also concluded that based on a lack of corroborating material, to include contracts, that the Beneficiary would perform services in a specialty occupation for the requested period of intended employment. While this appeal was pending, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision in Jtserve Alliance, Inc. v. Cissna, ---F.Supp.3d ---, 2020 WL 1150186 (D.D.C. 2020). Subsequently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rescinded previously issued policy guidance relating to H-lB petitions filed for workers who will be employed at one or more third-party worksites, and directed its officers to apply the existing regulatory definition at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(ii) to assess whether a petitioner and a beneficiary have an employer-employee relationship. 2 The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 3 We review the questions in this matter de novo.4 While we conduct de nova review on appeal, we conclude that a remand is warranted in this case in part based on the new USCIS policy guidance. The Director should issue a new decision without relying on the guidance contained within the rescinded memoranda. 1 See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง l 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b). 2 USCIS Policy Memorandum PM-602-0114, Rescission of Policy Memoranda 2 (June 17, 2020), http://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/policy-memoranda. 3 Section 291 of the Act; Matter ofChawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). 4 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
