On appeal, the Applicant submits a brief and additional evidence. Applicants bear the burden of establishing eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence.

LAW U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may in its discretion adjust the status of individuals lawfully admitted to the United States as a U nonimmigrant to that of a lawful permanent resident (LPR), if they establish, among other requirements, that they have been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of at least three years since the date of admission as a U nonimmigrant. Section 245(m)(l) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(b)(3). To meet the continuous physical presence requirement, applicants must submit certain specified evidence, including a photocopy of all pages of all of their passports valid since their admission in U nonimmigrant status ( or an equivalent travel document) or an explanation of why they do not have a passport, as well as their own affidavits and other evidence addressing their continuous physical presence for at least three years. 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(5), (9). II. ANALYSIS The Applicant, a native and citizen of Mexico, was granted derivative U nonimmigrant classification in October 2014. In September 2018, she timely filed the instant U adjustment application, which the Director denied, finding that she had not complied with the requirements of 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(5) because she proffered a copy of her passport in which some of the pages were illegible or incomplete.
