U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8659923 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JULY 17, 2020 The Petitioner, an international law firm, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a "foreign exchange professional" under the H-lB nonimrnigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b ), 8 U.S.C. ยง 110l(a)(15)(H)(i)(b ). The Director of the California Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the record does not establish that the Beneficiary possesses the appropriate license to practice in the selected occupational category or that the Beneficiary is exempt from such licensure requirements. On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that the Director erred in the decision. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 291 of the Act; Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we conclude that a remand is warranted in this case because the Director's decision is insufficient for review. I.
