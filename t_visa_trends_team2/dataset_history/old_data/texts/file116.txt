U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6500174 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 11, 2020 Form 1-914, Application for Family Member of T-1 Recipient The Applicant seeks nonimmigrant classification of the Derivative as an eligible family member of a T-1 nonimmigrant under Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) § 101(a)(15)(T)(ii), 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(T)(ii). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914 Supplement A, Application for Family Member of T-1 Recipient (derivative T application) and the matter is now before us on appeal. The appeal wi 11 be rejected. The Director denied the derivative T application filed on the Derivative's behalf because the Applicant's Form 1-914, Application for T Non immigrant Status, was denied. As a result of that denial, the Applicant was unable to establish that the Derivative was an eligible family member of a T-1 nonimmigrant, as per 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(a). Although we have appellate jurisdiction over Form 1-914 Supplement A, the derivative of a visa application is not an affected party and may not file an appeal of his or her denied derivative T application. See 8 C.F.R. § 103.3(a)(l)(iii)(B). Only the applicant of a Form 1-914 Supplement A may ti le an appeal of the denial of the derivative T application. See id. If the derivative tiles the Form 1-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, the appeal must be rejected as improperly filed pursuant to 8 C.F.R. § 103.3(a)(2)(v)(A)(l). Here, the Form 1-290B appealing the Director's decision was signed by the Derivative. As noted, the Derivative is not an affected party to the application by regulation. Accordingly, the appeal was improperly filed and must be rejected. ORDER: The appeal is rejected.
