U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6290309 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 17, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition) and concurrently denied the Petitioner's Form 1-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as Nonimmigrant (waiver application). The Director subsequently dismissed the Petitioner's motions to reconsider as untimely. We dismissed the Petitioner's appeal, and the matter is now before us on a motion to reconsider. Upon review, we will dismiss the motion to reconsider. I. LAW A motion to reconsider must establish that our decision was based on an incorrect application of law or policy and that the decision was incorrect based on the evidence in the record of proceedings at the time of the decision. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(3). When adjudicating a U petition, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) determines whether a petitioner is inadmissible, and has the authority to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion. Section 212(d)(14) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(14). U petitioners bear the burden of establishing that they are admissible to the United States or that any applicable ground of inadmissibility has been waived. 8 C.F.R. § 214.l(a)(3)(i). To meet this burden, an inadmissible U petitioner must file a waiver application in conjunction with the U petition, requesting waiver of any grounds of inadmissibility. 8 C.F.R. §§ 212.17, 214.14(c)(2)(iv). The denial of a waiver application is not appealable. 8 C.F.R. § 212.17(b)(3). Petitioners must establish that they meet each eligibility requirement of the benefit sought by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375-76 (AAO 2010). The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) reviews the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christa's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
