U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9438173 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-914, Application for T Nonirnmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JULY 22, 2020 The Applicant seeks T-1 nonirnmigrant classification as a v1ct1m of human trafficking under Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) sections 101(a)(15)(T) and 214(0), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(l5)(T) and 1184(0). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914, Application for T Nonirnmigrant Status (T application), because the record established the Applicant's inadmissibility and his Form 1-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as a Nonirnmigrant (T waiver application), requesting a waiver of the grounds of inadmissibility, had been denied. We dismissed the Applicant's subsequent appeal and the matter is now before us on a combined motion to reopen and motion to reconsider. In these proceedings, it is the Applicant's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit by a preponderance of the evidence. Upon review, we will dismiss the motion to reopen and motion to reconsider. I. LAW A motion to reopen must state new facts and be supported by documentary evidence. 8 C.F.R § 103.5(a)(2). A motion to reconsider must establish that our decision was based on an incorrect application of law or policy and that the decision was incorrect based on the evidence in the record of proceedings at the time of the decision. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(3). Section 212(d)(13) of the Act requires U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to determine whether any grounds of inadmissibility exist when adjudicating a T application, and provides USC IS with the authority to waive certain grounds of inadmissibility as a matter of discretion. The Applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she is admissible to the United States or that any grounds of inadmissibility have been waived. 8 C.F.R. § 214. l(a)(3)(i). Applicants who are inadmissible to the United States must file a T waiver application in conjunction with a T application in order to waive any ground of inadmissibility. 8 C.F .R. § § 212.16, 214.11 ( d)(2)(iii). There is no appeal of a decision to deny a waiver. 8 C.F.R. § 212.16( c ). Although the regulations do not provide for appellate review of the Director's discretionary denial of a waiver application filed in T proceedings, we may still consider whether the Director was correct in finding the Applicant inadmissible to the United States and, therefore, requiring an approved waiver application.
