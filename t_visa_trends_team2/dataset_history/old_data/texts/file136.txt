U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 10449000 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WLY 23, 2020 The Petitioner seeks to employ the Beneficiary temporarily under the H-IB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations.1 The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the evidence ofrecord does not establish that: (1) the Petitioner will have an employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary; and (2) the proffered position qualifies as a specialty occupation. While this appeal was pending, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision in Itserve Alliance, Inc. v. Cissna, ---F.Supp.3d ---, 2020 WL 1150186 (D.D.C. 2020). Subsequently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rescinded previously issued policy guidance relating to H-IB petitions filed for workers who will be employed at one or more third-party worksites. 2 The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 3 We review the questions in this matter de novo.4 While we conduct de nova review on appeal, we conclude that a remand is warranted in this case in part based on the new USCIS policy guidance. Within her new decision, the Director may wish to decide whether the Petitioner has demonstrated the substantive nature of the work the Beneficiary would perform during the intended period of employment. In particular, the Petitioner stated that the Beneficiary would work as a "Java developer" at an end-client location in Virginia. With the initial petition and in response to the Director's request for evidence, the Petitioner provided work orders and letters from the end-client and vendor that state that the Beneficiary's services will be needed until September 2019, approximately one month prior 1 See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง l 10l(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b). 2 USCIS Policy Memorandum PM-602-0114, Rescission of Policy Memoranda at 2 (June I 7, 2020), http://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/policy-memoranda. 3 Section 291 of the Act; Matter ofChawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). 4 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
