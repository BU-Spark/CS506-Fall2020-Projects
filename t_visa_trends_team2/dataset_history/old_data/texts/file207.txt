U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9434207 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JULY 24, 2020 The Petitioner, a marketing and advertising organization, seeks to employ the Beneficiary temporarily as a "analyst, digital analytics" under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. 1 The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty ( or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Vermont Service Center Director denied the Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonirnmigrant Worker, concluding that the record did not establish that the proffered position qualified as a specialty occupation. The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 2 We review the questions in this matter de novo.3 Upon de nova review, we conclude that the preponderance of the evidence satisfies the "specialty occupation" definition at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(ii) and also the criterion at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(4) for a particular position whose specific duties are so specialized and complex that their performance requires knowledge usually associated with attainment of a baccalaureate or higher degree in a specific specialty. The Petitioner sufficiently developed the position's duties that it demonstrated a nexus between an established course of study leading to a specialty degree, and how such a curriculum is necessary to perform the proffered position's specialized and highly complex duties. Therefore, the record satisfies the fourth criterion of the regulation at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A), and we withdraw the Director's decision. However, the record appears to support a determination that the prevailing wage rate designated on the Department of Labor (DOL) ETA Form 9035 & 9035E, Labor Condition Application for Nonimmigrant Workers (LCA) was not correctly calculated based on the Petitioner's position 1 See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101 (a)(l 5)(H)(i)(b ), 8 U.S.C. ยง 11 0l(a)(l 5)(H)(i)(b ). 2 Section 291 of the Act; Matter ofChawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). 3 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537,537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
