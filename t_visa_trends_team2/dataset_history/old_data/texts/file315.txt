U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services InRe: 10319151 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 11, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification under Immigration and Nationality Act ( the Act) sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), and we dismissed the Petitioner's subsequent appeal. The matter is now before us on a motion to reconsider. Upon review, we will dismiss the motion. I.

We additionally determined that the Petitioner had not established that the November 2018 Supplement B submitted on appeal was signed within six months of the date of filing of the U petition, or that the person who signed it was a certifying official. On motion, the Petitioner asserts that the regulatory provision at 8 C.F.R. § 214.14( c )(2)(i) requiring that a properly executed Supplement B be signed within the six-month period prior to filing is a non-jurisdictional claim processing rule that is subject to equitable tolling. However, the case law cited to by the Petitioner, which involves equitable tolling of a filing deadline, is inapplicable to the present matter, as the requirement that a Supplement B be properly signed within the six-month period prior to filing the U petition is an evidentiary requirement.
