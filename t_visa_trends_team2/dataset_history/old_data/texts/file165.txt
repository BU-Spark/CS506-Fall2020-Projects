U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8826329 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 30, 2020 The Petitioner seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as an "analyst" under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The California Service Center Director denied the petition, concluding that the Petitioner had not established that there is a reasonable and credible offer of employment and that no contractual documents were submitted to corroborate that the Petitioner had specialty occupation work available, and thus the position had not been established as a specialty occupation. In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit by a preponderance of the evidence.1 The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) reviews the questions in this matter de nova. 2 The matter will be remanded to the Director for further review of the record and a new decision. I. LEGAL FRAMEWORK Section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Act defines an H-lB nonimmigrant as a foreign national "who is coming temporarily to the United States to perform services ... in a specialty occupation described in section 214(i)(l) ... "(emphasis added). Section 214(i)(l) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1184(i)(l), defines the term "specialty occupation" as an occupation that requires "theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States." The regulation at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(ii) largely restates section 214(i)(l) of the Act but adds a non-exhaustive list of fields of endeavor. In addition, 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A) provides that the 1 Section 291 of the Act; Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). 2 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
