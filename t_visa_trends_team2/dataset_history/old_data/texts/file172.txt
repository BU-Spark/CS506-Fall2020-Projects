U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 10188600 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 28, 2020 The Petitioner, a full-service audio-video store and service provider, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a systems engineer, under the H-1 B nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the California Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the Petitioner did not establish that the proffered position qualifies as a specialty occupation. The Petitioner submits an appeal brief and asserts that the Director erred in the decision. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 291 of the Act; Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. ANALYSIS Upon review of the entire record, for the reasons set out below, we have determined that the Petitioner has not demonstrated that the proffered position qualifies as a specialty occupation. 1 The Director concluded that the Petitioner did not establish that the proffered position qualifies as a specialty occupation. In her decision, the Director thoroughly discussed the Petitioner's failure to meet any of the four regulatory criteria at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A)(l)-(4). Upon consideration of the entire record, including the evidence submitted and arguments made on appeal, we adopt and affirm the Director's decision with the comments below. See Matter of P.
