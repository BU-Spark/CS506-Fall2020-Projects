U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In re: 5335698 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 2, 2020 Form 1-485, Application for Adjustment of Status of Alien in U Nonimmigrant Status The Applicant seeks to become a lawful permanent resident (LPR) under section 245(m), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(m), of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), based on her "U" nonimmigrant status as a victim of domestic violence. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status (U adjustment application). We dismissed the Applicant's appeal and two subsequent motions to reopen and to reconsider. The matter is before us again on a third motion to reopen, and in the alternative, motion to reconsider. Upon review, we will dismiss the motions. I. LAW U nonimmigrants may adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident at the discretion of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Section 245(m) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(±). U adjustment applicants bear the burden of proof and persuasion to establish that they are eligible for and merit adjustment of status. 8 C.F .R. § 245.24(b ), ( d)(l 0). They must demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). An individual subject to an order of voluntary departure is ineligible for adjustment of status for 10 years if he or she "voluntarily fails to depart the United States within the time period specified" in the order. Section 240B(d)(l)(B) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1229c(d). An individual has not "voluntarily" failed to depart the United States under section 240B(d)(l) of the Act when, through no fault of his or her own, he or she was unaware of the voluntary departure order or was physically unable to depart within the time granted. Matter ofZmijewska, 24 I&N Dec. 87, 94 (BIA 2007). A motion to reopen must state the new facts to be proved and be supported by affidavits or other documentary evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(2). A motion to reconsider must establish that our decision was based on an incorrect application of law or policy considering the evidence in the record of proceedings at the time of the decision. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(3). An applicant bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. The Applicant's submission on motion asserts legal error in our prior decision concerning her second motion but does not include new evidence or state new facts. The Applicant does not ultimately establish her eligibility.
