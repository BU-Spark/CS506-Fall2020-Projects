U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 1114497 Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 10, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition). The Director concluded that the U petition was not approvable because the record did not establish the Petitioner was the victim of qualifying criminal activity. On appeal, the Petitioner asserts her eligibility for U nonimmigrant status. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW To qualify for U-1 nonimmigrant classification, a petitioner must establish that they: have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been the victim of qualifying criminal activity; possess information concerning the qualifying criminal activity; and have been helpful, are being helpful, or are likely to be helpful to law enforcement authorities investigating or prosecuting the qualifying criminal activity. Section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Act. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over U petitions and the petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4); Matter of Chawathe, 25 &N Dec. 369, 375 AAO 2010). As a part of meeting this burden, a petitioner must submit a Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Supplement B), from a law enforcement official certifying a petitioner's helpfulness in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity. Section 214(p)(1) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). The petitioner must also provide a statement describing the facts of their victimization as well as any additional evidence they want USCIS to consider to establish that they are a victim of qualifying criminal activity and have otherwise satisfied the remaining eligibility criteria. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(ii)-(iii). Although a petitioner may submit any relevant, credible evidence for us to consider, USCIS determines, in its sole discretion, the credibility of and weight given to all the evidence, including the Supplement B. Section 214(p)(4) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4).
