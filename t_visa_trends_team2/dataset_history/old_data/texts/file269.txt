U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 10106711 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WLY 23, 2020 The Petitioner, a specialty staffing firm, seeks to employ the Beneficiary temporarily under the H-lB nonirnmigrant classification for specialty occupations.1 The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty ( or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker, concluding that the Petitioner did not establish an employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary. While this appeal was pending, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision in Itserve Alliance, Inc. v. Cissna, ---F.Supp.3d ---, 2020 WL 1150186 (D.D.C. 2020). Subsequently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rescinded previously issued policy guidance and directed its officers to apply the existing regulatory definition at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(ii) to assess whether a petitioner and a beneficiary have an employer-employee relationship. 2 The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 3 We review the questions in this matter de novo.4 While we conduct de nova review on appeal, we conclude that a remand is warranted in this case in part based on the new USCIS policy guidance. Within her new decision, the Director may wish to further address whether the duties the Petitioner provided are more likely than not the functions the Beneficiary would perform for the end-client. Further, the Director may elect to determine what effect the end-client's claimed position requirements have on the proffered position. For instance, it initially indicated that it required a degree and three years of experience stressing that the combination of the education and the experience were an important prerequisite for the position and for the successful performance of the job duties.
