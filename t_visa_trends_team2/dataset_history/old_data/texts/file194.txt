U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9166899 Motion on Administrative Appeals Office Decision Form 1-918, Petition for UN onimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 24, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition). We dismissed the Petitioner's appeal and subsequent motion to reopen and reconsider, as well as a second motion to reconsider. This matter is now before us on a third motion to reopen and reconsider. The Applicant submits additional evidence and a brief asserting that she has demonstrated her eligibility for U-1 nonimmigrant classification. Upon review, we will grant the motion to reopen and remand this matter to the Director for further proceedings. 1 I. LAW A motion to reopen must state new facts to be proved and be supported by affidavits or other evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 103.5(a)(2). To qualify for U-1 nonimmigrant classification, a petitioner must establish that they: have suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of having been the victim of qualifying criminal activity; possess information concerning the qualifying criminal activity; and have been helpful, are being helpful, or are likely to be helpful to law enforcement authorities investigating or prosecuting the qualifying criminal activity. Section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Act. A "victim of qualifying criminal activity" is defined as an individual who has "suffered direct and proximate harm as a result of the commission of qualifying criminal activity." 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(14). "Qualifying criminal activity" is "that involving one or more of' the 26 types of crimes listed at section 10l(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Act or "any similar activity in violation ofFederal, State, or local criminal law." Section 101(a)(15)(U)(iii) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(9). 1 As the Petitioner's motion to reopen has been granted, her accompanying motion to reconsider is considered moot. As such, we need not consider the Petitioner's assertions in support of her motion to reconsider.
