U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8706264 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker (H-lB) Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 21, 2020 The Petitioner, an information technology staffing and consulting company, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary under the H-lB nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 101(a)(l5)(H)(i)(b), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). The H-lB program allows a U.S. employer to temporarily employ a qualified foreign worker in a position that requires both: (a) the theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge; and (b) the attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty ( or its equivalent) as a minimum prerequisite for entry into the position. The Director of the California Service Center denied the petition, concluding in part that the Petitioner did not establish an employer-employee relationship with the Beneficiary. The Director also concluded that based on a lack of corroborating material, to include contracts, the Petitioner had not demonstrated it would have qualifying work available for the Beneficiary. While this appeal was pending, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a decision in Jtserve Alliance, Inc. v. Cissna, ---F.Supp.3d ---, 2020 WL 1150186 (D.D.C. 2020). Subsequently, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) rescinded previously issued policy guidance relating to H-lB petitions filed for workers who will be employed at one or more third-party worksites, and directed its officers to apply the existing regulatory definition at 8 C.F.R. ยง 214.2(h)(4)(ii) to assess whether a petitioner and a beneficiary have an employer-employee relationship. 1 The matter is now before us on appeal. The Petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 2 We review the questions in this matter de novo.3 While we conduct de nova review on appeal, we conclude that a remand is warranted in this case in part based on the new USCIS policy guidance. Because this case is affected by the new policy guidance, we find it appropriate to remand the matter for the Director to consider the question anew and to adjudicate in the first instance any additional issues as may be necessary and appropriate. Accordingly, the following order shall be issued. 1 USCIS Policy Memorandum PM-602-0114, Rescission of Policy Memoranda at 2 (June I 7, 2020), http://www.uscis.gov/legal-resources/policy-memoranda. 2 Section 291 of the Act; Matter ofChawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). 3 See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
