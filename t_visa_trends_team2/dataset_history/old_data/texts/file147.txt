U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9114784 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: WL Y 2, 2020 The Petitioner, a staffing, servicing, and consulting firm, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a "UNIX specialist" under the H-1 B nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations.
