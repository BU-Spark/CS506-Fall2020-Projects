U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6559292 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 29, 2020 The Applicant seeks T-1 nonimmigrant classification as a v1ct1m of human trafficking under Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) sections 101(a)(15)(T) and 214(0), 8 U.S.C. §§ 110l(a)(l5)(T) and 1184(0). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status (T application), concluding that the Applicant had not established that she was the victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons and is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking. The Director also noted that the Applicant is inadmissible. On appeal, the Applicant reasserts her eligibility. Upon de nova review, we will remand the matter to the Director. I. LAW Section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act provides that an applicant may be classified as a T-1 nonimmigrant if he or she: is or has been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons; is physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; has complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of the trafficking; and would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States. The term "severe form of trafficking in persons" is defined in pertinent part as "the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery."1 8 C.F.R. § 214.1 l(a) (2017). The burden of proof is on an applicant to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.1 l(d)(5); Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). An applicant may submit any credible, relevant evidence for us to consider in our de nova review; however, we determine, in our sole discretion, the value of that evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.1 l(d)(5). 1 The definition also includes sex trafficking, which is not at issue in this case.
