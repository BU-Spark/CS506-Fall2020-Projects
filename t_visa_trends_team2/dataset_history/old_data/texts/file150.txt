U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6035057 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-914, Applicant for T Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: AUG. 31, 2020 The Applicant seeks T-1 nonimmigrant classification as a victim of human trafficking under sections 101(a)(15)(T) and 214(0) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(T) and 1184(0). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status (T application), concluding that the record did not establish that the Applicant's physical presence in the United States is on account of trafficking. On appeal, the Applicant submits a brief asserting his eligibility. We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christa's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW Section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act provides that applicants may be classified as a T-1 nonimmigrant if they: are or have been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons; are physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; have complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking; and would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.ll(b)(l)-(4) (2018). The burden of proof is on an applicant to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(d)(5); Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). An applicant may submit any credible evidence for us to consider in our de nova review; however, we determine, in our sole discretion, the weight to give that evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(d)(5). II. ANALYSIS The Applicant, a native and citizen of the Philippines, claims to have entered the United States in 2013, and filed for T classification in October 2017. She bases her T application eligibility on the claim that she was a victim of labor trafficking. The Director determined that the Applicant demonstrated her victimization of a severe form of trafficking in person, but that she has not established her physical presence in the United States is on account of such trafficking.
