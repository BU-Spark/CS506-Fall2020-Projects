U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 5437706 Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for UN onimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: OCT. 1, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(l5)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ l 10l(a)(l5)(U) and l 184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), concluding that the Petitioner did not establish his admissibility, as required. The Director concurrently denied the Petitioner's Form 1-192, Application for Advance Permission to Enter as Nonimmigrant (waiver application), finding that a favorable exercise of discretion was not warranted. On appeal, the Petitioner asserts that the Director's decision was in error. Petitioners must establish that they meet each eligibility requirement of the benefit sought by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter of Chawathe, 25 I&N Dec. 369, 375-76 (AAO 2010). The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) reviews the questions in this matter de novo. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).

Section 212(d)(14) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(14). U petitioners bear the burden of establishing that they are admissible to the United States or that any applicable ground of inadmissibility has been waived. 8 C.F.R. § 214.l(a)(3)(i). To meet this burden, an inadmissible U petitioner must file a waiver application in conjunction with the U petition, requesting waiver of any grounds of inadmissibility. 8 C.F.R. §§ 212.17, 214.14(c)(2)(iv). The denial of a waiver application is not appealable. 8 C.F.R. § 212.17(b )(3). Although we do not have jurisdiction to review the Director's discretionary denial, we may consider whether the Director's underlying determination of inadmissibility was correct. II. ANALYSIS The Petitioner filed his U petition in November 2014. The Director denied the petition because the Petitioner was inadmissible to the United States and the Director had denied the Petitioner's waiver application in a separate decision. In the denial of the waiver application, the Director concluded that
