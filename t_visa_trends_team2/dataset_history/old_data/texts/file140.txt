U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9096095 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEP. 30, 2020 The Petitioner, an information technology solutions provider, seeks to temporarily employ the Beneficiary as a "sales engineer" under the H-1B nonimmigrant classification for specialty occupations.
