U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 06479121 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 9, 2020 The Applicant seeks T-1 nonimmigrant classification as a victim of human trafficking under sections 101(a)(15)(T) and 214(0) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(T) and 1184(0). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-914, Application for T Nonimmigrant Status (T application), and the matter is now before us on appeal. Upon de nova review, we will remand the appeal. I. LAW Section 101(a)(15)(T)(i) of the Act provides that applicants may be classified as a T-1 nonimmigrant if they: are or have been a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons; are physically present in the United States on account of such trafficking; have complied with any reasonable requests for assistance in the investigation or prosecution of trafficking; and would suffer extreme hardship involving unusual and severe harm upon removal from the United States. See also 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.ll(b)(l)-(4). The term "severe form of trafficking in persons" is defined as "sex trafficking in which a commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion ... or the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage, or slavery. 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(a) (2017). The burden of proof is on an applicant to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(d)(5); Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). An applicant may submit any credible evidence for us to consider; however, we determine, in our sole discretion, the evidentiary weight to give that evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.ll(d)(5). The Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) reviews the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christa's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015).
