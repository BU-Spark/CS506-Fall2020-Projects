U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6416802 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 30, 2020 Form 1-485, Application for Adjustment of Status of Alien in U Nonimmigrant Status The Applicant seeks to become a lawful permanent resident (LPR) under section 245(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255(m), based on her "U" nonimmigrant status. The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-485, Application for Adjustment of Status of Alien in U Nonimmigrant Status (U adjustment application). On appeal, the Applicant submits a statement reasserting her eligibility. The Administrative Appeals Office reviews the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may adjust the status of a U nonimmigrant to that of an LPR if she meets all other eligibility requirements and, "in the opinion" ofUSCIS, her "continued presence in the United States is justified on humanitarian grounds, to ensure family unity, or is otherwise in the public interest." Section 245(m) of the Act. The applicant bears the burden of establishing her eligibility pursuant to section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1361, and must do so by a preponderance of the evidence. Matter ofChawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369,375 (AAO 2010). This burden includes establishing that discretion should be exercised in her favor, and USCIS may consider all relevant factors-favorable and adverse-when exercising its discretion. 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(l l). The absence of compelling adverse factors may be sufficient to merit a favorable exercise of administrative discretion. See Matter of Arai, 13 I&N Dec. 494, 496 (BIA 1970) (stating "[i]n the absence of adverse factors, adjustment will ordinarily be granted, still as a matter of discretion."). Where adverse factors are present, a U nonimmigrant may submit evidence to establish mitigating equities. 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.24(d)(l l). II. ANALYSIS The Applicant, a native and citizen of Mexico, last entered the United States without inspection, admission, or parole in 2008. In May 2011, the Applicant was the victim of domestic violence and assisted law enforcement in the investigation of the offense. The Director approved the Applicant's petition for U nonimmigrant status on this basis in October 2013. The Applicant filed the instant U adjustment application in October 2017.
