U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 6723753 Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 1, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition). The Director concluded that the U petition was not approvable because the record did not establish the Petitioner was the victim of qualifying criminal activity and had suffered substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of such criminal activity. On appeal, the Petitioner asserts his eligibility for U nonimmigrant status. We review the questions in this matter de nova. See Matter of Christa's Inc., 26 l&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will remand the matter to the Director. I. LAW Section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Act provides U-1 nonimmigrant classification to victims of qualifying crimes who suffer substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of the offense. These victims must also possess information regarding the qualifying crime and be helpful to law enforcement officials in their investigation or prosecution of it. Id. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has sole jurisdiction over U petitions and the petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate eligibility by a preponderance of the evidence. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(4); Matter of Chawathe, 25 &N Dec. 369, 375 AAO 2010). As a part of meeting this burden, a petitioner must submit a Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Supplement B), from a law enforcement official certifying a petitioner's helpfulness in the investigation or prosecution of the qualifying criminal activity. Section 214(p)(l) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). Although a petitioner may submit any relevant, credible evidence for us to consider, USCIS determines, in its sole discretion, the credibility of and weight given to all the evidence, including the Supplement B. II. ANALYSIS The Petitioner filed his U petition in 2015, along with a Supplement B that indicated that he was the victim of criminal activity involving or similar to felonious assault and "related crimes."
