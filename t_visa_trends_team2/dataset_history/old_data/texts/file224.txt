U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 1421030 Appeal of Nebraska Service Center Decision Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JULY 23, 2020 The Petitioner seeks "U-1" nonimmigrant classification as a victim of qualifying criminal activity under sections 101(a)(15)(U) and 214(p) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act), 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(U) and 1184(p). The Director of the Nebraska Service Center denied the Petitioner's Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition), and the matter is before us on appeal. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW The U-1 classification affords nonimmigrant status to victims of qualifying criminal activity who suffer substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of the crime. Section 101(a)(15)(U)(i) of the Act; see also 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(14) (defining "victim of qualifying criminal activity" generally as "an alien who has suffered direct and proximate harm as a result of the commission of qualifying criminal activity."). To be eligible for U-1 nonimmigrant status, the petitioner must also possess information about the qualifying crime and be helpful to appropriate officials in their investigation or prosecution of the crime. 1 Id. AU petition must be filed with a Form 1-918 Supplement B, U Nonimmigrant Status Certification (Supplement B) by a "Federal, State, or local law enforcement official, prosecutor, judge, or other Federal, State, or local authority investigating criminal activity" and signed by a certifying official within six months immediately preceding the filing of the U petition. Section 214(p)(l) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). See also 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(3)(i) (defining "certifying official," as relevant here, as "[t]he head of the certifying agency, or any person(s) in a supervisory role who has been specifically designated by the head of the certifying agency to issue U nonimmigrant status certifications on behalf of that agency .... "). The Supplement B must certify that the petitioner was a victim of qualifying criminal activity that the certifying agency is investigating or prosecuting, possesses information about the crime, and "has been, is being, or is likely to be helpful" in the investigation or prosecution of the crime. Section 214(p)(l) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(c)(2)(i). 1 The regulatory definition of "investigation or prosecution" includes the "detection" of qualifying criminal activity. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(a)(5).
