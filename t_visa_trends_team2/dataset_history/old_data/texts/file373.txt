U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9019649 Appeal of National Benefits Center Decision Form 1-485, Application to Adjust Status Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 16, 2020 The Applicant is a citizen of Bangladesh who seeks lawful permanent resident status under section 13 of the 1957 Immigration Act (Section 13). 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255b. Section 13 allows a foreign national who was previously an A-1, A-2, G-1, or G-2 nonimmigrant to adjust status if certain criteria are met.1 The Director of the National Benefits Center denied the application, concluding that the Applicant did not establish, as required, that his diplomatic status was terminated before he applied for adjustment in 2016. On appeal, the Applicant submits a copy of his passport and asserts that he was last admitted to the United States as a G-1 nonimmigrant in 2014, and that he is therefore eligible to adjust status under Section 13. In these proceedings, it is the Applicant's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1361. Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal because the Applicant has not met this burden. I. LAW Section 13 is an adjustment of status category for foreign nationals who can demonstrate, in part: ( 1) failure to maintain A-1, A-2, G-1, or G-2 nonimmigrant status as of the application's filing date; (2) performance of diplomatic or semi-diplomatic duties by the principal on behalf of the accrediting country; and (3) inability, because of compelling reasons, to return to the country that accredited the foreign national. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1255b(b); 8 C.F.R. ยง 245.3.2 1 Pub. L. No. 85-316, 71 Stat. 642, amended by Pub. L. No. 97-116, 95 Stat. 161 (1981). The A nonimmigrant classification is for diplomats and foreign government officials (principal) as well as their immediate family members. The G nonimmigrant classification is for employees of certain international organizations (principal) and their immediate family members. See https://travel.state.gov. 2 If the first three eligibility requirements are met, applicants must also establish that compelling reasons demonstrate that their adjustment would be in the national interest and would not be contrary to the national welfare, safety, or security of the United States and that they are of good moral character and admissible to the United States. Discussion of these remaining criteria is generally unnecessary in cases where the first three eligibility criteria have not been met.
