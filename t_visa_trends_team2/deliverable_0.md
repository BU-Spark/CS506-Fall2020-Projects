# Trends in T-Visa Applications
### Motivation:
There has been an increase in denials in T-Visa applications (there are 5,000 available per year). Never have more than 1,000 been granted in a year and the past few years have seen both an increase in applications and an increase in denials. There is a hypothesis that the increase in denials is related to procedural barriers that immigration is constructing to make it more difficult to for applications to find success.

### Project goal:
