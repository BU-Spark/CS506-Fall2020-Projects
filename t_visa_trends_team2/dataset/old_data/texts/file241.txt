U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9868457 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Form 1-129, Petition for E-2 Treaty Investor Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 24, 2020 The Applicant, an "on-demand" car rental service, seeks to employ the Beneficiary in the United States as its "Director" in the nonimmigrant classification of an E-2 Treaty Investor, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §§ 214.2(e)(20) and (21). In accordance with the regulations, the application for a change of status and extension of stay was filed on Form 1-129, Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker. See 8 C.F.R. § 214. l(c)(l). The Director of the California Service Center denied the application. The matter is now before us on appeal. The appeal will be rejected. Pursuant to the regulations at 8 C.F.R. § 214.l(c)(S) there is no appeal from the denial of an application for an extension of status of an E-1 or E-2 treaty trader or treaty investor. We note that there is no petition requirement for E-2 Treaty Investors and there is no petition determination that may be appealed. When it published the Final Rule governing the nonimrnigrant classification, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (former INS, now USCIS) noted: [U]nder section 103 of the Act, the service has exclusive jurisdiction to adjudicate applications for admission to this country, as well as applications for change of nonimrnigrant status to, or extensions of stay in, E nonirnmigrant classification. In this regard, it should be noted that, unlike other employment-driven classifications, E nonimrnigrant visa classification is not conferred by means of a petition, but instead by an application. 62 Fed. Reg. 48138 (Sept. 12, 1997). Although an appeal was subsequently filed, it must be rejected pursuant to the regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 214.l(c)(S), which states: Decision in Form 1-129 or 1-539 extension proceedings. Where an applicant or petitioner demonstrates eligibility for a requested extension, it may be granted at the discretion of the Service. There is no appeal from the denial of an application for extension of stay filed on Form 1-129 or 1-539.
