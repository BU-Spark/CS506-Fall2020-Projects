U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 9001177 Appeal of Texas Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 24, 2020 Form 1-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker (Extraordinary Ability) The Petitioner, a manufacturer of generic prescription drugs, seeks to classify the Beneficiary as an alien of extraordinary ability. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 203(b )(1 )(A), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1153(b)(l)(A).
