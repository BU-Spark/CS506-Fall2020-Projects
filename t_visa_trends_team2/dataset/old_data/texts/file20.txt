U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 4615621 Appeal of Vermont Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: JUNE 8, 2020 Form 1-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant The Petitioner, who was granted lawful permanent residency based on her "U-1" nonimmigrant status, seeks immigrant classification of the Derivative, her spouse, as a qualifying family member. See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) section 245(m)(3), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(m)(3) (outlining eligibility for classification). The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-929, Petition for Qualifying Family Member of a U-1 Nonimmigrant (U immigrant petition), concluding that the record did not establish the Derivative's eligibility. The matter is now before us on appeal. On appeal, the Petitioner submits a brief and additional evidence. In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish eligibility for the requested benefit. 8 C.F.R. § 214.14(£)(5); Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375 (AAO 2010). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW Individuals who gain their lawful permanent residency through their U-1 status may seek lawful permanent residency on behalf of a qualifying family member who has never held derivative U nonimmigrant status if granting the immigrant status would avoid extreme hardship to either the U-1 principal or the qualifying family member. Section 245(m)(3) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(g). Even if hardship is established, ultimately, a petitioner bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) should exercise its discretion and adjust the status of a qualifying family member, including his or her spouse. Section 245(m)(3) of the Act; 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(a)(2), (h)(l)(v). USCIS may consider all factors when making its discretionary decision, including acts that would otherwise render a qualifying family member inadmissible and mitigating circumstances when there are adverse factors. 8 C.F.R. § 245.24(h)(l)(v). Depending on the nature of the adverse factors, a petitioner may be required to clearly demonstrate that the denial of adjustment of status would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship.
