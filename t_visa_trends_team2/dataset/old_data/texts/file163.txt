U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services In Re: 8867698 Appeal of California Service Center Decision Non-Precedent Decision of the Administrative Appeals Office Date: SEPT. 4, 2020 Form 1-360, Petition for Special Immigrant Religious Worker The Petitioner, a church, seeks to classify the Beneficiary as a special immigrant religious worker to perform services as an "Ordained Church Pastor." See Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act) Section 203(b)(4), 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(4). This immigrant classification allows non-profit religious organizations, or their affiliates, to employ foreign nationals as ministers, in religious vocations, or in religious occupations in the United States. See Section 101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(C)(ii). The Director of the California Service Center denied the petition, concluding that the Petitioner did not show the Beneficiary possessed the requisite two-year qualifying religious work experience, as required under 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(m)(4). See also 8 C.F.R. § 204.5(m)(2). The Petitioner appeals, submitting a short statement on the Form l-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion, but no additional evidence. In these proceedings, it is the Petitioner's burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, its eligibility for the requested benefit. Section 291 of the Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1361; Matter of Skirball Cultural Ctr., 25 l&N Dec. 799, 806 (AAO 2012); Matter of Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. 369, 375-76 (AAO 2010).1 Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I. LAW Foreign nationals who perform full-time, compensated religious work as ministers, in religious vocations, or in religious occupations for non-profit religious organizations in the United States may be classified as special immigrant religious workers. The petitioner must establish that the foreign national beneficiary meets certain eligibility criteria, including membership in a religious denomination and continuous religious work experience for at least the two-year period before the petition filing date. See generally Section 203(b)(4) of the Act (providing classification to qualified special immigrant religious workers as described in Section 101(a)(27)(C)(ii) of the Act). 1 If a petitioner submits relevant, probative, and credible evidence that leads us to believe that the claim is "more likely than not" or "probably" true, it has satisfied the preponderance of the evidence standard. Chawathe, 25 l&N Dec. at 375-76.
