The Director of the Vermont Service Center denied the Form 1-918, Petition for U Nonimmigrant Status (U petition).

The Administrative Appeals Office reviews the questions in this matter de nova. Matter of Christo 's Inc., 26 I&N Dec. 537, 537 n.2 (AAO 2015). Upon de nova review, we will dismiss the appeal. I.
