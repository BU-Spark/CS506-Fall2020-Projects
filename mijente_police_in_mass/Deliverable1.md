## Preliminary Analysis

### Step1: Data Processing

1. We filtered out state executive office holders by their CPF IDs on the Police OCPF dataset and master OCPF dataset.
2. From 'Active_Senator_Contributions 2010-2020.csv', we filter out rows that has "Police" as Contributor and created dictionary containing their donation amount corresponding to CPF IDs
3. We summarized cities top donors, which of them were the top recipients of police contributions.
4. We then created bar charts and pie charts to representing the summaries

### Step2: Observations from data analysis and visualization

1. According to the visualization, most of the recipients receive similar amount of donations during 2010-2020, which was not more than $100000
2. Similar things happen when only counting the donation from police, most of them won't receive more than $20000
3. Most organizations won't receive more than 10% of the donation from police, but a few of them have very high percentage instead
4. Boston, Roslindale, and Lowell are the top 3 cities in MA that has the highest donation amount from police
