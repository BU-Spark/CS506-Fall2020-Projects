While working in my capacity as the School Resource Officer at the
Consentino school on Tuesday 01/09/2018 at approximately 0900hrs this
Officer had walked into the main office and was met by RP (Assistant
Principal Richard Poor) who had the defendant, sitting in
the conference room. This Officer noticed the defendant appeared to be
very agitated and angry. RP (Poor) advised there had been an incident
upstairs with the defendant that seemed as though her behavior was
becoming more defiant and she had taken the next step ramping up her
negative behavior.
At this point RP (Poor) showed this Officer a conversation from the V
(8th grade English Teacher Sarah Foley) that stated she was going to punch
V (Foley) if she, V (Foley), did not get out of the defendant face. Upon
speaking with V (Foley) it was learned that class pictures were today for the
annual yearbook. V(Foley) had requested the defendant get into line for the
pictures and the defendant's reply was ""Can you wait!"" V (Foley) then
responded to the defendant asking her to calm down. At this point the
defendant then ""you calm down you stupid bitch, get out of my face before I
punch you!""
V was taken aback by the defendant words and immediately contacted
RP (Poor) who removed the defendant from the area and she was
subsequently disciplined by school officials. PA, her mother was contacted
and came to school to pick-up the defendant. PA was advised that this
Officer would be seeking a complaint in court against the defendant. At this
time a summons is requested against the defendant for the following:

was in my office when the Fire Alarm sounded. I had noticed a student, the
defendant was with staff, Andy Bonifacio, in the area of
room K-10 near the stairs.
The alarm was called in as a fire alarm pull from the area of K-10, near
the stairs. I checked video and saw the defendant try to walk through the
doors by the stairs in an attempt to go downstairs. When Andy blocked her
from doing so the defendant walked to the fire alarm, approximately two
feet away, and pulled the alarm. The defendant then left the building and
Andy followed.
I spoke with Andy once the alarms had reset and all two thousand staff
and students returned to class. Andy states that had been
refusing for almost two hours to go to class. Andy states when he finally got
to go upstairs she tried to go back down through the doorway he
blocked. Andy states that is when pulled the alarm, then exited
the building. Andy states did not make any threats to pull the
alarm prior to pulling it.

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer at the
Consentino school on Thursday 01/17/2019 at approximately 0930hrs there
was a call on the school portable radio advising a student was in the gym
area without permission to do so. This incident went on for the next half
hour with W (SPED ESP Alex Cederstrom) and IP (Principal John Mele)
going back and forth about how to address the defendant,
behavior. Various other staff members had made attempts to have
the defendant return to class but he refused.
At approximately 0950hrs this Officer as well as IP (Mele) went to the
gym to try to reason with the defendant to return to class. At that time
another student had come into the gym and was asked to return to class,
that stude4nt did comply with the request. Myself and IP (Mele) spent
several minutes trying to convince the defendant that it would be in his best
interest to return to class but he refused. The defendant then began to use
derogatory names calling this Officer and IP (Mele) bitches. At one point he
threw a basketball at the wall barely missing IP (Mele).
Finally the defendant did exit the gym area but he then began to
wander the school building, swearing at staff, shutting off lights and
disrupting the building. This Officer continued to follow the defendant to
ensure his safety and those of the other staff as well as students in the
building. At one point the defendant then turned the corner of the main
hallway with W (Cederstrom) close behind, he then entered the officer of
the assistant principal and proceeded to pull a poster off the wall and knock
over the trash spilling its contents on the floor of the office. W
(Cederstrom) was right there and observed these actions by the defendant.
The defendant has been given a great deal of leeway and his class
schedule has been adjusted several times in an effort to offer him more
support to be successful in class but he continues to have a complete
disregard for the rules. On Wednesday 01/16/20919 at approximately this
Officer was in the building near the gym area and observed the defendant
writing with a marker on the doors of thew gym. When confronted his
answer was that other students had done this already. At the time the
defendant was given consequences and asked to clean the writing off the
door which he refused to do.
The defendant has repeatedly refused to comply with the simplest
request of the staff in the building and then will use derogatory language to
describe staff members. During the book process the defendant refused to
comply with this Officer's directions to sit down and not touch the computer
equipment. The defendant continued to insult this Officer repeatedly
during the booking process by calling the Officer SPED and a fat fuck
several times. After finding no alternative the defendant was then placed
under arrest and transported to the station.
Once at the station the defendant was advised of his constitutional and
statutory rights as well as his right to a phone call by the OIC Lt. Leeman.
He was booked and PA ( his mother, was contacted and
advised she would need to be in court. The defendant is charged with the

assigned to car #6 Day Shift was dispatched to the Haverhill High School
skating rink for two students assaulting staff and were now being
restrained. Also sent to the call as backup was car #19 Officer Cooper.
Upon my arrival both students were lying on the ground and seem to be in a
calm state. I asked what was going on and Teacher/Victim Michael
Sigsworth asked if we could speak privately as he did not want to get the
students upset again. Officer Cooper was on scene along with staff to stay
with the students.
I then spoke with Sigsworth on what happened. Sigsworth explained that he
takes the kids skating up at the rink and today student/defendant
came as well. is currently dating defendant,
and both were not skating. was apparently holding on to
money when he wanted to get a snack at the vending machine.
According to the teacher/victim 3 Devyn Mangrum she overheard
saying to ""give me my money or I'll Knock your fucking head off.""
This is when Mangrum intervenes to tell not to use this language
and she is then shoved by Sigsworth then gets off the ice to go over
and get in the middle of the situation.
Sigsworth said he took out of the ice rink and into the waiting area
and did get him to calm down when then came screaming into the
waiting area with both Mangrum and victim 2, Chelsey Howell attempting
to restrain her and stop her. This then gets wound up again and he
begins to start yelling at Mangrum and Howell to get off of when
he begins to get up and go after the ladies. Sigsworth attempts to grab at
to restrain him when tries to get Sigsworth off of him he
ends up elbowing Sigsworth in the face. Sigsworth then restrains to
the ground, which then set off and Howell then had to restrain
to the ground. In that process was pushing and shoving

Howell and Howell's hand was hurt in that incident.
All parties declined any type of medical services. And at this point the
school was requesting we escort the two individuals back to the school as
they did not feel comfortable transporting them back in the school van with
the other students and staff. And once back at the school they would call
their parents and handle it from there.

The students did not have class in this area and should not have been there.
Security brought them to the main office. Matt states he spoke with and
searched each of the students. Matt states it is common practice to search
students found skipping in the locker room, due to the high theft rate in the
area.
Matt states the boys told him they were skipping class and went down to
the locker room to use the bathroom. and stated that
used the bathroom and they waited, while the defendant,
walked away.

Matt contacted me about the recovered stolen Iphone and I came to the
main office. I met with the victim, at that time and he
confirmed the phone Matt found on was his. and I searched
the locker room for his missing SIM card, but could not find it. When a cell
phone is stolen the thief will take the SIM card out so Find my Iphone, and
other tracking apps, can not locate the phone. will make
arrangements with his cell carrier to get a new SIM card for the phone.

Gang Unit was working the day shift (0830-1630). I was operating in plain
clothes capacity in an unmarked cruiser. At approximately 1212 hrs patrol
was dispatched to St. James Alternative School (415 Primrose St), for a
report of an out of control juvenile DOB 12/28/02. It should
be noted that is a validated gang member (Gangster Disciple) and has
been causing many issues at the school throughout this year. I am familiar
with due prior dealings with him. Patrol officers were notified by the

his cell-phone it is the policy of the school to not allow cell-phone usage
during school hours. was prompted by Cherie to turn over his cell-
phone per the school policy. became aggressive toward Cherie, and
threw a chair across the room placing her in fear of being struck . He then
proceeded to charge at Cherie, in an aggressive manner while stating ""move
out of my fucking way, you bitch"". then placed both his hands of
Cherie's shoulders while making statements about physically moving
Cherie, from the doorway.Cheri than advised that he needs to calm
down and control himself. than proceeded to sit in Cherie's chair and
used her phone stating ""I'm calling my Mom."" never made the phone
call. than continued his aggressive behavior with telling Cherie, to
move out of the doorway. then shoved Cherie out of the doorway to get
outside of the room without permission. then continued his tirade in
the school halls. continued to threaten Cherie, that he was going to
punch her. was calling Cherie, derogatory names like ""fucking dyke
and fucking hoe."" was being very disruptive to other children that were
in their classes. then walked into his 5th period class with Jessica
Wright (Witness) who is a teacher. Jessica than prompted to follow
through with turning over his phone, and to meet with Cherie. than
aggressively through a chair across the room and continued to escalate
further with his behavior in that hallway. than approached the
problem solving door while continuing to call Cherie derogatory names and
proceeded to demand that Cherie, open the door. Cherie than asked that
meet with her at the teacher prep room. Cherie than opened the door
and stepped away from the door. While Cherie was inside the door
began to aggressively kick at the door multiple times which caused the
doorknob to slam into Cherie's right side. continued to kick the door
into Cherie. Jessica than observed kicking the door into Cherie and
observed that the force from the door being kicked into Cherie caused her
body to move. than continued to kick the door even after Jessica
advised him to stop. stated that he did not care and that he will
continue to do it. At this time another student enter the room, than
took a hold of the door and aggressively pushed the door attempting to get

other kids that were in the room by his words. Jessica then from outside the
room continued to interrupt access to the room. than
aggressively pushed his body into Jessica, and postured toward her while
threatening physical harm. Due to his behavior it was decided that the
police be contacted. than left the building and was escorted home by
Patrol Officers.
It should be noted that aggressive behavior towards staff has been
increasing throughout past few months. It has caused staff to be placed in
fear when dealing with him. has also in the past been outright about
his involvement in gangs and his family and friends being involved in gangs.
I took a report involving on 01/15/2019, in which is overheard by
another student discussing a gang shooting and making threats about the
victim, of the shooting stating his boys will finish him off someday. (See

On Thursday May 2, 2019 I was working my assigned Day shift in marked
cruiser #19. At approximately 1100 hours I was dispatched to the lobby of
the police station to take a report of an assault that occurred on April 2,
2019. The listed Victim, Joseph Gello (DOB 12/03/1962) is an employee at
St. James School, 415 Primrose Street. Gello stated that he was assaulted by
the listed Defendant, (DOB 03/14/2007) who is listed as a
13 year old high functioning autistic male. It should be noted that police
have been called to St. James School numerous times to assist staff with out
of control students and disturbances.
Gello stated that on 04/02/2019 he was working in the school when at
approximately 1440 hours was causing problems in a classroom and
was moved to the hallway. then began to antagonize two other
students in the classroom across the hall. The two other unknown students
exited their classroom and attempted to get to was
subsequently punched in the face by one of the student and Gello
intervened. Gello moved down the hall to a speech therapy room
where listed Witness, Jonathan Rousseau (DOB 02/24/1986) was working.
Gello stated that was very aggitated and was holding his face and
pacing back and forth. Gello stated that the other students that were
involved in the fight were outside yelling for to exit the room. Gello
stated that he stood in front of the door to prevent from leaving and
reengaging the other students. Gello stated that he turned toward the door
and when he did punched him on the right side of the head, striking
him in the ear and neck area. Gello stated that he was dazed and nearly lost
consciousness. Other staff members were alerted and responded to the
incident to move to another area of the building. Gello stated that he
suffered serious pain and was eventually diagnosed with a grade 2
concussion. Gello stated that he attempted to return to work approximately
2 weeks later, but when he did the symptoms of the concussion seemed to
become more intense. When asked, he stated that he waited so long to
report the assault because he was suffering from the affects of the
concussion and was trying to deal with that before anything else. Gello
stated that after was moved he was told that admitted to
punching Gello because he wanted to go back into the hallway and continue
the fight. Gello stated that said that he knew that they only way to
get past Gello was to knock him out.
I responded to St. James School in an attempt to speak with the listed
witnesses. I met with Rousseau who's statement regarding the assault that
occurred in speech therapy room matched Gello's. Rousseau stated that
since it had happened a month ago all the details of the entire incident were
difficult for him to remember. I then spoke with Involved Party, Anna
Linnehan (DOB 03/24/1977) who stated that she was not there for the
initial disturbance or the assault on Gello. Linnehan stated that she was
called to the room to move after the assault had occurred. I
attempted to speak with Involved Party, Lyn Snow (DOB 12/12/1975) but
she was out of the building. Her secretary told me that she was over at the
Central office for the school department and that she would meet me
immediately.
I continued to City Hall in the School Department office to meet with Snow.
When I asked questions about the assault she stated that ""she would not call
it an assault"". Snow stated that she was not there for the incident but was
notified of it and that a report was generated. Snow stated that she would
provide me with a copy of the report for continuity of reporting. Snow
stated that school protocol is to not block the exit of an escalated student.
She stated that typically they allow the escalated student to leave and have a
staff member shadow them. Snow stated that she had also contacted
mother and notified her of the incident.

Based on the information above and mental capacity, I am
respectfully requesting a hearing to determine if there is probable cause for
the charge of:

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer at the
Consentino school on Wednesday 04/11/2018 at approximately 0945hrs
this Officer was contacted by IP #2, the testing coordinator (Dr. Erin
Hagerty), in regards to the defendant who was being
disruptive in the hallways. The defendant has an issue with following to
comply with staff directives for sometime. He was recently placed on a long
term because of his disruptive behavior in the school. The past two weeks
has been the MCAS period opened by the state DESE for testing of students
at the school and special accommodations were made for the defendant.
On Monday the defendant walked around the for the better part of
three (3) hours while having to be followed by IP #1 (Adjustment Counselor
Brian Hammond) and this Officer as well, during that time testing was also
taking place all over the school. The defendant was banging on lockers and
refusing to follow staff instruction to return to IP #2 (Hammond) office.
Several staff members attempted to negotiate his return to the office but
unless it was on his terms he would not comply.
This morning this Officer arrived in the area of the guidance office and
once again found the defendant milling about the area refusing to begin
testing. Once again there were many students in the building testing and a
quiet environment is necessary for them to be successful. IP #2
(Hammond) was once again negotiating with the defendant to begin the test
and once again every request was met with a condition. This Officer also
tried reasoning with the defendant but he would not comply with basic
requests to enter the office.
IP #2 (Hammond) stated a plan had been formalized with PA (
that if he refused she was to be called and would give the okay for
him to walk home. IP #2 (Hammond) did give him several more minutes to
comply with the request but then he refused to turn over his cell phone
which is required by the state for testing to be valid. The defendant did
finally go into the 6th grade wing, where testing was being conducted and
signs were posted to remain quiet and became disrupted. He began yelling
right outside one of the classrooms were kids were testing.
At this point IP #2 (Hammond) made the decision to contact PA
( for the okay to send the defendant home and upon her request to
speak with him he immediately hung-up on her forcing IP #12 (Hammond)
to call back. PA ( did give permission for him to walk home but
once again he refused and was causing a disruption in the hallway outside of
the guidance officer where several students were taking the test because of
special accommodations. This Officer was then contacted by IP #1
(Hagerty) for assistance.
Upon this Officer arrival once again this Officer tried reasoning with
the defendant to leave the school as instructed by his mother and staff
members. He was caution about his actions and if he continued to act out
the consequences he would face but he stated several times he did not care
he was not leaving. At this point he was advised he was being placed under
arrest. As I attempted to handcuff the defendant he became resistant to this
Officer but I was finally able to place both cuffs on the defendant. The
defendant refused to walk from the building with the Officer and nearly had
to be dragged out to my cruiser. The station was contacted and advised of
the arrest.
Upon arrival at the station the defendant continued his defiant
behavior during the booking process. It was necessary to take his picture
several times as he refused to comply with requests. Lt. Leeman advised the
defendant of his constitutional and statutory rights as well as his right to a
phone call. PA ( was contacted and advised of the situation and
advised she would need to be in court today. He was then booked and taken
to Lawrence Juvenile court. The defendant is charged with the following:

office I asked if he had anything on him that would jam him up,
said ""no."" I told he has nothing to worry about then and we continued
to the office. Once there the RP, Principal Glen Burns, engaged and I
left the area.
Approximately ten or so minutes later I was called to the Main Office by
Matt Steinberg for assistance. When I arrived Matt was not in the office,
but Glen Burns was. Glen had five boxes of THC vape cartridges on his desk
containing three to nine cartridges in each box. Glen states when he
searched he found these cartridges in his backpack.
Glen went on to say that while investigating a vaping incident earlier
today where the fire alarm was triggered in one of the bathrooms, he
learned that had posted a Snapchat. Glen states in the Snapchat he
saw it was from to another student and it was a picture of
several THC vape cartridges with an elastic around it, it had a banner across
the picture that said LMK (slang for let me know) Glen noticed the picture
was taken in one of our HHS bathrooms and posted approximately an hour
before the alarms went off. Glen states that is why they called for to
come to the main office.
When I saw the items Glen had found on I knew them to be a
controlled class C substance. From my training and experience I knew the
amount had on him is more than for personal use. initially was
found to have 21 suspected Vape THC cartridges in his property. I know
that the cartridges sell for approximately $20.00 to $40.00 a piece in the
schools. This amount of cartridges would be much more than personal use
for an individual high school student. These cartridges have a high level of
THC in them and there have been examples of school aged children
overdosing from the high levels of THC. The THC cartridges are considered
a Class C drug instead of Class D in Massachusetts because it is a THC
concentrate.

handcuffed. I also advised that he would be searched and asked him if
he had anything else on him. then removed eight more cartridges
from his pants and handed them to me.
I asked Matt to forward me the Snapchat they had, when I saw the
picture it was clear that the bundle of various cartridges in the picture was
the same bundle that had handed me. From my training and

were eight different flavors in the bundle. The ""LMK"" on the Snapchat is

report of threats. Upon my arrival I was met by R1, John DePolo, the
principal of St James School, about a report of a female student that had a
threatening text on her phone.
R1 stated that he was approached prior to school starting on 08/31/2018,
by V1, a student at St James, that she had received a text
message from D1, a male student at St James, that he was
going to shoot her. R1 stated that V1 received the text message on
08/30/2018 at approximately 1551hrs while she was not in school or on
school property. R1 stated that he did speak with V1 and her mother,

about the incident.

R1 stated that the called for a mediation between V1 and D1 in school. R1
stated that she spoke with both V1 and D1 via a mediation and stated that
D1 apologized to V1 about his text and that he had no intent to harm V1 and
that he said he ""had a lot going on"" and knew that it was wrong to say. R1
states that V1 accepted D1 apology and that she felt safe. R1 states that he
did a consent search of D1 and his belongings and did not locate any
contraband or weapons on D1. R1 stated that he then sent V1 and D1 back
to their respective classes in school. R1 states that the then called police.
I spoke with R1 and he stated that he spoke with both students and their
parents about the situation. R1 stated that he also wanted to report the

stated that he would bring them into his office one at a time.
I spoke with D1 who stated that he did send the message that he would
shoot V1 but he did not mean to. D1 stated that he had ""a lot going on"" and
he did not mean to talk to V1 in that manner. D1 stated that he did not have
access nor did he ever own or in possession of a gun. R1 stated that he knew
it was wrong and he would not harm anyone. R1 was the sent back to class.
R1 then brought V1 into his office. V1 stated that she did have an
exchange of text messages with D1 and she felt it ""got out of hand"" and
""things were said"". V1 did show this officer the message, which is attached
to this report, stating ""if you expose me I'll fucking shoot you with me 32"",
and a second one stating ""I will shoot you shorty don't fwm"".
V1 stated that she did have a mediation with R1 and D1 and that D1
apologized to her and she was satisfied with an apology. V1 stated that she

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer at the
Consentino school on Thursday 09/14/2017 at approximately 1230hrs this
Officer was out at lunch recess when RP (Katie Hill), the school Librarian,
observed several students in the grass field acting suspiciously. RP (Hill)
alerted this Officer to the event so I began to walk in that direction.
Upon arriving I spoke with IP # 1 ( and IP #2 (
IP #2 ( was instructed to return to the cafeteria as it was lunch
time for the 7th grade and that was where he was supposed to be. The other
group of students came over and handed this Officer a small baby rabbit
that appeared to be shaking and scared. This Officer immediately called IP
#5 (Michelle Hamel) to take possession of the wild animal. This officer
later learned she released the rabbit in the area of her office on Downing
Ave in an effort to let it survive.
While waiting for IP #5(Hamel) to arrive at the school IP #1 (
came to this Officer to explain what had happened. She stated the JR
Football team was practicing at the field behind Silver Hill school on
Wednesday 09/13/2017, when one of the players inadvertently stepped on
the nest. This Officer was told that one of the rabbits was killed by this
action and the other was the one that I was waiting to hand off to IP #5
(Hamel). At this point this Officer did not have any other information as to
who else was involved or if an actual crime had taken place.
Upon reporting for school on 09/14/2017, Thursday, at approximately
0830hrs this Officer was then approached and given a second baby rabbit.
This Officer then took possession of the rabbit and released it to the ground
and upon doing so this Officer observed the hind legs to be injured. This
Officer once again contacted IP #5 (Hamel) who came to take possession of
the second rabbit. IP #5 (Hamel) was also going to release this rabbit in the
area of her office hoping it could recover from the injuries.
IP #6 (Principal John Mele) earlier had made this Officer aware of a
call from a concerned citizen and after handed off the second rabbit this
Officer called IP #2 ( to his office to speak with him about this
incident. During that conversation he indicated there where two boys who

had abused the rabbits, killing one and injuring the other, he took the other
one home to care for it. He stated one of the defendant's was
but he didn't know the other kids name but IP #3 ( ) knew
who it was and would verify IP #2 ( had not harmed the rabbits.
IP #3 ( ) did in fact corroborate IP #2 ( account of the
events, she stated the other involved youth was a student named but
didn't know his last name. This Officer did a search of the students in the
school named from the 6th grade and she identified the second party
as At this time IP #5 (Hamel) was contacted and we felt
the best approach would be for the law enforcement division of the MSPCA
to get involved in this incident and if warranted they would seek a
complaint in court against both defendants. It was later determined this
Officer would request the summons immediately with the juvenile court.
During the course of the day on 09/15/2017, Friday, this Officer was
receiving conflicting reports about either there being pictures of the abuse
of the rabbits or a video. This Officer spoke with IP #4 (
who confirmed defendant involvement in the event. He was asked if
he was aware of any pictures or video of the event but was not aware. Later
that evening while off duty this Officer saw IP #1 ( and IP #2 (
near the school and stopped to inquire about a video of the event. IP #2
( did in fact have a video and sent it to this Officer's phone.
On the morning of 09/16/2017 Saturday at approximately 0800hrs this
Officer spoke with IP #5 (Hamel) who pointed out where she had released
the two rabbits. Upon doing so she indicated they had gotten together and
went under the storage bin near her office. IP #5 (Hamel) further indicated
she had attempted to feed them in an effort to keep them alive. Later on
this day IP #5 (Hamel) contacted this Officer to advise she was obligated to
euthanize the rabbit as it was covered with fly larvae. IP #5 (Hamel) did
send this Officer a picture of this injured rabbit after she had found it prior
to euthanizing it. She then took the other rabbit in for safekeeping in an
effort to keep the last rabbit alive.
On Saturday 09/16/17 at approximately 1600hrs, Saturday, this Officer
reported to the station before the start of my tour of duty and was able to
copy both the picture from IP #5 (Hamel) and the video from IP #2 (
The video shows defendant #1 picking up a live rabbit and throwing it
into the air as high as he could. The ending appears to show a deceased
rabbit laying on the ground.
After the start of my tour of duty this Officer along with Officer Arriaga
went to to speak with PA #1 ( about the
incident. At that time defendant #1 without any prompting from
these Officers, did in fact implicate defendant #2 as the other
involved party in the animal cruelty. We then proceeded to 33 View St and
spoke with PA #2 ( the step-father of defendant #2 PA

#2 denied any involvement of defendant #2, he was advised of the evidence
and told they would be receiving a summons.
This Officer did make two copies of the video and pictures sent to him.
One copy of the disk was placed into the Haverhill police evidence system,
then placed in locker #15. The other copy was kept by this Officer to be

on Friday September 8, 2017, I was notified by administration that a
teachers laptop was missing.
I spoke with HPS technology as well. They stated that the computer was
active in the ""S"" wing after it was reported missing. Administration,
including RP Assistant Principal Mike Rossetti, and Assistant Principal
Ryan Brown, were in the area of the ""S"" wing. Technology advised them
where the computer was last seen and they checked students and
classrooms. In the meantime I checked the area bathrooms and empty
classes to see if the computer could be located. Unfortunately the computer
was not found before the end of the day and was no longer showing on the
HPS wifi, where it was being tracked.
On Monday morning, September 11th, Mike Rossetti advised me he is
doing an investigation and has new information. Rossetti stated he'll
update me when he's done with his investigation.
On Thursday September 14th Mike Rossetti called me into his office and
handed me the stolen Mac lap top computer. He sent me the following
statement.
To whom it may concern,
On Friday, September 8, 2017, I was alerted to an event that had
occurred in which a teachers silver Mac laptop (owned by the school) went
missing from his classroom. During the time it was reported missing,
students in the area were briefly questioned, and if they had a backpack,
were searched by staff. Because he was seen in the area, was
approached and informed his backpack would be searched. He claimed not
to have a backpack.
On Friday when school ended, staff were still unable to locate the laptop.
Upon review, was seen on camera during that time period with a
backpack on and then with no backpack. Upon an interview with me on
Monday September 11, explained that he had no knowledge of the
whereabouts of the laptop nor of who took it.
Over the course of the next two days, investigation of camera footage from
9/8 showed near the room where the laptop was stolen. At one
point footage appears to indicate he entered the room and subsequently left.
A student informed me that was seen at a Haverhill Dunkin
Donuts on the evening of 9/8 with a silver Mac laptop and was seen peeling
the sticker off the bottom (which states: Property of Haverhill Public
Schools and shows a serial number).
I called a meeting for Thursday September 14 to meet with his
father, and stepmother. In the meeting, told many tales, but
finally admitted that he took the laptop. s father arranged for the
laptop to be returned to the school, which it was within the hour, with
minor scratches near where tried to peel the sticker off.
Based on the information provided by Rossetti, I am requesting that
be charged with Larceny over $250.00 for stealing the computer from HHS.

took away the defendant's phone. The defendant was angry about this
action and said in Spanish ""yo voy a cortar a Mr. Rolfe because he took away
my phone!' W ( states she said this in Spanish because she knows

readily admitted to setting the Victim's ( hair on
fire but stated it was an accident as he was trying to scare her not set it on

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer at the
Consentino school on Wednesday 10/11/2017 at the close of school this
Officer was made aware of an assault that had taken place in the stairwell of
the 7th grade wing of the school. Upon responding to the area of Rm #8
this Officer was met by the victim, who was visibly upset. He
stated he had once again been assaulted by defendant and
defendant
This Officer had been contacted by PA ( stating he
would be responding to the school and requesting that I stay here to wait for
him. In the meantime this Officer began to speak to V about the incident. V
states he had gone upstairs to meet his sister for the walk home when he
encountered the defendants. V states when got to the top of the stairs both
were there and they began to assault him. V states defendant threw
him into the brick wall bouncing his head off the wall. He punched V then
with the help of defendant threw him down the stairs. Both
defendants then fled the school running down the stairs and out of the
building. V at the time was offered medical treatment and his father had
refused. PA was advised of his rights to an EHO on behalf of V and signed a
departmental form declining to exercise those rights at this time. He was
further advised he could seek a HO at the juvenile court at a later date if he
wished on behalf of V.
This Officer had been aware of an ongoing issue between V and the
defendants. On 10/06/2017 PA had contacted the station in regards to
another incident that had happened at the end of the school day. At that
time it was learned there had been an incident at football practice that had
made some hard feelings between the boys. PA and his family had tried to
address the issues with the football coaches but were unable to get the
matter resolved. This Officer advised he would speak with the boys on
Tuesday 10/10/2017 when school was back in session.
On Tuesday 10/10/2017 this Officer did meet with both defendants
while at school. at that time this Officer warned both defendants to remain
away from V. They were made aware they could face criminal charges
should the issues continue. However, on 10/11/2017 they chose to take
matters further and did assault and threw him head first into a brick wall.
Since this event had happened it was learned that defendant had
withdrawn from the school and moved to an unknown location in Lawrence.
Defendant resides within close proximity to the V and has refused to
take accountability for his actions. Both defendants were subject to
disclipine from school officials and both parents were advised there would
be court action taken against them.
Based on the fact that defendant whereabouts are unknown at this
time, the seriousness of the incident and the failure of defendant to

accept responsibility for his actions a warrant is requested for the following:

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer at the
Consentino School at approximately 1330hrs RP (8th grade Teacher
Anthony Parolisi) contacted administration to state one of his students was
acting strangely. RP (Parolisi) went on to say he thought there was an odor
of Marijuana near the elevator to the second floor of the building. This
information was relayed to IP #1 (AP Michael Jarvis) and IP #2 (Principal
John Mele).
At this point IP #1 (Jarvis) did in fact check several lockers in this area
but found nothing to corroborate the initial report. At this time we all
returned to our regular duties. Within a short period of time the main office
received another call from RP (Parolisi) stating he had more information in
regards to this incident and in fact had the name of the student who was in
possession of Marijuana. RP stated a named 8th grade student, who wished
to remain anonymous, knew who was in possession of Marijuana. Further
the marijuana was in a backpack in the students locker. This anonymous
named student said the defendant, had the marijuana in a
plastic bag that he/she had seen.
At this point this Officer became involved with the situation and
requested the anonymous named student come down to IP #1 (Jarvis) office
to speak with me. Once there he/her was asked about the marijuana.
He/she stated to this Officer he was walking by the defendant and notice an
odor of Marijuana. HE/she inquired if the defendant was in possession of
Marijuana and the defendant answered that he did have Marijuana in his
backpack in his locker. The defendant went on to say he was selling 14
grams and offered to sell some to this named anonymous student who
declined.
Based on this information this Officer inquired with IP #1 (Jarvis) the
location of the defendant's locker and walked to that area. Upon arrival this
Officer noticed a strong odor of fresh Marijuana, this Officer is very familiar
with odor through my training and experience. The locker was then opened
and the odor becoming stronger and appeared to be coming from a
backpack in the locker. This backpack was taken and brought to IP #1
(Jarvis) office.
Upon arrival at this office the backpack was checked and there were
several items located inside that included: a grinder with a green leafy
substance, several plastic baggies, several zig zag cigar wraps as well as
remnants of wraps as well a plastic bottle. Also inside the backpack was a
3-ring binder with the defendant name, homework papers and his schedule
inside. Upon checking the plastic bottle there was a significant amount of
Marijuana inside, the bottle appeared to be more than half full of a green
leafy substance that appeared to be Marijuana. Based on my training and
experience this Officer knows Marijuana being sold is packaged in large
quantities before being separated to be packaged for sale. The baggies are
used to package the Marijuana, the grinder used to separate the Marijuana
for sale and the wraps to assist when placing the Marijuana in a cigar for
smoking and to try to mask the smell of the Marijuana.
At this point it was determined the defendant would be placed under
arrest and was called down to the office. The contraband was placed in a
Walmart bag and taken by this Officer. The defendant was then advised he
was being placed under arrest and his mother was contacted. This Officer
spoke with PA ( to advise her the defendant would be taken
to the Haverhill Police department and she could meet us there. The
Marijuana was brought to the station and logged into the evidence system
then placed in a locker to be sent for analysis until needed for court. The
paraphernalia was also logged into the evidence system them placed into
the same locker to be held for court.
The defendant was transported to the station and on arrival he was
advised of his constitutional and statutory rights as well as his right to a
phone call by the OIC Lt. Tracy. The defendant was booked without

Officer noticed a shoving match happening in the back corner of the gym
near the doors leading outside of the building. At first this Officer believed
it was just some harmless wrestling between the defendant,
and IP #1 both students at the school.
As this Officer began to move to the area it became apparent the
shoving match was becoming more intense and appeared to be progressing
to a full fledged fight between the students. As this Officer quickly made his
way through the gathering students, who were now encouraging the
participants to continue the fight, both students leaned on the door and fell
out onto the ground. This Officer was able to then separate the parties and

04/05/1959. She gave him an in class assignment. She placed
the papers on his desk. He stated ""Get the fuck away from me or I will
fuckin kill you.""
The victim came into our meeting. They both reported that the defendant
has problems with anger. He has been assigned a school counselor, but he
refuses to speak with the counselor. The RP wanted me to file for a criminal
complaint on the juvenile. I contacted the defendant's mother,

she would be summonsed.

would he comply with staff requests to refrain from disrupting others in the

continuously disrupt the learning process of the other students. His
behavior was not only disruptive but it was increasingly becoming volatile.
The DEF failed to comply and at one point after walking into a classroom
where he wasn't suppose to be he intentionally struck the glass window with
his hand. As a result the glass window broke, the window was shattered and
because of this the window will have to be replaced.

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer at the
Consentino school on Thursday 12/07/2017 at approximately 1400hrs this
Officer was walking from the second floor to the first floor when this Officer
was approached by RP (5th grade Teacher Christine Neira) in regards to
what was originally thought to be a stabbing in her classroom of the victim,
(see her written statement). At this time this Officer instructed
RP (Neira) to bring V to the nurse for medical attention to ensure he did not
suffer a stab wound.
This Officer then called IP (Assistant Principal Mary Ellen Lucas) to
advise her of what had happened. RP (Neira) stated defendant
was the one who had stabbed V while had
brought the knife to school. IP (Lucas) then went to check both defendants
lockers while this Officer responded to the nurse's office to check on V.
Once there it was learned there was no injury to V or any mark left from
the knife. In speaking with V he was unsure if the knife had ever made
contact with his body but stated defendant had made a
motion as if to stab him with the knife and he was afraid to tell anyone that
it had happened. The incident was actually reported by another student
who then reported it to RP (Neira).
After checking on V, this Officer went to the health room to get both
defendants and they were then walked down to the main office. They were
advised to have a seat in separate areas of the office and a staff member kept
an eye on them until IP (Lucas) had finished the search of both lockers.
During this search nothing was located in either of the defendants lockers.
At this point IP (Lucas) returned to the office and began to search
defendant A. as well as his backpack. Nothing was found on his
person or in has backpack and upon being asked by IP (Lucas) about the
incident he denied the entire incident but then stated he had faked the
stabbing using a pencil eraser. He denied ever having possession of the
knife.
Next defendant G was checked and upon looking into the
bottom of his backpack there was a small folding pocket type knife located
that was silver in color. When he was first asked about having an illegal
weapon on school grounds he denied it but then stated he had accidentally
brought a pocket knife to school in his hoodie. He denied telling anyone he
had it or showing it to anyone however after further discussion that story
changed and he said he told defendant A that he had it and
showed him the knife. After further discussion he admitted to talking with
some other friends about having the knife but again denied giving it to
anyone. After further discussion he did admit to showing it to other kids.
The parents of both defendants were contacted and PA (
did in fact respond to the school. She was advised of the events of the day
and advised a complaint would be filed in court against her son. While
speaking with her defendant G was still evasive about what had
happened and continued to change his story. He was subsequently
disciplined by school officials. A parent was contacted and was
advised of the incident, was advised of court action and he was subsequently
disciplined by school officials. A mother did come to the school
on Friday morning and was explained what had happened as well as the fact
that court action would be requested. V parent had been contacted by IP
(Lucas) to advise her of the incident and what steps had been taken as well
as the fact that this Officer would be seeking a complaint in juvenile court
against both defendants. Based on the seriousness of the incident this
Officer is requesting a warrant be issued by the court for the following:

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer on Thursday
12/13/2018 at approximately 1040hrs this Officer was contacted by RP
(Principal John Mele) in regards to the defendant,
who was roaming the hallways refusing staff instruction. This was the first
time RP (Mele) came to get this Officer while this Officer was teaching a 6th
grade class. RP (Mele) left as this Officer was unavailable at that moment.
Within a few short minutes once again the class was interrupted by RP
(Mele) again in an effort to help redirect the defendant. This Officer was
still with the class but was able to finish up the class in order to help with
getting the defendant to leave the building and go home. This program has
the approval of PA ( his mother. The defendant is on a
modified school day program because of his inability to remain in class.
Part of his plan is if he begins to act out he is instructed to gather his
belongings and leave the building. He has frequent outbursts that disrupt
the learning process and refuses to follow staff instruction. He leaves the
classroom without permission and usually proceeds to SSC (Student
support center) and disrupts that class.
On this date he reported to have become frustrated and wanted to take
a break but he was found running through the hallways. V #1 (Jeremiah
Arriaga) is the security officer on scene at the school and he was instructed
by RP (Mele) to stay with the defendant as his behavior was becoming more
outrageous. During the course of this interaction he did in fact threaten to
have someone choke out V #1 (Arriaga). At this point he was told he needed
to leave the building and return home but he refused to go home stating he
had done nothing wrong.
V #1 (Arriaga) and RP (Mele) had informed this Officer of the behavior
of the defendant. He was swearing in the hallways, disrupting classes and
refusing to go to the area where he was being directed. He was calling V #1
(Arriaga), RP (Mele) and this Officer retards and referring to us as SPED
(derogatory for special education students). This Officer as well as V #1
(Arriaga) continued to follow the defendant around the school to ensure his
safety as well as the other students but his behavior was getting to be more
and more tumultuous. This behavior continued for well over an hour with
staff pleading with him to just go home. At one point V #2 (Asst principal
Lisa Begley) tried to intervene to get the defendant to leave and he
threatened to get rid of her as well.

http://qedhav3/QED//policepartner/common/crimeweb/incview/main.jsp?agency=HAV-P... 4/23/2020

Finally after some more time going up and down the stairs the
defendant stated he was going to get his belongings and leave the building.
Upon heading down to the area of SSC he went into the bathroom in that
area and upon emerging stated he was ready to leave, however, he then
proceeded to go into SSC and continue his outlandish behavior. W #1
(Behavior specialist Lisa Santos) tried to intervene to help get the defendant
to comply with reasonable directives but he continued with his insults and
refused to take accountability for his actions. The defendant kept stating he
did nothing wrong even after all his behaviors had been pointed out to him.
He stated he has the right to take a break and one of the SSC student had
told him to come down to go to the gym together however that is not one of
the options on his behavior plan.
The defendant continued to be defiant and continued to berate all the
involved parties involved. W #2 (Asst principal Rich Poor) had also become
involved with attempting to have the defendant leave. W #2 (Poor)
contacted PA ( to advise her of his actions and she attempted to call
the defendant on his cell phone but he refused to take the call. PA (
had given permission for him to walk home as she has done in the past and
did confirm that he made it home safely. She was advised he would be
getting a summons to court. He continued to throw a ball in the air and
stated he did nothing wrong again even after all of us explained to him what
he had done wrong. Finally this Officer called the station to request an
ambulance be sent to the school to assist with having the defendant
removed from the building as a safety issue. Once called he did slowly leave
the building and exit the property.
Based on the above set of facts this Officer is requesting a summons for
the defendant as his behavior was tumultuous and amounted to fight words
with threats of bodily harm to staff members at the school. He also refused
to leave the property after being told to by the person lawfully in charge of
the property. Therefore, this Officer is requesting a summons for the
following:

While working in my capacity as a School Resource Officer at the
Consentino School on Tuesday 10/24/2017 at approximately 1200hrs this
Officer became aware of a situation involving the suspect,
acting out in school once again. S frequently refuses to follow staff
instruction and today once again he was refusing to comply with staff trying
to assist him with following regular expectations.
Earlier in the day S had recognized he was having a rough day and
asked to go to the in house suspension area and was allowed to do so. Once
there however, it became apparent he would not stay and began to roam the
school disrupting the learning environment. Teachers on the first floor of
the building needed to close their classroom doors while a staff followed
him around the building. This has been an ongoing pattern with S over the
past several weeks and happens at least 2 to 3 times per week. The decision
was made to try to ignore his behavior in an effort to remove his audience
hoping he would comply with staff instruction within a short period of time.
V #1 (AP Michael Jarvis) contacted PA ( to advise of
what was happening explaining this new strategy being used in an effort to
get him to comply with simple expectations all students adhere to in school.
PA ( was advised should his behavior escalate she would be contacted
to come to the school and would be given an opportunity to take S home
before it became necessary for this Officer to become involved and seek a
criminal complaint in court.
S was allowed to go to lunch but upon its completion he was instructed
to return to the main office and he refused. He then began to wander in the
cafeteria area of the building including the gym. Finally he was removed
from the gym area to the main hallway. During this interaction S became
aggressive with both V #1 (Jarvis) and V #2 (Principal John Mele) by
pushing them forcefully several times in an effort to go where he wanted
and not where he was directed.
At this point this Officer became involved and S stopped his assaultive
behavior. For the next 20 minutes S stood in the hallway being defiant,
refusing to return to the main office and was calling all staff member vulgar
names before finally sitting on the floor. Once again the classrooms in the
area were being disrupted and the teachers needed to close classroom doors
to combat the commotion in the hallway. V #1 (Jarvis) went to call PA
( and upon her arrival S did finally go to the main office. S was
subsequently disciplined by school officials who have also asked for his
removal from the school environment as he refuses to obey rules and this is
having an impact on the learning of other students in the building. V #1
(Jarvis) and V #2 (Mele) did not wish for this Officer to pursue charges
against S at this time as they do not believe this would be a proper avenue at
this time. The situation will be monitor going forward and charges could be
sought in the future. Nothing further at this time.",11,WHITE,MALE,"IANNALFO, S",PATROLMAN,,WHITE,FEMALE,APPROVED,,"JARVIS, MICHAEL",WHITE,MALE

an Acer laptop belonging to the school and threw it, causing it to break.

do about it. DiGloria did have redness around her eye. I offered medical
attention to DiGloria and Sigsworth and they declined medical attention.

at this time, but they did want the incident documented. While we were on
scene, was calm and cooperative. The staff declined to have him
sent to the hospital for an evaluation, and stated that they would be
contacting his grandmother who has custody of him.

The video consisted of several pictures of V in various posses but nothing
inappropriate. There was at least one that appeared to be photo shopped
where a withes nose was added to V face and others that were cropped to
show various body parts of V. While the video is playing there is a crazy
clown laugh audio playing at the same time. The video was sent in the form
of a text message and had been forwarded to PA (Vicki
RP (King) was advised we would look into the matter first thing in the
morning.
On Thursday 04/26/2018 this Officer with IP #1 (Principal John Mele)
and IP #2 (Assistant Principal Rich Poor) began to try to find out where the
video had originated. PA ( and V ( had come to
the school prior to this to meet with all of us. We inquired whether V
( had any idea who could have done this, if she was in an argument
with any other students at this time or if there were any students who held a
grudge against her but she was unable to think of anyone.
At this point we had all the listed IP's who are students at the school and
began to speak with them about this event. All information gathered led us
back to IP #4 ( and a phone number associated with her. Upon
checking we found the number was not hers and by lunch time we were
approached by IP #3 ( who stated she thought she could
find out who had made the video. Within a short period of time she and IP
#5 ( stated it was S ( who had made the video.
At this point we were going to try a new approach to see if S (
might admit making the video to IP #1 (Mele) and IP #2 (Poor) so this
Officer stepped away from the investigation. They both met with S for
several minutes while this Officer was not present but she would not admit
she was the one who made the video.
Later this same day this Officer received a call from PA
( in regards to the video. IP #5 ( had contacted V
( to state S ( had sent her a text message. A copy of that text
message was saved and the text message stated in effect I did do it but
please don't tell anyone. This Officer advised PA ( to
save the message and we would follow up with S in the morning.
On Friday 04/27/2018 this Officer spoke with several of the IP's, all of
them had a copy of the message from S admitting she had made the video,
however, S was absent from school on this date. Before the end of the day
IP #1 (Mele) attempted to contact the parent of S to advise them of a
meeting we wished to have with them on Monday to discuss the video. They
contacted the school several times asking to come in that afternoon to speak
about the video because they would be away.
At approximately 1545hrs both parents did in fact come to the school with
S and after initially denying she had anything to do with the video S did
finally admit that she had made the video. S Never gave any reason for
making the video. She was disciplined by the school officials. IP #1 (Mele)
did advise PA ( of what had happened.
On Monday 04/30/2018 this Officer did have a meeting with PA
( and advised her of what had happened. She was also
advised of her right to seek a harassment order on behalf of her daughter V.
She signed the form declining exercise her rights at this time. This Officer
also requested she send the video tome as well as the snapshot of the
admission. PA was satisfied with the actions taken so far and was explained
S would receive a warning on her return to remain away from V. There is
no further information at this time.",,WHITE,FEMALE,"IANNALFO, S",PATROLMAN,,,FEMALE,APPROVED,13,,WHITE,FEMALE

verify firearms ownership of the parents of S. Det. Benedetti did verify that
neither parents had been issued a license to carry or had ownership of any
listed firearms.
At this time this Officer responded to 1 South Grove St to speak with S
( ) as well as his parents ( and ). Upon
arrival they were just arriving at the home and were advised why this Officer
was present. This Officer began to speak with them in regards what had
been reported at this point. Initially S ( ) denied knowing why this
Officer was at his home and both parents stated he could not have made any
threats as they were at the school and just picked him up.
This Officer advised them S ( ) had in fact threatened to bring a gun
to school tomorrow and several students had overheard him make this
statement at the time of dismissal. The defendant then became very upset
but did admit to making the statement then added he was just kidding
around. Both parents then were advised of this Officer needing to check the
home for the presence of any firearms and both readily agreed to allow this
Officer to do so.
P #2 ( ) signed a search and seizure waiver, this Officer then did
check the home and did not locate any weapons at this time. This Officer
once again notified Capt. Pistone of this information and he advised this
Officer to make sure RP (Gage) was notified so RP (Gage) could contact the
superintendent's office. Both parents were advised S ( ) was being
suspended pending a hearing before the school principle and to have him in
school the next morning for that hearing. Both parents were also advised S
( ) should be taken to crisis for a mental health evaluation prior to
returning to school to ensure he is not a danger to himself or others, a 51A
will also be filed.
At the time of the writing of this report this Officer had not spoken to any
of the witnesses however, based on the information gathered to this point it
is this Officer's opinion this is not a credible threat. S ( ) does not have
access to any firearms within the home and did not understand the
ramifications of making such a statement within the school atmosphere.
RP (Gage) was advised this Officer would be at the school first thing in
the morning to follow-up on this report and gather the rest of the
information as well as speak with the witnesses to this event. At that time
this Officer will be filing a supplemental report with all the additional
information at that time. Currently there is no further information.",12,WHITE,MALE,"IANNALFO, S",PATROLMAN,,WHITE,MALE,APPROVED,,,,

school on Wednesday 01/23/2019 at approximately 1400hrs this Officer
was informed by RP (Asst. Principal Rich Poor) about a possible threat
made to shoot up the school. The report was made by IP #1 (&7th grade
teacher Lauren Kimball) who had received the report from IP #2 (

). In speaking with IP #2 ( ) he stated he was told about

the comment by IP #3 ( ).
At this time this Officer called down the suspect, < to ask
why he would make such a threat. He stated he did not make a threat and
when asked he denied he was going to do that to the school. This Officer
spoke with both IP #2 ( ) and IP #3 ( ), IP #2 ( )
could not add any other info to the incident at this time. This Officer then
spoke with IP #3 ( ). At first IP #3 ( ) could not articulate why he
had spoken to S about shooting up the school. IP #3( ) just kept saying
S was acting sketchy today. Asked to elaborate and he could not give this
Officer an explanation of that terminology.
This Officer began to press IP #3 ( ) explaining that there must have
been a reason he thought S would shoot up the school. S is a fairly new
student to our school as he was enrolled in Amesbury prior to coming to
Haverhill. IP #3 finally did state that some time ago they were talking and S
was boasting about having a Glock and an AR-15 under his bed. With the
suspicious activity interpreted by IP #3 ( ) today he then asked S if he
was going to shoot up the school and S shrugged his shoulders but then
later said he was not going to shoot up the school.
At this point this Officer attempted to contact PA ( ), his
mother, but was unable to do so at that time. The determination was made
to go to the home to speak with her. Prior to leaving the school this Officer
did contact Capt. Pistone to inform him of the incident and advise of the
course of action this Officer was planning with respect to S.
We then went to the home at but found PA ( )
was not at home although there was a sibling on scene who was making an
effort to contact PA ( ). This Officer was trying to contact her and was
finally able to reach her. She immediately responded to the home. This
officer explained the situation and she did allow this officer access to S
bedroom. It was searched and there were no weapons in the room at this
time. PA was advised S would be suspended by the school and due to return
on Monday 01/28/2019.
PA ( ) was explained S would be introduced to our adjustment
counselor upon his return so that he would have that as a resource to use
while in school. Further, a referral would be done for the S to receive in
school counseling. It was also strongly suggested that she contact the crisis team to see if an evaluation would be needed. PA ( ) was given the
phone number to mobile crisis to have them come to the home in the event
she was unable to take him to them. This Officer did also check the DCJIS
to see if PA ( ) had an LTC or any guns registered to her and found
she did not at this time. The situation will be monitored going forward but
this Officer believes this was not a credible threat made by S. The school
was notified of the findings of this Officer. There is no further action to be

Upon arrival at the Nettle school this Officer was briefed by RP,

on to state the threat had been heard by the office staff as he was not
present. All three of the office staff had witnessed the threat by S and gave
statements which were held by this Officer. In summary they stated S was
in the office because of some behavior issues in class unrelated to this issue.
At some point he began making disparaging remarks about RP (Corkery)
and at one point referred to others there as his back-up for when he shoots
up RP (Corkery).
S has a history of mental health issues and has been at programs out of
school to address these issues. Both parents have been very responsive to
his needs and helpful to the school whenever there are any issues with S
behavior. PA #2 ( ) was on scene with PA #1 ( ) and
was stating they are very agreeable to having S screened through crisis. PA
#2 ( ) was also checked to see if he has a valid LTC and was found to
not have one at this time. It was learned the parents had been living in their
car for a short time but are now staying in a hotel in New Hampshire. A 51A
was filed in the past and the school has been aware of this issue and has
been working with the family. During the time they were homeless S has
been staying with a IP ( ) at and continues to stay
there so that he can continue to attend the Nettle School. Based on the
information from the parents this Officer also filed a 51A on behalf of the
child. Both were queried about S having access to any weapons and stated
he did not have any weapons. Both parents left the school with S and were
taking him to see the crisis team. Prior to returning to school they will bring
the paperwork clearing S of being a harm to himself or others. Both were
advised upon his return to school he will be checked to ensure he is not bringing any weapons onto the property. RP (Corkery) is aware there is no

law however, he wished to document the incident to be safe. There is

I had taken friends (RP) and (Patient) into my office due to them disagreeing in the hallway. I had both ladies in so
they could work out the disagreement they were having. In the middle of
our conversations, stated that said that she wanted to cut
herself and kill herself. I then stopped the conversation and asked
if she did say those things today and she said she had.
I then asked her why she felt this way and explained to me that
she feels no one cares for her and no one listens. She has a lot of things
going on at home and at school and no one cares about her at all. It was also
brought up that has cut herself in the past, but since this incident,
she promised she would not do it again. I did look at her arms and no
cuts were noted at this time.
This is not the first time has made these statements, and she does
have an action plan in place with the school if she begins to say these things
or has these feelings. I then advised the school Principle Mr. Mele of the
situation as well as the Adjustment Counselor. 's father,
, was then contacted and he arrived at the school to take
to Crisis for an evaluation.

public on . It had turned into a disturbance between two parents
involving their daughters.
She advised the parents I would be reaching out to them. I then received a
phone call from one of the IP's father this morning on the matter as well. I
then called the father, (father to IP ) he
expressed his concerns for his daughter due to recent events and I explained
I would be going over to Hunking School to speak with the staff and talk
with the girls as well.
Mr. relayed to me that he was worried his daughter was going to be
jumped again by a particular party (IP ) whose mother was part
of yesterdays disturbance. I asked if he was one of the parents on the scene
yesterday and he explained he was not but had heard about it and that was
why he was calling.
I then went over to Hunking Middle School to speak with Principal
Shannon Nolan and update her on the situation that had occurred the
evening prior. She explained that Parent, had already been in
this morning to let them know what had happened. I then asked to speak
with the girls separately to find out what had happened. I first called the
girls parents to inform them I would be talking with them to hopefully end
whatever issues were going on. Both mothers were fine with this.
I first spoke with . explained that while walking home
yesterday from school and a friend of hers' were up ahead of them
and the friend kept looking back and staring at them. Then and the

foot up you A"". She then goes on to say that words were exchanged between
all the girls but then called for her step-father to be (IP ) to
pick her up. She said she explained what happened to him and that is when
he decided to go over to 's house on the matter.
I explained to both the girls that this needed to end and they need to stay
away from each other; the school has already moved their classes, so they are no longer in any class together. I also explained they need to let their
friends know to stop getting involved as they seem to be causing more
problems. Mrs. Nolan was aware of the friends, and they were going to be
having a meeting with all the girls to put an end to this. I advised them that
if there are any problems to let a teacher know or call for me and I will come
over to help.

Travis reported the threat to Elizabeth and Eileen. Elizabeth stated that the
bathroom was then locked and police were called.
Eileen stated that MCAS testing is currently in session and this section of
the school where the threat was found only had a few classes scheduled on
that floor. Eileen also stated that this particular bathroom is not one that is
often used.
I then spoke with school custodian, George Smith, who stated that he was in
this particular boys bathroom around 06:34 hours this morning to clean it
and did not observe any threats written on the walls.
Myself and Sgt. Smith then conducted a sweep of the school with the Eileen,
George and Elizabeth. All staff members present stated that all exterior
doors, maintenance closets, and unused classrooms on the 1st floor where
the bathroom was located were locked. The only room that was open was
the girls and boys bathrooms as well as a room that stored special
equipment for children with mobility issues. These rooms were all checked
and the staff stated that nothing seemed out of place and no other threats
were found.
I observed in the handicap stall in the 1st floor boys bathroom, ""Bomb is here"" written in pencil on the wall near the toilet paper holder (see photo).
It should be noted that this is the second time in a month that a bomb
threat has been written in this bathroom (see incident #:19010666).
When asked if there were any students who could be displaying any red
flags or could have possibly done something like this, staff members stated
that they couldn't think of anyone at this time.
After speaking with staff and conducting a protective sweep of the school
and of areas where staff members asked, it was determined that the threat
assessment level was zero. Sgt. Smith advised Captain R. Pistone and I
advised school principle Timothy Corkery of this upon his arrival.
Timothy went through the security camera footage and was able to provided
a list of twelve names of adults and students that entered the boys bathroom

four students were seen entering the bathroom during the last bomb threat.
Timothy did show me that at 10:08 hours, student,

was observed entering the boys bathroom without a pencil in his
hand however upon exiting at 10:16 hours, is holding a pencil in
his hand (see attached photo).
When asked for a copy of the video footage and the face sheets for each
listed student, Timothy stated that SRO N. Donnelly and the school
secretary have access and will be able to retrieve those requested items
tomorrow during school hours. A photo of a handwritten list of those
entering and exiting the bathroom has been attached to this report. SRO

a small bruise on the inner side of her wrist. Doherty asked what
had happened to her wrist. stated her mother hit her with a
recorder, which upset her because it belonged to the school. said
this morning her brother repeatedly shined a light in her eyes
and wouldn't stop. said because wouldn't stop she hit him in
the back. also said she was practicing playing her recorder this
morning when she wasn't supposed to. Between the two incidents of hitting
Isreal and playing her recorder she said her mother hit her on the wrist with
the recorder which caused it to snap in half. Doherty asked if felt
safe being at home. She stated home is the only place she feels safe although
she doesn't think is safe because he throws things around the house.
She said her mother tries to protect her from that.
Doherty, McCarter and I then went to to speak with

frustration and breaking the recorder.
I did observe the handle of a pink plastic recorder on the coffee table in the living room. The mouth piece had been broken apart from the handle and
was on the floor beneath the couch that stated she was sitting on.
Photographs were taken, and the recorder was logged into evidence.
Doherty spoke with her supervisor and the decision was made that the
children would remain with for the weekend with a safety plan in
place. I then advised Detective Sgt. Brown of the updates. At that point it
was determined there would be no criminal charges as it did not appear that
intentionally struck with the recorder.
Shortly after leaving the house I received a phone call from Doherty stating
she had spoken with Isreal, who is autistic. Isreal said threw the
recorder on the floor which hit in the foot. Doherty then spoke with
, 's 10 year old sister. told Doherty she saw

then locked up the bathroom and called Mr. Corkery.

capacity of SRO for J.G. Whittier Middle School got a call from dispatch
about a child who was giving the Principal a hard time at school.
I then asked dispatch to find out what was going on with the child, while in
route from Nettle Middle School it was then relayed that the child had
assaulted the Principal and has now left the school. I then requested
another cruiser to the school in case a search was needed. A brief
description of the young man was given while on our way to the school,
Hispanic male, wearing a black hooded sweatshirt and a black backpack.
When I arrived at the school, I could see the young man, now know to me as
passing back and forth on school grounds. Officer Birch,

car #4, had then arrived as back up.
I was able to get to stop walking away from me and come back to
the school so we could figure out what was going on. He was upset, and
when asked what was going on he explained the Principal had put his hands
on him and he was done and wanted to go home. I explained we would call
his mother and get this all figured out. Outside with us was Timothy Betty
(The V.P.). Betty explained he had been outside with just keeping
an eye on him in case he walked away completely from the school.
Betty then gave me a quick rundown of the events he knew about. He
explained that renovations have just been made to the 7th/8th-grade boy's
bathroom and just the other day it was vandalized. Through the school's
investigation name had kept coming up, so the Principal
(Defendant/victim) Brian Gill had asked Betty to find and send
him down to his office. He stated the next thing he knew was
coming out of the back door and Principal Gill was asking for the Police to
be called. He is unaware of what took place in between.
As we were outside, Principal Gill had come out; he appeared to have a
mark under his right eye. I asked him what was going on and he explained
the following: He had asked for to come down so he could
investigate the vandalism that was done to the bathroom. When
showed up, he was already swearing and upset. Gill says he told him to calm down and they would discuss what was going on, asked to talk
with his mother, and Gill stated he couldn't call his mom, he would be
calling her. This upset and he stated he was leaving; Gill stated he
wasn't leaving and got up and began to walk down the hall. Gill
stated he followed while was yelling and swearing at him, calling
him names and giving him the middle finger. Also following both
and Gill was math teacher (Witness), Wilkinson Legrand. Gill explained
that he kept telling he was not leaving and even got in front of him
to keep him from moving past him. At this point, he states this is when
was saying he was going to punch him if he didn't get away, when
Gill states he told he doesn't have the balls to hit him. This is
when Gill states hit him, twice (photo attached with a mark). Mr.
Legrand then got in the middle of them and both he and left the
school. I did ask Mr. Gill if he would like any medical attention and he
declined these services.
I then went and spoke with Mr. Legrand about what he had witnessed. Mr.
Legrand explained that he happened to be in the office when was
there and the yelling going on between him and Mr. Gill. He said he had
followed in hopes to attempt to de-escalate but he was
very upset and was swearing down the hall. He did say how was
stating he was going to punch Mr. Gill if he didn't get away from him and
this is when Mr. Gill stated back he didn't have the balls. Mr. Legrand stated
that things escalated very quickly and he then got in the middle of both
parties without trying to put his hands on as he is not trained to
restrain kids. I did ask if he witnessed hitting Mr. Gill and he
stated everything happened so fast he does not recall hitting Mr.
Gill. He did say once in between he was able to direct out of the
building to try and calm him down.
After speaking with both parties, Mr. Betty then informed me he had
spoken with mother and informed her of the situation and how I
would be driving him home.
I then drove home to his mother, I explained to her
what had happened and wanted to talk with about his version, as
he had explained to me at the school already Mr. Gill had grabbed him and
threw him up against the locker. Ms. was upset, understandable but
she did allow me to talk with I first read her their Miranda
Rights, and she explained she understood and was allowing me to speak
with and ask him questions. I then had explain what
happened. stated that he was outside playing and had heard a lot
of talk about the boy's bathroom being destroyed, but he didn't do any of it. So he was upset he got called down to the Principals office. He said when he
arrived; he asked to call his mom because he was being accused, he said Mr.
Gill said no he couldn't. Then Mr. Gill said, one of these days you're gonna
get fucking beat up and you're gonna get arrested watch. So said
he was going to leave then, Mr. Gill said, No you aren't, and then
walked away swearing. He did say he was using the ""N"" word and called Mr.
Gill a Fucking Bitch. said that he got his bag and Mr. Gill came
over grabbed him by the arm and slammed him into the locker, and he said
Mr. Gill said to him ""Come on hit me,"" and said no. Mr. Legrand
then got in the middle, and he walked out of the school. I did ask him if he
hit Mr. Gill and said he did not put his hands on him. (photo

I then explained to that I would most likely be putting in for a Court
Hearing on the matter as well as cross complaints on both parties, as they
both are stating they were Assaulted. She stated she understood. I also
advised her to take to the Hospital if she felt he needed further
care for his arm and due to her being very upset, advised her to reach out to
the school Superintendent on the matter.
Upon leaving, I called and spoke with Superintendent Margaret Moratta on
this matter. I explained a 51A would be filled on behalf. She
stated she understood and would be taking appropriate action with Mr. Gill.
She would also call DCF in the morning as well.
Both Haverhill District and Lawrence Juvenile Courts declined to issue
complaints on either party. I called both parties and advised as such and
informed them they may seek their own complaints at their respected
courts.
I followed up with DCF case worker Stacey Carey who was assigned the
case. She informed me that during her investigation a Special Ed Teacher,
Mary Senior, had come forward after to say she had seen a fist from the
student going at Mr. Gill's chin and landing. Her statement to Ms. Carey
was: She had heard yelling, a child yelling, she then walked towards the
fired door, witnessed Mr. Gill and Mr. Legrand with the kid. She saw a lot of
movement going on and then a fist going to Mr. Gill's chin and landing, she
then turned away because it was to upsetting to watch Mr. Gill get hit.
Photos were attached to this report as well of both Mr. Gill's eye and

arm.

No further information at this time. On May 30, 2019, I followed up with Mary Senior as DCF stated they had
talked to her regarding this incident. I then went to J.G. Whittier to speak
with her myself. As I was there and talking with Mr. Betty, he also informed
me that the school Nurse Kelsie Cartwright had witnessed the incident as
well.
I asked if I could speak with both parties regarding what they had
witnessed.
I spoke with Kelsie Cartwright first, and this is what she stated: She heard
them (Gill and in the hallway while she was in her Office. She
heard yelling and could hear Gill walking after him. She then
came out of her office and witnessed Gill, and Legrand all
intertwined together and saw arm come up twice hitting Gill.
She did state everyone was grabbing at each other during this. She stated
she then called for Betty on the Walkey talkie to get help, but by this time,
was walking out of the building towards Betty. She tended to Gill
as he had a cut under his eye. She also tended to but during this
time he stated he was fine and nothing hurt, when she witnessed this Officer
outside talking with him and taking a photo of his arm, she came back out
to check on him and did note there was red on his arm and got him an ice
pack. I did ask if she had heard anything that was said, and she stated she
did not.
I then spoke with Mary Senior, and this is what she stated: She was in the
hallway when she noticed the commotion in the 7th/8th-grade hall. She
walked to the fire doors, where one was shut and another open and saw the

O'Connell, was also dispatched.
The reporting party is Kayla Pellot, the Behavioral Specialist assigned to this
school. Ms. Pellot informed me that the patient, is a
Behavioral Student with many emotional issues. Mr. was very
disruptive during the school day. His antics started as yelling in the halls
and pushing other students in the hallway. One of the substitute teachers,
Mr. Michael Veves, witnessed these actions and confronted Mr.
advising him to stop. Mr. then began to push Mr. Veves with his
shoulder until he was able to pass. Mr. Veves stated that he was nearly
driven to the floor by Mr.

realized it was the beginning of a behavior outburst by Mr. Mr.
Ryan attempted to intervene in a friendly manner, but Mr. had
already decided to make matters worse.
Mr. began running in the hallways, yelling he was going to hit and
kill anyone who tried to stop him, that he just wanted to be left alone, and
for everyone to ""just fuck off."" Mr. also punched several lockers.
Ms. Pellot and two other staff members attempted to calm Mr. and
to corral him into a secluded area to shield the other students from his
shenanigans. These attempts failed, and the three began to chase Mr.

around the sides of the school until I arrived.

I began to talk to Mr. in a friendly, calm voice explaining to him
that he was now in control and asking him what he wanted or needed. Mr.
refused to co-operate and insisted on screaming obscenities at me
and threaten to punch me and watch me burn in hell. Officer O'Connell
arrived on the scene during this protest. I advised Officer O'Connell to
remain away from Mr. until the ambulance arrived and that I
would stay close to prevent any harm or issues.
Trinity EMS arrived on the scene. I told Officer O'Connell that he would
need to hold Mr. until the medics could gain control of him as he
has repeatedly stated that he was not going in the ambulance or to any
hospitals. When I approached Mr. on the grassy area closest to
door #3, in the rear of the school, he put his fists up and demanded I stay
away. I gently reached for his left arm and held onto him in a ""bear-hug""
fashion. This action prevented him from striking anyone and also ensured he would not be harmed. While doing this, I asked if he would rather be on
the ground, and he stated yes. We went to the ground together, and I
continued to hold him to prevent any injury to him or me.
Mr. realized his struggle was useless, and he voluntarily got onto
the stretcher and was transported to the Holy Family at Merrimack Valley
Hospital by Trinity EMS. A teacher went to the hospital with Mr.
(she rode in the front seat) another teacher drove his personal vehicle to the
hospital to provide the first teacher with transportation back to the school.
Ms. Pellot contacted Mr. mother, and informed
her of the incident.

requested by Detective Sgt Brown to meet DCF for an emergency response.
A 51A was filed at Consentino Middle School for a child that had sustained
an injury that was possibly caused by a teacher.
I met Emily Dello Russo from DCF at the Salvation Army located on
Merrimac St. Dello Russo told me that DCF had received a report from the
principal John Mele that a 14 year old student had his finger
jammed in a filing cabinet that had been kicked by a teacher at
the school.
Inside the Salvation Army Dello Russo and I met with and his
mother, said she was contacted by the school and
was advised on what had happened and was instructed to seek medical
treatment for stated that she did take to the doctor and
was told he had two sprained fingers. then showed me his left hand. I
observed his middle finger and ring taped together. The tips of both of his
fingers did appear to have some redness and bruising along his nail bed,
and on the underside of the tips of his fingers.
Dello Russo then spoke to and asked what had happened at school
today. told her in Ms. class once the students finish their work
they are to get candy from the a drawer in a filing cabinet inside the
classroom. said although he was supposed to complete a star math
test and hadn't, Ms. told him he could have some candy. said as
he reached his fingers inside of the filing cabinet, Ms. kicked the
drawer shut. fingers were inside the drawer at the time, and got
stuck inside. said the school nurse had to come into the classroom to
dislodge his fingers from the cabinet. decribed the nurse using a
screw driver and a hammer to pry the drawer open. Dello Russo asked
if he thought Ms. kicked the drawer closed on purpose.
said he thought it was an accident, and said if his teacher ever hurt him he
would punch them in the face. then told us there were two other
students in the classroom when the incident happened. He only knew their
names as and Through the 51A filed we were able to determine was
and was On 5/18/19 Dello Russo and I met with
and his mother at DCF's office. said he was in the
classroom when fingers got stuck in the cabinet. He said Ms.
told he could get candy. said he thought Ms. believed
was getting candy for another student who was not to have
any. said Ms. ran over to the cabinet and kicked it hard on
purpose. said and Ms. typically don't get along in class
because he swears at her.
On 5/20/19 Dello Russo and I met with and his mother,
said he was in the classroom with and

said Ms. told if he behaved he could get some candy.
then said he could just take the candy when he wanted, and then
walked over to the filing cabinet. He said he then saw Ms. run over to
the drawer and kicked it as hard as she could.
Dello Russo and I both reached out to Ms. for an interview. We were
each referred to Ms. attorney Kahreem Morgan. On behalf of Ms.
Morgan stated that she would not be willing to be interviewed by either the
police department or DCF. Morgan did provide a written statement from
Ms. on her account of the incident which has been attached. In
summary the statement says that asked if he could have candy which
she stated no. then walked over behind her desk and attempted to
take the candy. Ms. stated she walked over to the filing cabinet to close
it and stated that fingers accidentally got stuck inside. Ms. said
her intention was to prevent from taking candy, not to injure him and
stated it was an accident.
I reached back out to She told me fingers have since healed,
and although Ms. is no longer employed at Consentino she would like
to pursue the matter further. said she does not want to see
something like this happen to another child.
Due to the conflicting statements of the victim and the two witnesses, and
being unable to speak with Ms. regarding the allegations, I respectfully
request a hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe
Ms. intentionally kicked the drawer closed causing the injuries to
fingers.

Officer at Consentino Middle School. At approximately 1300hrs I was
notified by Assistant Principal Poor that a teacher wanted to report students
sending inappropriate pictures to each other.
I met with teacher Lisa Santos who informed me that she was approached
by a student who wanted to report that a 7th grade student was telling

multiple people that he was in possession of a nude picture of his ex-
girlfriend. Santos stated that she was informed that

and Santos advised me that is one of her students
and that she approached him about the picture. told her that he did
have a picture of but that his cellphone was at home. Santos also
advised me that was not in school today.
I met with and he stated that he did have a picture of from a
couple weeks ago but that he did not want the picture sent to him. He then
informed me that his phone was at home with his mother. I explained to

possess the photograph on his phone. I informed that I would be
speaking with all parties involved and speaking with parents as well.
I met with about what was reported. She stated that the whole grade
has been talking about this and that it is a rumor has started
because she does not like him anymore. stated that she has never
taken any photos of herself and that is making the story up and
showing people a fake picture that is not her. was upset and
understood that the incident was being looked into. stated that I

inappropriate photo to anyone. I advised her that I would be contacting her

believes that her daughter is not involved and that it is turning into
a harassment issue. stated that she would leave the phone at school
with me if it was needed for the investigation. provided me the
phone passcode and then powered the phone down. I informed her that I
would be continuing the investigation and speaking with the school about
the bullying issues surrounding the incident. At 1830hrs I met with mother She informed me that
a few days ago her son mentioned that his ex-girlfriend sent him a nude
picture of her chest. never saw the picture herself but stated that she
believes it was sent to her son. She was unaware of it being an issue in
school and was under the impression the photo was deleted. I spoke with
again in the presence of his mother. stated that he did not
have any nude pictures on his phone because it was sent in a Snapchat
conversation. then stated that he did have the photo and was
looking through his phone. I observed and he was not looking into
any apps or photo galleries. I then asked if he ever had a picture
and he stated he has it but did not save it. changed his story
multiple times about whether the photo was on his phone or not. I then
advised them I would be continuing the investigation. I spoke with
about confiscating cellphone for the investigation. had no
issues with my request and agreed that I would keep the cell phone for now.

who was not in school today informed me he was aware of the
incident because all the kids were talking about it. I informed of the
incident and informed her that her son was being accused of having a nude
photo of understood the allegations but did not believe her
son was directly involved and that the hearsay was just the kids making
things up. informed me that he did not have a picture on his phone
and that he never saw any nude pictures. stated that was
talking to him and telling him he had a picture of on his phone.
stated that asked him if he wanted the picture but he
refused. did not want to get involved and asked to leave
him out of it. I advised that I would be continuing the investigation
and that I just wanted to make her aware of the possible involvement her
son may have. was not comfortable turning over her son's cellphone
since there were no actual pictures that anyone has reported seeing. I
informed her that I would be continuing the investigation and I advised

to not speak about the incident to peers.

Investigation to continue. I met with each child about the safety concerns of sending inappropriate
pictures of themselves or anyone else. They were all advised of the severity
of the incident and we spoke about the charge of possessing or
disseminating nude photos of a minor. They all understood and we had an
open discussion about preventing this type of incident in the future. I
advised all involved parents that the investigation would be closed and that
if they continue to have concerns surrounding bullying/harassment about
the incident to contact myself or the school administration. Due to there
being a lack of evidence and probable cause that a nude picture exists, there
will be no charges filed at this time. If there are any future reports of the
behavior with the involved parties, I will re-open the investigation.

has no problems at home but that her behavior elevates at school
due to the large classes and people. She willingly stated that would
be better off in a smaller school with less students due to her ADHD. She
stated that when she arrived at the school she was able to calm
down by giving her a stress ball and rocking her back and forth until she
was calm. At this time, was seated in the backseat of
vehicle, calm and content. I asked if she was injured due to the
assault and she stated she was not and declined any need for medical
attention. I suggested that she consider sending to the hospital to
speak to someone about her anger and other issues. declined those
services and stated that she would follow up with her primary care doctor
after the weekend.

A 51A was filed with DCF over the phone and by mail on behalf of
Mr. Parker stated that he will be handling the discipline for

Officer. At approximately 1200hrs I dispatched to the lobby of the police
station for a report of an assault that occurred at Hunking Middle School.
Once I arrived I met with parent who informed me that her son
was hit by a teacher yesterday 6/12/19 and that he now has a

concussion.
I spoke with and I asked him what happened yesterday. He
informed me he was in the hallway with a teacher Ms. Hoover playing a
reading game called Bump. explained that bump is a reading
game. He explained that one person starts and that when they are finished
reading a section they bump a person to read the next section.
stated they do not actually bump into anyone but that when you bump
someone you are just verbally choosing them to read the next section.
stated that after reading his section he bumped Ms. Hoover.
stated that after he chose Ms. Hoover to go next she hit him in the
right side of the head with a hard cover book. I asked what type of book it
was and he stated it was not a text book and just a regular book that she
brought. stated that after she hit him with the book he asked her
why she hit him. version of her response was, ""big deal I
assaulted you."" stated that after that he went on with his day and
did not tell anyone about it. stated that it happened sometime
before lunch but was unable to tell me what time. stated that it
happened in the hallway located right outside Mrs. Mastropiero's
classroom.
stated that this morning around 0400hrs her son woke up and threw
up. stated that after that he went back to sleep. woke for
school and he told her he was embarrassed to go. then asked him what
happened that would cause those feelings. reported to her that
yesterday he was hit by a teacher with a book and that his head hurt. She
then brought to Lawrence General Hospital to be checked out and
she reported that he was discharged with post concussion symptoms.
informed me she went to the school and met with Principal Nolan about the
incident.
I went to the school and spoke with Principal Nolan about the allegations. I
was informed by teacher Mrs. Mastropiero that Mrs. Hoover is a
volunteer who comes into the school to assist children with reading. Mrs.
Hoover takes small groups of children out of their classrooms to work on improving their reading skills. I advised Mrs. Mastropiero of the allegations
and she immediately stated that it could not have happened yesterday
because did not get pulled out of class by Mrs. Hoover or any
other teacher. Mrs. Mastropiero stated that Mrs. Hoover only pulls students
from her classroom on Mondays and that must be confusing the
days. Myself, Principal Nolan, and Asst. Principal Gage all checked the
cameras located directly outside of Mrs. Mastropiero's classroom.
was never seen getting pulled out of class. Mrs. Hoover also did not hold
any reading groups in the 4th grade area that alleges the incident
occurred. I contacted and informed her what the teachers and
administration reported. asked her son again if he was sure it happened
yesterday. I then heard in the background state yes it was
Monday. I then asked Mrs. Mastropiero if he participated in the group
Monday and she stated no. Mrs. Mastropiero stated that sometimes she
sends different students to go to the reading group with Mrs. Hoover. Mrs.
Hoover was at the school on Monday 6/10/19 from 10:00am-11:00am. Mrs.
Mastropiero informed me that this past Monday 6/10/19 she picked a group
of different students to attend the group. She informed me that
was begging to be picked but that he gets chosen often ad she wanted to give
other students the opportunity. After not being picked he got upset with
Mrs. Mastropiero. I watched the cameras for the time frame Mrs. Hoover
was there and she met with a group of 4 students. was not one of
the students participating and he is only seen on camera during that
timeframe walking out to grab a drink of water. He does not interact with
the reading group and is seen walking directly back into his classroom.
Once Mrs. Hoover finishes the group the students walk back into the
classroom and the class then walks down the stairs to lunch.
At this point I was notified that and arrived back at the school
to give me more information. stated that after speaking with me
further he was confused and told her that it happened yesterday. I
informed them that I already watched the video and that there were no
children pulled out of Mrs. Mastropiero's class yesterday. I asked
if he was sure it happened yesterday. He was adamant that it occurred
yesterday and gave me the names of four other students who were pulled
out with him. I called down

. I brought them into an office and advised them I had a couple
questions about their school day. I did not inform them of the incident I was
investigating or mention name. I first asked if any of them were
pulled out of class for any reason yesterday. They all shook their heads and
told me no. I then asked if they are ever picked to meet with Mrs. Hoover.
They all told me that they have met with Mrs. Hoover together. I asked
them if they met with her this week and they all replied no. The group was then sent back into their classroom.
I advised and that the incident could not have occurred
yesterday because Mrs. Hoover did not go into Mrs. Mastropiero's
classroom. then stated that she believed the school was covering up the
incident and that she believed they were protecting Mrs. Hoover. I then
informed that I spoke with the other students that claims
were with him and they denied any claims of being pulled out of class or
even seeing Mrs. Hoover yesterday. then continued to believe her son
and made allegations of the school administration editing the surveillance
tapes. I informed that school employees do not have access to edit
surveillance footage. I asked multiple times if he was sure the
incident happened yesterday and he stated yes. He denied anything
happening any other day and would not change any part of his story.
While I was speaking with Principal Nolan further, two of the school
adjustment counselors and one guidance counselor informed me that
has multiple issues in school and that he has made multiple
allegations in the past about being injured by teachers. Principal Nolan
informed me that all allegations were investigated by the school and
determined to be false allegations. has also admitted to making up
a story about Asst. Principal Gage hurting him. Principal Nolan advised me
she was filing a 51a for the allegations.
I contacted Candice Hoover to get a statement from her. I informed Hoover
that there were some allegations being made by I advised
Hoover of account of what happened. Hoover immediately
informed me that she did not see yesterday. She stated that she
has not seen him for awhile. Hoover stated that a few weeks ago
was in her reading group and was acting out of control and constantly
interrupting members of the group that were reading. Hoover stated that
she tapped in the hand with a thin paper book to get his attention.
Hoover stated that stated, ""you just assaulted me."" Hoover stated
that she apologized and reminded of the rules of the reading
group. Hoover stated that she would never hit a child in the head with
anything and that she is shocked that is telling that to people. I
advised Hoover that I filed a 51A with the Department of Children &
Families for the incident.

is not with Mrs. Hoover at any time on Tuesday 6/11/19. There is no further information at this time.",,,FEMALE,"BRIGNAC, G",PATROLMAN,,WHITE,FEMALE,APPROVED,9,,WHITE,MALE
