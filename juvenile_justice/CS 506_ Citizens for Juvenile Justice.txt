        The “Citizens for Juvenile Justice” project will primarily focus on police-civilian interactions in specific towns and cities of Massachusetts. The primary motivation for the project derives from wanting to gain a better understanding of any existing relationship between police-involved encounters and the race of the civilians participating in such experiences. A myriad of datasets have been provided by the project’s client, including arrest data in New Bedford that contains variables on the specifics of arrests in the city, such as the location of arrests, as well as the age, sex, and race of the civilians’ involved. Since we have access to data on the specific locations of each officer-related incident in New Bedford (latitude and longitude variables are available), we can attempt to determine if certain locations in the city are more likely to include incidents than other areas. As advised by our client, we can also examine data from 2015 up until the current year and group police cases with age categories, and then subsequently map these groupings with location and race. The result would be an analysis of arrests across age, race, gender and location.
Moreover, an additional inspiration for the project includes the desire to more accurately perceive how certain facets of local police departments, such as police pay, overtime pay, and budgets for the police in certain areas may affect officers’ actions. Our client is still in the process of obtaining data that will tell us which specific officers have been involved in actions such as “field interrogation reports” (stop-and-frisks) and adding people to the city’s gang member database. So, it’s currently very difficult to make the connection between police pay and officers’ behavior, but if that data becomes available from the New Bedford PD in the near future, we will have a major new avenue to explore. For now, our client is interested in understanding more general trends in police spending in New Bedford, so creating some visualizations of where the police department’s budget ends up will be on our agenda. In particular, we will look to break down officers’ pay between regular salary and overtime, and we will use a list of disciplinary cases from the past several years to investigate whether there are particular officers who both receive high compensation and face complaints frequently. In addition, we will look into whether officers for whom disciplinary accusations were “sustained” were still employed by the New Bedford PD years afterwards, although our ability to do this is limited because the only payroll datasource we currently have access to is from 2017.
